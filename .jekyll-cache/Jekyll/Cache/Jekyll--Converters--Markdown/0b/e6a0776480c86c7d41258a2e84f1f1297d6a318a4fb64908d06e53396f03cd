<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Revo is alive.  With 2 The Signals (both are in reserve deck, as you start w/ Careful Planning), and 2 WAYTTPOU, the evaders wonâ€™t be in their deck for long.  If they start Crush, donâ€™t dep. a Revo. until you get a grabber and have 3 force saved.</p>

<p>Basically drain in space (and if they can scrape together enough force to get a ship out, use the landing claws), and on the ground.  Not much drain potential, but the strength is battling.  Battle as much as possible (especially against an ISB deck).  The only weakness is SFS, but revo Walkeemi, and if they control, all their TIEs are dep. +2, and landing claws on their dreadnaughts, or other capital ships, and revo all their systems, so they drain less, etc.  If needed, stick a pilot on a ship, and battle then go undercover.</p>

<p>Oola helps take away characters, and Yoxgit is neat tech (though everyone knows it).  Get out Battle Plan, as you can afford to drain, they canâ€™t, Goo Nee Tay (HDADJ got 10 force for vader and Tarkin?  Dep. Goo Nee Tay, only vader comes down, beat him up, or if oola is out, take them both away).  Trans. Term. to stop visage.  Basically Revo still rocks the house â€˜</p>
