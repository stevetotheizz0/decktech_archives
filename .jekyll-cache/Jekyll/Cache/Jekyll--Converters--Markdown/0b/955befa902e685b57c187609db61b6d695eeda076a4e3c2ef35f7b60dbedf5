<p>Crush the Rebellion</p>

<p>There is no try &amp; Oppressive Enforcement</p>

<p>First Turn, deploy Cloud City East Platform.  Use Crush to get either I Have You Know or Evader &amp; Monnok.</p>

<p>Here’s the tech, set up at the Chasm Walkway. Use Vader, Mara, Boba, Dengar, and Dr. E &amp; Ponda to send characters to the Weather Vane. Here is why I like to play with the Weather Vane. During battle, I can get rid of a lot of high power/ability/battle destiny adding characters. Send them to the vane to get rid of them. This is tech for battles. Also, characters on the vane can’t be re-deployed. It’s nice to have Han sitting on the vane and not running around.</p>

<p>Also, use Shattered Hope to send characters flying to the Weather Vane.  If you win a battle and Jedi Luke is still hanging around, just send him to the weather vane.</p>

<p>Evader and Monnok allows you to keep a control over the opponent’s hand.</p>

<p>I have 2 grabbers. Use those to get Harvest (first priority), The Bith Shuffle &amp; Desperate Reach (Second), and other cycling cards. Most players play with The Bith Shuffle &amp; Desperate reach because they can use the card to cancel Imperial barrier or shuffle reserve decks. That’s good. If they play it to shuffle a reserve deck, grab the card. That stops the opponent from getting characters off of the weather vane.</p>

<p>Sniper does make the characters lost, not sent to the weather vane (sniper card is the top action), but it does add 3 to lightsaber draws. That can help for an Obi-Wan, Luke, Leia W/, Chewie w/, ect.</p>

<p>I have removed Han from Watch Your Step decks.  This deck can also remove other key characters as well by having them sit on the weather vane.</p>

<p>If you want, give Han to jabba and have him, Xizor, Guri and 4-lom chill together.  Jabba can’t be hit because of Xizor.  Xizor can’t be hit because of Guri.  There will then be 3 destinies in that battle.  Nasty little group holding on to Han.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about flipping.  That is just a trap to get you off of Cloud City.  Just stay there and drain. ‘</p>
