I"ØQ<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay, looking back after IÂ’m done writing this, this is a
<br />
long report. Settle down. Grab a beverage. All you
<br />
under-age guys, this does not mean IÂ’m encourage illegal
<br />
habits. Kick back, and enjoy. 
<br />
<br />
Intro? I heard that the St. Cloud tournament was drawing
<br />
Jon Swenson and Zach Stenerson from Moorhead and
<br />
Fargo, and I knew that Graham Neal and Mike Raveling
<br />
were going to attend from the Minneapolis / St. Paul area.
<br />
So the tournament was going to be top notch, drawing
<br />
several of the top 10 players in our region. I made plans
<br />
Tuesday, during the local 4-game tournament, with Mike
<br />
and Graham to hitch a ride out to St. Cloud and checked
<br />
back on Friday evening to confirm the plans. Once they
<br />
were solidified, I decided IÂ’d best change my decks since:
<br />
a) my light side was a pile of interrupts in the shape of a
<br />
very bad EBO deck and b) my light side was a pile of
<br />
interrupts in the shape of a very bad EBO deck.
<br />
Meanwhile, everyone and his grandma was playing Scum,
<br />
so I decided IÂ’d tear apart my Dark Side deck, too, which
<br />
was a Nikto brand of My Kind of Scum (donÂ’t mock the
<br />
Niktos, 4 power and 8 forfeit for 1 force as a react
<br />
anywhere at JabbaÂ’s Palace is pretty good). 
<br />
<br />
Fiddling around with Light Side cards and looking through
<br />
my collection, I decided that I really wanted to build a
<br />
deck using Off the Edge. But that didnÂ’t look too good, so
<br />
I built a Jedi Training to Test 6 deck. It stunk. I tore it
<br />
apart and built a Test to 3 w/docking bays and Off the
<br />
Edges deck. It stunk worse. I tore it apart and built a
<br />
TIGIH deck w/docking bays and Off the Edges. It smelled
<br />
slightly better, but still not pleasant. So, I decided I
<br />
wasnÂ’t good at building new decks, and slapped together
<br />
a Tosche Station deck, uncertain of my card mix. But it
<br />
was late and I was exhausted from my week of work and I
<br />
didnÂ’t really care about my Dark Side deck much yet
<br />
because I could build it in the car while we drove to St.
<br />
Cloud and I decided that sleep was good so I went to bed.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enter the morning. The snooze alarm was my friend for a
<br />
few taps, and I didnÂ’t have time to work on my decks
<br />
before I left to meet Graham and Mike at GrahamÂ’s
<br />
house. So I grabbed my collection of cards and drove off.
<br />
At GrahamÂ’s, it is made known to Mike and I that Herb
<br />
Macy will be joining us for the drive to St. Cloud (thatÂ’s a
<br />
different story). And Mike reveals that he canÂ’t drive his
<br />
new BMW because it still has its racing slicks, not winter
<br />
tires, and the roads are snow-covered and icy. So, weÂ’ll
<br />
take my car, but, fortunately, Mike volunteers to drive so I
<br />
can work on my decks. 
<br />
<br />
I decide to call my light side good enough and work on a
<br />
dark deck. I look at a couple of the purple cards and just
<br />
get this empty feeling all throughout me. Yes, I tell
<br />
myself, these cards are so overplayed that they have lost
<br />
all meaning. What have I left, then? I ask myself. Well,
<br />
self, my self replies, how about a JabbaÂ’s Palace
<br />
Manipulator? A light goes *DING* And I start fishing out
<br />
the cards that IÂ’ll need. I grab my Tatooine, Combat
<br />
Readiness and JabbaÂ’s Palace. ThatÂ’s a start. Then I
<br />
start fishing out all my 2/0 locations, Scanning Crews,
<br />
Senses, Alters, Myoom Onith, Ability x3, Search and
<br />
Destroy, Gailid, Monnoks--anything at all that I might use.
<br />
Of course, itÂ’s way more than 60 cards, so I start sleeving
<br />
cards, whittling away at the pile. Remember, now, that
<br />
this is being done in half of the backseat of my car. I am,
<br />
meanwhile, entertaining the other occupants with Lords of
<br />
Acid and Ramstein. So I get to the point, shortly before
<br />
we arrive at the campus where the tournament will be,
<br />
where I have 60 dark side cards in a deck, and IÂ’m happy.
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, my decks are: 
<br />
Light Side--Tosche Station and Mains 
<br />
Dark Side--JabbaÂ’s Palace Manipulator 
<br />
<br />
It turns out Swenson and Stenerson managed to corral a
<br />
few other Moorhead players. So, with the 4 of us from
<br />
Minneapolis, a few daring folk from Iowa, the Moorhead
<br />
crew, and the locals, the tournament is populated by a
<br />
very respectable 32 individuals. Dion Erbes, the TD, has a
<br />
cold and can barely speak, but everyone quiets down
<br />
enough that we can hear the pairings as they are called. 
<br />
<br />
(I apologize for names, here. I failed to take any notes. If
<br />
you played me, you know who you are. If you didnÂ’t play
<br />
me, youÂ’re just reading about the guys, 1-6, who did.) 
<br />
<br />
Game 1: My Dark vs. SteveÂ’s EBO X-wing Swarm 
<br />
<br />
As soon as I start shuffling, I realize that I didnÂ’t fit either
<br />
Battle Order or Imperial Decree into my deck, cards that
<br />
both would normally be included. Oh well, I figure that I
<br />
have two options against EBO. Either, IÂ’ll keep all his
<br />
pilots in his used pile with Screws while my early drains
<br />
and Search and Destroy will bleed his deck. OR, IÂ’ll
<br />
Monnok him for all of his X-Wings. So, we start out, and a
<br />
first turn Screw reveals 3 or so X-Wings and one rebel
<br />
who goes back to the used pile. Gailid goes to the
<br />
Audience Chamber where heÂ’ll sit the whole game. He
<br />
gets his sites and draws. I Screw him again next turn and
<br />
set up another drain, so IÂ’m getting a good early lead. But
<br />
his next turn he draws up way beyond Myoom range.
<br />
Something like 17 cards. No problem. IÂ’ve activated about
<br />
14 myself. I search for something and donÂ’t find a
<br />
Monnok, so I just draw, looking for the first Monnok I can
<br />
find. And I draw. And I draw. And I draw. And then my
<br />
force pile is gone, and I still have no Monnok in my hand.
<br />
My dark side manipulator deck canÂ’t manipulate. ItÂ’s a
<br />
pile. So Steve drops about 6 systems and as many
<br />
X-wings and says go. I drain for another 6 or so and hit
<br />
him with Search and Destroy. But thereÂ’s nothing I can do
<br />
about his drains, so he hits me for 18 or 22. And all I can
<br />
do the next turn is deploy Zuckuss and some dude in
<br />
space to block the drain at Kessel. That buys me maybe
<br />
one turn. But itÂ’s simply his huge drains versus my
<br />
modest drains and Search and Destroy. The game ends
<br />
in about 15 minutes. A full loss for me by 6. 
<br />
<br />
0(-6) 
<br />
<br />
So, after the game, I go hang out with Graham, Mike,
<br />
Jon, Zach and some of the other guys. Seems each of
<br />
them has won (until much later Shane comes back to
<br />
report a loss--to Herb Macy, but thatÂ’s another story). At
<br />
any rate, I realize now that I have a manipulator deck
<br />
without Monnoks, so I say, quite honestly, that I expect
<br />
to go 0-3 with my dark and hope that my light can go 3-0.
<br />
Everyone else finishes their games, and we re-pair. 
<br />
<br />
Game 2: My Light vs BrettÂ’s (?) BHBM 
<br />
<br />
This game was fairly embarassing. My opponent barely
<br />
knew his own cards. He started the game by announcing
<br />
each card he put into play and reading the full text. I
<br />
asked him if he was doing that for his benefit or for mine,
<br />
and when he said it was for mine, I asked him to stop. So
<br />
he did. But the game had that same sort of naive feel
<br />
throughout. With Mobilization Points out, he set the
<br />
Emperor up first turn at the Throne Room, losing 2
<br />
activation. He deployed The EmperorÂ’s Power but failed to
<br />
use it in two or three battles. Meanwhile, I deployed
<br />
Masta Luke first turn to Tosche Station from my reserve
<br />
deck (and he asked "How?"--so I said, "Using your
<br />
card."). And I activated a helluvalot on my second turn.
<br />
But Vader was quick to follow. We battled quite a bit and
<br />
danced around when the battling was looking bad for me.
<br />
I donÂ’t remember quite how I won, but a good deal of it
<br />
came from him losing cards from his reserve instead of
<br />
using VaderÂ’s forfeit value. I felt relieved when the game
<br />
was over. Full win by 27. 
<br />
<br />
2(+21) 
<br />
<br />
At this point, I know IÂ’m going to be among the top
<br />
players with a loss. And I hope to play my dark deck first,
<br />
so that my light side will have an easier game again.
<br />
Mike, Jon and I find an AD&amp;D video game that was kind of
<br />
fun for a while, well worth a quarter at any rate, and then
<br />
we head back for Game 3. 
<br />
<br />
Game 3: My Dark Side Misbegotten Jumble vs. ParkerÂ’s
<br />
EBO 
<br />
<br />
Well, he shows early signs of X-wing Swarm, so I set up
<br />
Gailid and Myoom again at two JabbaÂ’s sites. And my
<br />
early damage holds him back for quite a bit. Parker pulls
<br />
an interesting move and Revos the War Room, but for
<br />
some reason I had put Come Here You Big Coward in my
<br />
deck and, having drawn it, slap that down the succeeding
<br />
turn. So, it turns into extra generation for me and a
<br />
generation loss for him. Quite an important turn, too,
<br />
since my Screws hold him back a bit. He gets out Echo
<br />
Garrison... or whatever the effect is that lets him pull
<br />
Commander Luke, etc. But that only gets him one
<br />
character a turn while IÂ’m draining for 4 and working him
<br />
over with Search and Destroy. At one point, he begins his
<br />
turn searching for both his Echo sites and Commander
<br />
Luke. But I had a force saved and Screwed his Luke. That
<br />
was the highpoint of the game for me. Sad, but true.
<br />
Before he gets his EBO set up, he throws some ships
<br />
into space to start draining me. But Zuckuss and Boba
<br />
Fett launch into his ships at one system, and that gives
<br />
me another drain of 1 per turn. However, the next turn, I
<br />
Myoom and find that both Leia w/Gun and Tawss Khaa
<br />
are in his hand while I have Myoom and Gailid alone at
<br />
their sites on Tatooine. IÂ’m forced to land Zuckus with
<br />
Myoom and move Fett over to Gailid, but that seems to
<br />
hold Parker off. He keeps losing force to my drains and
<br />
Search and Destroy until very late in the game. And by
<br />
that time, Vader and Mara come down to Hoth to clean
<br />
up. Full win by 27. 
<br />
<br />
4(+48) 
<br />
<br />
Well, IÂ’m pleased as punch, having won with my dark
<br />
side. So I figure I may even go 4-2. And I trust my light
<br />
side to do its job.
<br />
<br />
Game 4: Tosche madness vs. Andrew Mahjowald (sp?)
<br />
RalOps
<br />
<br />
I played Andrew before in another tournament at St. Cloud,
<br />
and I know heâ€™s no pushover. I should beat him, but he
<br />
knows how to play his deck. When I look at my hand, though,
<br />
it seems to matter very little what heâ€™ll do. I draw a 2/0
<br />
site, Ben Kenobi and Luke w/Saber. First turn, he activates
<br />
deploys a site from reserve and draws. My turn, I deploy
<br />
Ben at the hut, my 2/0 site and move Ben to Tosche. He goes,
<br />
deploys another site from reserve and an Imperial Guard at
<br />
the Swamp. I activate 14 or 15, deploy Battle Plan, Frozen
<br />
Assets over his saved force, Luke w/Saber against the guard
<br />
and battle. He loses the guard and 5 or 6. So he activates
<br />
about 6 force on his turn and draws. I activate and draw,
<br />
too. His next turn, he deploys the Emperor at the spaceport
<br />
site that gives +1 power and forfeit to Imperial leaders.
<br />
Okay... Since he didnâ€™t start IAO. I deploy Frozen Assets to
<br />
shut off his force pile. Then, to Benâ€™s hut, I deploy Han
<br />
w/Gun, Leia w/Gun and Chewbacca. I Nabrun the 4 of them to
<br />
the Emperorâ€™s site and beat the tar out of the old man. At
<br />
this point, the game is effectively over no matter what 
<br />
Andrew chooses to do, so rather than forfeit Pasty and lose
<br />
only 15, he keeps the embodiment of evil on the table and
<br />
loses a good 24. I look at the cards in my hand and those on
<br />
the table and decide I donâ€™t need to draw another card for
<br />
the rest of the game. I just stop him from draining me at
<br />
all and block his drains with my armada. General Calrissian
<br />
in the Falcon deployed at his &lt;&gt; DB. And I took 2 force
<br />
loss from a battle involving the Emperor, Vader a bunch of
<br />
Imperial Guards, Trooper Assault and a Dark Jedi Presence.
<br />
But I never drew another card and paid for my drains to win
<br />
by 40. And now I think I can win this tournament if all the
<br />
undefeateds knock each other off--and I pull off a miracle
<br />
win with my dark side slop.
<br />
<br />
6(+88)
<br />
<br />
Well, not only do I know that I can potentially win this
<br />
tournament, but so does Jon Swenson who starts *accusing* me
<br />
of throwing the first game of each tournament. I mean,
<br />
really, can I help it if I suck at first games? Righteously
<br />
offended, I tell Jon that of coure Iâ€™m not trying to throw
<br />
my games, but he should go ahead and try to backdoor a
<br />
tournament sometime... BUT the real trick is to lose the
<br />
first TWO games. No one would EVER expect that!
<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I believe this is the intermission wherein the
<br />
inaugural Kohman Olympics took place. Josh Kohman was making
<br />
a loud noise of himself and Mike Raveling suggested that he
<br />
and Stenerson see who can throw Kohman further. So Mike
<br />
lifts Kohman and tosses him about 3 feet. Zach, not to be
<br />
outdone, tries a new technique and hurls Kohman headlong
<br />
into a chair. Maybe 4 feet, but Kohman disqualifies him for
<br />
brutality, still reeling from the new lump on his forehead.
<br />
Later events are much gentler, including the push-Kohman-on-
<br />
a-cafeteria-tray contest...
<br />
<br />
Well, the new pairings are favorable to me again. I play my
<br />
dark ahead of my light.
<br />
<br />
Game 5: My heap vs. Justin Fleenorâ€™s TIGIH
<br />
<br />
It had occured to me that I could play my dark deck like a
<br />
beat-down deck and just use Screws far more than I really
<br />
should. But Justin starts Do or Do Not AND Insight. And they
<br />
never leave the table. This means effectively half of my
<br />
deck is good for nothing other than destiny and easy choices
<br />
when it comes to losing force. But I draw a Lord Vader
<br />
early and deploy him to the Landing Platform. As soon as I
<br />
can (while Iâ€™m still force-choking Justin), I move Vader
<br />
to Chirpaâ€™s Hut and set up a drain of 2. Unfortunately, I
<br />
canâ€™t draw a character to save my life over the next 2 or 3
<br />
turns. Meanwhile, Justinâ€™s deploying 2/0 locations all over
<br />
the place and amassing a good handsize, and I canâ€™t take a 
<br />
peek with Screw. So Iâ€™m getting a bit worried when finally 
<br />
he launches the initial assault. 2 Eloms, Chewbacca and
<br />
Admiral Ackbar. Ackbar? What the? Anyhow, thatâ€™s who comes
<br />
to battle. Fortunately, I draw a high destiny, so Vader
<br />
covers all but 3 and the one to IFTC. I start setting up on
<br />
Tatooine with Mara and Saber, Mosep, Myoom, Dr. E and maybe
<br />
some other scrub. We exchange drains until I draw a Vader.
<br />
At this point, I have enough force to a) deploy Vader, b)
<br />
Elis Helrot and battle or c) do both if I draw a 0 for
<br />
Helrot. I search for a Jabbaâ€™s location and find in my 5
<br />
force: two 0â€™s, one 1, and two 3â€™s. Why not? I play Elis
<br />
on Mara and crew before deploying. 3. Bummer. So they head
<br />
over and just sit around. Choke Lord and Saber remain in
<br />
my hand. Justin brings Ackbar back from the Bacta Tank and
<br />
battles. I lose everyone but Mara. Stack another card on
<br />
IFTC. Iâ€™ve already seen the ASP droids, so I very much fear
<br />
stacking another card on IFTC, lest he get the Catapult
<br />
down and convert Vader. At this point my drains are keeping
<br />
me in the lead. But Maraâ€™s stuck against his big, bad crew,
<br />
holding Luke captive for 2 loss a turn unless Vader joins
<br />
her. And when has Vader ever shrunk from a battle? Vader
<br />
comes to the Landing Platform, saber in hand, and we battle.
<br />
I choke Chewbacca, hit two characters and win the battle by
<br />
1 power. Meanwhile, Iâ€™m immune, so both my characters stick
<br />
around while his are decimated. Next turn, all he can do is
<br />
run away. Itâ€™s pretty much a drain race from this point on,
<br />
except that I had managed to use Myoom once before she died
<br />
and saw an On the Edge or two in his hand. So I keep hold
<br />
of a couple of my Senses just to kill that card. Finally,
<br />
heâ€™s down to 10 life force or less and plays his On the
<br />
Edge. Sense. I succeed and lose the Sense + 2 more. But it
<br />
was the finishing blow, and I win by 21. The dark pile
<br />
*somehow* goes 2-1.
<br />
<br />
8(+109)
<br />
<br />
And so it turns out, history *does* repeat itself. Jon
<br />
Swenson lost to Grahamâ€™s Scum. Graham lost to somebody. Mike
<br />
Raveling lost to somebody. Stenerson lost to Josh Kohman.
<br />
All of the undefeated players have knocked each other out of
<br />
contention except for Josh Kohman, who has a timed win and
<br />
needs to win the game to win the tournament. Meanwhile, I
<br />
have (apart from Kohman) the largest differential by far, so
<br />
the winner of our game is going to be the winner of the
<br />
tournament.
<br />
<br />
Game 6: Battle of the Joshes, Grace vs. Kohman
<br />
<br />
My Tosche "Can I please play against Scum?" vs. Kohmanâ€™s
<br />
Scummy Court.
<br />
<br />
He starts Court. I start Obiâ€™s Hut, Careful Planning and
<br />
decide to convert his Audience Chamber. Of course, this is
<br />
much better than a Profit conversion because he doesnâ€™t get
<br />
to pull a CC Engineer with Chall. Not right away, anyhow.
<br />
He activates, loses one and draws. I activate deploy Ben
<br />
to the Hut, KFC to the Chamber and move Ben over. The rest
<br />
of the game is a prolonged battle over the audience chamber
<br />
with both First Strike and Draw Their Fire hitting the
<br />
table. Many men fought bravely in the hot Tatooine suns, and
<br />
many men died. Ben was disarmed and fatally wounded, only to
<br />
recover on a later turn. Master Luke was captured, only to
<br />
be freed and wreak havoc on unsuspecting aliens. But among
<br />
the many battles, the most memorable in my mind was a fairly
<br />
humours battle between Fett w/Blaster and Dr. E against my
<br />
Luke, Ben and Chewbacca. Kohman initiated this battle and
<br />
paid to retrieve (Aim High, people--Iâ€™ve been reading your
<br />
reports, and you let people retrieve for free... thatâ€™s like
<br />
*giving* them force...). He had earlier searched for
<br />
something to find a 3 and a 6 in his deck. Well, he plays
<br />
Hidden Weapons to target Luke, and the fateful destiny is...
<br />
3. Yes, Luke is captured (where was Kashyyk? Eh, Stenerson?)
<br />
and Ben gets hit by the 6 and is E-bait. Operated and dead.
<br />
Nonetheless, Chewbacca stands his ground with no destiny,
<br />
and since Kohman had exhausted his reserve deck, he gets no
<br />
destiny either. And Chewbacca outpowers the silly evil
<br />
aliens, so Kohman goes back into the force he retrieved and
<br />
loses one. As the suns were setting on Tatooine and
<br />
protracted battles, his Projected Telepathy gets grabbed,
<br />
General Cal and Nien Numb join the fray, Scum gets
<br />
cancelled, and finally the balance of powers tips
<br />
irrevocably in the favor of the light side. Win by 16.
<br />
<br />
So, yes, Jonâ€™s right. Iâ€™m a sneaky son of a gun, 
<br />
"backdooring" yet another tournament, coming from an early
<br />
loss to claim first with a total of 10(+125).
<br />
<br />
Zach Stenerson got second. Swenson took third. And I failed
<br />
to keep track beyond that point.
<br />
<br />
So, cheers and jeers abound:
<br />
<br />
Cheers:
<br />
Ben Kenobi. Do I need to say why?
<br />
Dion Erbes for running a smooth tournament, even while sick.
<br />
Players from Moorhead and Iowa for taking the drive.
<br />
The 31 players other than myself that made this a well-
<br />
attended tournament.
<br />
<br />
Jeers:
<br />
Monnok, oh Monnok, wherefore art thou, Monnok?
<br />
This is where all those "...but thatâ€™s a different story"
<br />
references come to bear...
