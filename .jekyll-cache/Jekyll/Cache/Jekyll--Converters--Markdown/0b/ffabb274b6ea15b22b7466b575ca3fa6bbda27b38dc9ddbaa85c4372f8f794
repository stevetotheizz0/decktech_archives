<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Okay. Last time I posted this deck, it was bashed
by those of you who did not read the strategy. Many
of you said Speeder Ops and Revo would destroy it,
and you were right. But I stated in the strategy
that the deck is easily modifiable to counter both
of those strategies, which are quite unpopular around
here. I have yet to play against Speeder Ops in
a tournament. But, to satisfy all of you critics, I
made the changes anyhoo.</p>

<p>Here we go
Set up in space ASAP. Draw for Wakeelmui and use
Twi-Lek for Reactor Terminal. Throw key doubles
back to avoid Grimtaash. Do not draw excessively.
If Luke or Ben hit the table early, draw for duel
initiators and wait until you have Focused Attack
before dropping Vader down to do his work. Also,
make some attempt to set up destinies if you have
half a brain. What about the Super Falcon you ask?
Overwhelmed is nice tech for the Super Falcon, as
it sends it home like its Elian Gonzalez. Also, I
have Dengar AND Lateral Damage to shaft the Falcon.
Surprising to many, I removed Well Guarded. The reasons
being are this Grimtaash is a seldom played card
these days, at least around here. Plus, I have Reactor
Terminal, which works well. And never draw a shltload of
cards into hand, or you will draw attention and be
Grimtaashed. But if you are absolutely paranoid, take
out whatever for it. I would suggest maybe a TIE or
whatever.</p>

<p>vs. Ops
Start Battle Order. Soon you will have ABCTTU set
up and when coupled with your retrieval, you
should have no problem winning the drain race.</p>

<p>vs. Mains
This is what the deck is meant to counter. Go for
the early duel. Drain in space and retrieve.
Versus Throne room, start Crush, and if you see SAC,
look for Dark Forces. A plethora of you suggested
I take DF out, but you all do not realize its tech
value. The ONLY way they will Sense or ALter a
damn thing is if they have Luke down and draw a
site. This is rather rare, and if Luke is down, I
will go duel the little brat.</p>

<p>vs. MWYHL
Drain, drain, and drain. If opponent trains Luke
instead of Daughter, take Vader down to Dagobah
and duel the little son of a Bltch.</p>

<p>vs. X-Wing Swarm
This is a tough match. Avoid the weapons and look to
catch him with his pants down and do the beatdown.
Visage will work wonders.</p>

<p>Cards thinking about adding</p>

<p>Big One - nice way to recycle TIEs and set up huge
retrieval engine.</p>

<p>4th EPP Vader - might get screwed on the drawâ€¦</p>

<p>Always Thinking With Your Stomach it can be plain
funny when you make Ben missing.</p>

<p>Frustration - anti-grabber tech for APTW, Twi-Lek,
etc.</p>

<p>EV-9D9 - to get Torture from reserve. If this dude goes, so
does Frustration.</p>

<p>Damn Iâ€™m tired of typingâ€¦	â€˜</p>
