I"<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Aloha from Hawaii!  Well, not really, Iâ€™m actualy from Seattle, but with this cold weather, I wish it were Hawaii.  Iâ€™m here today to tell a little tale about a trip I took to Phoenix.  
<br />
<br />
I found out that I was going to be able to go to Phoenix a whole 8 days before the tourny was to be played, thus sneaking in just in time for cheap airline tickets.  So, I fly into Phoenix Friday night, and am picked up at the airport by my good friend George, and he drops me off at my grandparents house.  I then call Chris Shaner, and ask if he can still give me a ride down to Tempe.  Chris says, "Yeah, if you want to ride with Roach."  Iâ€™m like "thatâ€™s cool."
<br />
<br />
Okay, so itâ€™s now 2:00 in the morning, and I look at my decks.  My Lightside is my hidden base operative deck, that Iâ€™ve been tweeking for the last 2 weeks, and itâ€™s set.  For DS, I have "Harvilla Huntdown", "Sagan TIEâ€™s" and "Hawkins Branus" built.  I decide on Hunt, as itâ€™s the most solid I have, and it is just a good deck.
<br />
<br />
So itâ€™s now 3:00, and I go to sleep:
<br />
<br />
6:45 A.M.:
<br />
I wake up, get a bite to eat, get dressed, brush teeth, then I throw up!  WTF is up with that.  so I brush my teath again, drink water to settle the stomach, and scarf down more food... I see Chris pull up, so out the door I go, hugging my grandma goodbye, and am on my way to Tempe.
<br />
<br />
We roll into the card shop, and Iâ€™m just exstatic at all the faces I get to see.  Alot of people I used to play against, a few others that happend to be in town, and then others along the lines of Clint, Steve, Brian, Kyle, etc.  Awsome.
<br />
<br />
So, Iâ€™m there, making some trades, talking smack with Girard and others, and we start about 10, an hour late (note to Girard:  Any tourny that starts before noon is considered on time to me).  So pairing are getting called out, and I here my name announced, against some other guy named Clint Hays.  Hmm, this should prove to be entertaining.
<br />
<br />
Game 1:  DS vs. Clint Haysâ€™ Agents Speeders
<br />
Well, were do I begin?  I shall first say that I have never once played against a speeder deck, so I have no idea really what is coming.  I understand the beatdown, can visulize the beatdown, but for some reason, the data just does not compute.  I play the waiting game this game, and realize that was the mistake.  I gave Clint way to much time to set his hand up, and let him deploy two Manuevering Flaps (itâ€™s not unique, check it out) which detroys my chance at Alter.  so, I make a move, deploy Vader/Tarkin, and pick up some... well, I got hit for 40 power to my 10.  Wow.  (note, I verified his deck, and there were only 7 speeders there, apperently the other 8 or so were in his hand)  So, that spanking hurt, but I took it.  After that, the game was pretty uneventful, and I lost by 16.  But hey, I didnâ€™t know how to play against Speeders.
<br />
FL 0 (-16)
<br />
<br />
Game 2: LS vs. John Baril Hoth clouds deck.
<br />
Well ,John was slow getting moving, and my deck played out just perfect, setting up Operative drains on some planets, and controlling space and killing his bonuses with menace fades and cancellation.  He complains a bit that he never got his clouds going, and I just smile and nod while staring at the X-wing cannon in hand and starfighter to use them on.  Win by 8
<br />
2 (-8)
<br />
<br />
Game 3: LS vs. Wyatt Evertt Endor speeder mike drains
<br />
He getâ€™s a great quick jump, and I lose a few force, but I get my operatives and space going, menace fades to kill his drains and get the huge operative/Space drain going.  He spreads on Endor, but Jedi Luke pays avisist.  FW by 15
<br />
4 (+7)
<br />
<br />
Game 4: DS vs. Joel Massie LS.
<br />
Holy Crap, I canâ€™t remember this game!.  I won, but I canâ€™t remember what he played!  FW by 11
<br />
6 (+18)
<br />
<br />
Game 5: DS vs. Matt Rader throne room
<br />
This was a difficult came to play, and since I figured he had no BGâ€™s, I deploy my DS docking bay only, to force the issue there.  Well, with the power at the deatstar, and Sarki and Mara at the Throne room, I won the grueling contest.  Game ended with a 4 turn standoff of Vader Tarkin vs. Jedi Luke and EPP Han.  Carida Drain win it. I won by 11
<br />
8 (+29)
<br />
<br />
Game 6:  LS Vs. Shane Watner DS TIEâ€™s 
<br />
He Starts Throne room, and mob points.  oh, a TIE deck, fun.  I know I have to play my deck, not against his, so I follow this simple plan.  *Get systems out, get operatives in speeders to such systems, have space power, kill his bonuses, and cancel some drains if needed*  Average win by about 8.  Well, I won this game by 5...  most likely my deck was mostly on table  good game nonetheless
<br />
10 (+34)
<br />
<br />
Game 7:  LS vs. Steven Lewis Huntdown
<br />
Well well, I get to play Clint and Steve.  That is too cool, I know now that my ticket was worth it to come down.  Well, I trans Term Steve turn 1, but heâ€™s got a holonet trans for me, darn.  Well, Iâ€™m slow getting stuff in my hand, and over the course of 2 turns, I lose Kiffex, and 3 operatives from my deck... darn, there goes my major damage.  I canâ€™t stop the visage, and Iâ€™ve lost the major damage inflictors I have.  but I can still win... the key card you ask?  Boussh.  I get boussh out, and she lives a turn, but the next, Steve plays Sniper.  It goes through.  Darn.  Now to tell you the bad part.  theres this card call "itâ€™s a trap".  I play two of them.  It cancels Sniper.  I had one in my hand.  oh well.  That causes me to flip, which engages security precautions.  which in turn make me lose alot of force. I played dumb, I coulda won it out, but instead, I lost the noble fight by 11
<br />
10 (+23)
<br />
<br />
Game 8:  Ds vs. Steven Lewis Speeders
<br />
WTF?  I have to play Steve?  wow, DS really dominated that earlier round.  so I show hunt, he shows speeders.  Well, I decidee to take a new approach this game.  I have a vader in my hand, and I drop him to tatooine, ignoring my own DBâ€™s, cause Iâ€™m not giving him anywhere to run.  so Vader is soon backued up, and then I get Sarkli, Emperor and Janus to the hoth Warrroom.  My Strategy?  Jump on the speeders sites so fast and furious, and cause as much force loss as possible.  I found out that it works...  I end up winning by 13, causing a total of 8 in drains and Visage in the end game...  to his 3... not enough, great game, I beat Steve.  Win by 13
<br />
12 (+35)
<br />
<br />
Okay, so I go 6-2, my two losses being to Clint and Steve, I canâ€™t complain about that at all.  I come in 10th, last of the 6-2â€™s
