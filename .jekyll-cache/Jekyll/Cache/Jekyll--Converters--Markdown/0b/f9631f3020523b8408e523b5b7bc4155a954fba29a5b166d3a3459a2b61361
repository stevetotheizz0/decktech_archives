<p><strong>**Type II, so no gay one star reviews cuz I dont have a Vader</strong>**</p>

<p><strong>Response to Reviewers</strong></p>

<p>Look, I know that it is unoriginal, but arent all Type II Senate decks essentially the same? You dont have to much flexibility with 205 cards (or so). Also, I didnt want to do that Manip bull.</p>

<p>Oops Looks like I made a typo. So sorry guys. Change WMAOP to Nemodian Advisor.</p>

<hr />

<p>Okay, Ive had this deck for quite a while now, so when I heard about the free 100 points I was like, Score So I posted it. (Otherwise you wouldnt be reading this) Anyway, podracing works like this Set up Lotti at the Senate Shack and start doing the Tunnel Vision deal until you grab everything. The interrupts are in there in case people start to wise up and keep their Pod in hand or in case they start pods (highly likely).</p>

<p>This deck should flip first or second turn. There are, what, eleven senators plus two squabbling delegates? I mean, you have to be like eight years old not to flip first or second turn. Against non-senate decks youll probably want a guard, trent Lott christopher Dodd, and two other senators chillin. Against that totally unfeasible deck (LS Senate) youll want some more and you should try and kill their senators with your interrupts. Porn Free Ta is amazing with his 6 destiny.</p>

<p>You should use your power characters wisely and go for choice beatdowns with a lot of potential force loss. P-59 is a BEAST. Maul will be used very effectively in Type II. Using Rune Haako and that other senator (forgot his name) your opponent will NOT draw a battle destiny for any battle. Really.</p>

<p>Wait to use SquabDelegates until you have many Senators out. That plus pods is huge. UhhhhIm trying to think what else to say. There isnt much, really. On to your questions</p>

<hr />

<p>Why no Wattos Box?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> In case your opponent actually beats you. Its a little risky, and I dont like risks.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why no Sense?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  In Closed Environment, there are no important interrupts so hence, it took up room.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why no more Nemodians?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  I dont like them. Lott and Rune are the only ones good enough for this deck. ;)
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<p>Okay, thats enough with questions, theyre starting to piss me off. Matchups.</p>

<p>Whoa, there are a lot of these. HurHa</p>

<p>Hyperdrive Drop down Maul (Tat) and destroy them.</p>

<p>Senate Control the Senate with your interrupts and superior senators. Always pay for Palpatine. Also, for @#$%head senators kill them with Black Man.</p>

<hr />

<p>Be sure to read the cards. My first game with this deck took forever cuz I had to read all the texts.</p>

<p>Thanks for looking,</p>
