<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>This is your classic ghetto style BHBM.  It is primarily a reactive deck that goes and well battles.  It plays the same against most decks; let them deploy first then go kick the crap out of them.  Huge destiny, power characters equals big battle damage.  Start first strike to give some retrieval, make opponent lose one, and then make him stack one when he loses the battle.  There isn?t really much to this deck, I?ve been playing it since Comic-Con last year, and will be retiring it.  It seems to deploy way too much for what it?s worth.  I?ll probably be switching to Hunt Down, and just thought I?d put the deck before retiring it.</p>

<p>Match-ups All the friggin same.  Let them deploy something, then go kick the pants off of em.</p>

<p>Card choices</p>

<p>IG in 2000 ? It?s a great and overlooked ship.  It?s just as good as Bossk, except it doesn?t cost nearly as much, but has just one less forfeit.  Why is Bossk?s forfeit so small?</p>

<p>2 Senses, 1 Combo ? Sometimes I want to be able to cancel reacts, sometimes I want to recycle my hand.  Now I?ve got my choice J Yay</p>

<p>1 Maul Strikes vs. 2 I Have You Now?s ? I used to run 2 Maul Strikes because he could pull sabers, well I noticed I don?t really play with sabers, so I switched to 2 I Have You Now?s.</p>

<p>This deck works great except it has to deploy and lose way to much to win.  I can get around 20 differential with it, but Hunt Down will do much better and still do the same thing.  I?ll just have to run a few more I Have You Now?s, Maul Strikes, and TPM?s.</p>

<p>LMK what ya think of the good ole BHBM.</p>
