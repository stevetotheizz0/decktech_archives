<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Your basic profit deck, except i use alien han and keep him at the audience chamber so he canâ€™t be battled or die.  and you force drain with eloms with tessek, cancel drains with bargaining table, and give profit damage with mains.  If they stay at the audience chamber and wonâ€™t move put out order to engage and theyâ€™ll move fast.  keep han at the ac and everything will work out fine.â€™</p>
