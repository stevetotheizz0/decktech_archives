<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>type 11 version of my lord is it legal.</p>

<p>it has the ability to win the podrace- lott dod gets cards from force pile.</p>

<p>we must accelerate our plans gets podracer collision and blockade flagship bridge for activation.</p>

<p>you put maul down to landing site hopefully first turn and start setting up with characters like sing and the droids. if they play hyperdrive try to go down with maul and other charcters, play maul strikes and put a senator there and add a battle destiny with no civility only politics.</p>

<p>you can retrieve with the marketplace and obviously the podrace. you`ve got senses for the step backward or the allegations of corruption which ever comes out.</p>

<p>hopefully flip fist turn-you<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ve got 2 squabbling delegates to make it easier and you get to retrieve 6 force when you</code>ve got senators there.</p>

<p>the 22 card swing and the drains from tatooine and the senate and the battles you get to win will prove too much for the opponent.</p>

<p>you`ve got quite a lot of high destiny cards in the deck, should make podrace easier.</p>

<p>thank you for reading ‘</p>
