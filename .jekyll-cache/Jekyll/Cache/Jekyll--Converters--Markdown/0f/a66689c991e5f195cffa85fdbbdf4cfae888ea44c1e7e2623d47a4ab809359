<p>’</p>

<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>1st turn-	You should have drawn a Lift Tube Escape or 2. Use Strike</p>

<p>Planning to pull General Calrissian.Pull a Lift Tube from reserve with LTE.</p>

<p>Deploy a DB with Insurrection. Also deploy Cloud City from reserve with</p>

<p>the objective. If you have any pilots use Squad Assignments and take over</p>

<p>Cloud City.</p>

<p>2nd turn- Same as last turn except flip your objective if possible. Get</p>

<p>Puccimir Thryss and DODNT/WA out ASAP. Also get out the Admirals</p>

<p>Order. If everything is done right you can drain for 12 with 4 sites. Drain of</p>

<p>3 a site and because of the objective my drains are uncancelable and can</p>

<p>not be modified. Rops and ISB can’t minus my drains now.</p>

<p>If they ever try and battle just use Lift Tube Escape to get away.</p>

<p>Now for the matchups-</p>

<p>JP- This includes MKOS and Court. Just stay on CC and drain drain drain</p>

<p>along with running around. Never ever get caught. This can be hard or</p>

<p>easy. It all depends on how you play.</p>

<p>Hunt Down- Same as JP</p>

<p>BHBM- Give them Luke. Drain drain drain.</p>

<p>ISB- Drain Drain Drain, Run Away</p>

<p>RalOps- Drain Drain Drain, Run Away</p>

<p>If you play smart you can get your drains going in 2 turns and flip in 1. Just</p>

<p>play smart and you should win.</p>
