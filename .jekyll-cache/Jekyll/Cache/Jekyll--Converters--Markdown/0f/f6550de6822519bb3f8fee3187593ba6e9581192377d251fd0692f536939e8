<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Ok this deck is exparimental and has won we all my games so far.</p>

<p>First tunt grab Shocking info and plat it every turn and grab it every turn so you have a 5 always at the bottem of your deck if you want to track it ever in the game.</p>

<p>well first off you want to get xizer to a battle ground and so you grab the 2 docking bays.</p>

<p>When he is there give him a body gaurd and look for a jabbas palce and throw down a scum on it.</p>

<p>Since all you cards all alians this is great</p>

<p>the rest of the game is just battle and deploy.</p>

<p>The Makurths are in there for the surprise.lol and the retreival. With Nigth time conditoins out they get insane</p>

<p>But the mane part of this deck is skum. I wanted this deck to be like MKOS but with a twist and i think i have done it</p>

<p>Thank you for reading the deck. I HOPE YOU LIKE IT â€˜</p>
