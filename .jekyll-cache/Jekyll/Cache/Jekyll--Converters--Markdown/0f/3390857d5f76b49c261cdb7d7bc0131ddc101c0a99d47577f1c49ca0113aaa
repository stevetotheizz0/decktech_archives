<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>I start S&amp;V because I have 2 copies of All Wrapped Up (It also gives me a boost from the beginning) Start All Wrapped Up against Throne Room, cause they can cancel it on the first turn.
Oo-ta Goo-ta Solo? capture those nabruning mains.
Endor Occupation stop the opponent from celebrating
Hutt Smooch capture Boussh, TK-422, or Artoo w/ A Gift
Hidden Weapons a way of capturing/killing characters
Elis Helrot if your opponent is on another planet.
Twi’lek Advisor Get out those effects faster
Ghhhk in case if you’re ever super-outpowered, helps vs. EPP beatdown crews
Bad Feeling Have I makes it harder for them to get a beatdown crew
First Strike use with S&amp;V-another retrieval engine
All Wrapped Up A must for this deck
Resistence I hate inserts
Skiff to protect your characters from the Sarlacc
Bubo keep people where you need them, eat spies
ZiMH you only have 6 ability? what a pity
Bossk In Bus one extra destiny
BFiS1 Immunity to attrition and a battle destiny.
DiP1 No immunity for you
Bossk w/ Gun capture time
Iggy w/ Gun see above
Mosep Help with drains
Ephant keep spies out of the audience chamber
Bane Malar scan Chewie
4-LOM w/ gun cancel game text )
Salacious Crumb  Hes awesome	makes all 1s, 3s, 5s, and 7s opponent draws for destiny lost
Suicide Vader kill an annoying opponents character quickly
Docking Bays work with the objective.
Tatooine+Occupation = fun
Oppressive Enforcement Good against Sense/Alter
Reactor Terminalbigger differential when you win
SHUOSHD  Bacta Tank can get very annoying</p>

<p>vs. Profit start Mara and Chall. Use Chall to pull CCEngineer, convert their AC, then pull an alien of your choice
vs. Hidden Base probe w/ the ships.
vs. MWYHLforce drain the heck out of them
vs. Yavin 4 choke just stay on planet, let them come to you.  Start All Wrapped Up instead of S&amp;V.
vs. Ops try to set up Occupation while beating them up.</p>

<p>That’s all the types I’ve seen at tourneys around here, I think.
If you tell me what to put in, tell me what to take out in its place
Thanx,
—Carson
