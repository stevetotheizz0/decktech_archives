<p>Strategy: ‚Äò</p>

<p>*First note-this is a revision on my deck, ‚ÄúFoo on tracking Hunt Down‚Äù</p>

<p>As stated before this deck should hold up well against a host of LS decks.  It battles and drains well and has the means to take out many types of decks.</p>

<p>Against‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Training  Game over.  That deck is too powerful for it‚Äôs own good when completed, but if it can‚Äôt train‚Ä¶  Start with Broken Concentration.  As fast as you can get out He Is Not Ready, using Twi‚Äôlek if you have to.  If you have gotten it fast enough, even DoS with every adder on her and an At Peace can only pass the first test.	After that the math is just not in her favor.  At that point, you have two choices.  You can simply refuse to play a Vader, don‚Äôt flip, and HINR and BC can‚Äôt be altered, he can‚Äôt test, you lose force, but he loses more from the drains with all the PotF and Expand, and you There‚Äôll be Hell to Pay his It Could Be Worse.  Heck, if he cancels Visage, even better for you.  Choice two; deploy Vader, hope the effects will slow him down, he has trouble altering Broken, and whenever you need to, Omni Box his ass.</p>

<p>Hidden Base Start with the normal stuff, since you don‚Äôt need security precautions right away.  Get Decree working, then protect either Kessel or Coruscant with Executor after Precautions are out, then go probing with Fett and/or Bossk.	You should win the drain race.</p>

<p>Ops Imperial Decree/Visage/PotF/Expand.  You win drain race.</p>

<p>EBO  Throws a monkey wrench at you, but gives you a battle ground right away.	Take out the power generators with Vader on an AT AT, and that would be a lot of fun.  Even if not, move in, Control Def Perim and one other, and Decree is still good.</p>

<p>Any Other  It battles and drains well.  Should take care of itself.  Use the cards as they should be used, or even if they have another use.  Trap a character with he is not ready, give yourself better generation with Precautions, Drain like mad with all of PotF/Expand/Emperor/Janus Grejatus/Sabers, and don‚Äôt let them stack destiny using Omni Box. The Force is with you‚Ä¶‚Äô</p>
