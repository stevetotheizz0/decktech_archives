<p>I will give you the strategy for the numbers and stuff.  For any things about the swarm part.  It’s a basic X-wing swarm.  View my X-wing hive deck (4 and 1/2 star) for more details on how to play the swarm part.</p>

<p>This deck is played like a swarm except for the numbers.  What you do is deploy the Droids and Luke as Passengers on ships.  Exceptions being deploy Artoo+A Gift against Scum and LS, JK against BHBM. One hint is, don’t flip until you need the drains. If they play S&amp;D, they likely won’t play No Escape so Honor can save you for a couple of turns, unless it’s a HD deck in which case you cancel the Visage ASAP.  Your characters all have a destiny of 4 or higher so you whip with the numbers.  If they play YCHF, they probably ditch it for Sec. Prec. or something fairly soon.  Then you go to work.  I play BG-J38 because he makes my PoaSs destiny SEVEN in battle. I can’t really anything more about this deck.   Remember, you can win without the numbers.  They are just an bonus of sorts.</p>

<p>This deck is very simple to play and won’t give up without a fight.  The best part is, NO ONE SEES IT COMING  D-mail me with any questions.    ‘</p>
