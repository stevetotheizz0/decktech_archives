<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>This deck is a force containment deck. The theory being to slow their activation while you beat them down. Tried to be balanced with everything. Small SA package with Wise Advise for backup. All useful interrupts and effects. Oola and Harc for control of the game. Wedge and Harc for pilot backup. The rest of the characters for winning battles. Chirpaâ€™s Hut to help cancel Ominous Rumors if I have to. Yodaâ€™s Hut and Rendevous Point are â€˜safeâ€™ twix sites. â€˜</p>
