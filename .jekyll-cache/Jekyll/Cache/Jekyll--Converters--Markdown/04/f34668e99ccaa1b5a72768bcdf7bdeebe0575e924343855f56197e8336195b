Ralitiir Operations/In The Hands Of The Empire

<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Pretty easy to play.  Start RallOps, Ralitiir and Twiâ€™lek for IAO.  IAO isnâ€™t vital, and thatâ€™s for good reason.  It can be easily changed to counter your opponent.  Against Hidden Base, start Security Precautions.	Against MWYHL, start Broken Concentration.  Against ops, start Battle Order.  Against Mains and Toys, I would just leave it at IAO, so if the beatdown comes, all your guys arent wiped out ).  Try to grab the forest first to keep your guys alive.	Then just drop like crazy until the objective is flipped.  Stick low ability guys in the walkers so they donâ€™t get chopped up or shot.  The DS brothers are made for the walkers.  Non-unique walkers are power 9  Once you have plenty of ability at all your sites, turn toward the skies.	Watch out if your opponent has clouds, they can flip it back in a snap if youre not careful.  Use the battle destiny benifits to drain and battle in space, supplemening with steady drains on the ground.  If your opponent does not come after you, DO NOT chase after him.  Your guys are for Ralitiir.  If you do, your opponent will drop some guys and flip your objective back, and then youâ€™re in deep trouble.  Keep the Executor at Ralitiir so Light doesnt take it.  Torture for numbers, Twiâ€™lek for your effects.  Not to difficult to play, just Donâ€™t Get Cocky P.	Comments and Suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks   â€˜</p>
