<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>With this deck, the main theme is to sit back and drain with Tessek via the non unique aliens.
Elom-good destiny, good against imp decks
Talz-OK destiny, good for keeping mains alive
Hâ€™nemthe-helps keep opponents deploy at a maximum
Gran-retrieves force</p>

<p>A Gift-good against those pesky COTVG / ISEWYD bounty hunting decks w/ aliens
I Must Be Allowed to Speak-makes Luke Immune to attrition, deployment restictions for SOS are ignored
Starships-
   a)tell me if you think I should take out part of the fleet, I really do think I need more red cards, but Iâ€™m not sure.  Just want other opinions
   b)weapons-fire quad laser at big ship, if misses, fire intruder missle for +3 destiny.  Quad lsr has destiny 4, Intruder missles have destiny 7</p>

<p>If opponent starts with the EJP objective, start with Dune Sea for destiny draw protection or the Wastes for +1 drain.	If anyone thinks I should do other wise, please tell me
Arc Welder has <em>good</em> destiny and is useful against Bounty hunting decks
I have R2-D2 in there b/c I donâ€™t have another Artoo and for backup A Gift usage just in case Artoo is lost in a force drain or somthing.</p>

<p>I know I need more red in my deck, but Iâ€™m working on it
The Larsâ€™s-good for forfeiting, and adding power to Luke
Arleil Schous-helps get out aliens</p>

<p>Donâ€™t give this deck a bad rating because you donâ€™t know what a card does.  If you donâ€™t know, you can always look it up at Decipher.com
All <em>constructive</em> criticism is welcome
