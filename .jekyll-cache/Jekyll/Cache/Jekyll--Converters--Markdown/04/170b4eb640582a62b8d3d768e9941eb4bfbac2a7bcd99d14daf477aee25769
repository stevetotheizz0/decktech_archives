<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Just realized I left out a card-Echo Base Docking Bay</p>

<p>Iâ€™m starting with MWYHL for SAC protection and activation, not to mention the Yoda/Yodaâ€™s Hut combo.
Insurrection is to boost 14 charactersâ€™ forfeit and to prevent Elis beatdowns, along with getting out all the docking bays.
All of the non-insurrection characters can draw battle destinies by themselves.
The Ithorian is in there for force drain bonuses at Endor.
Skiffs are for landspeed and reacting
Now that I think of it, Nabrun isnâ€™t very useful
Quite A Mercinary is if I donâ€™t want their beatdown crew coming over
Iâ€™ll put another Noble Sacrifice into my deck when I get one, theyâ€™re especially good with Insurrection
So is Mantellian Savrip
Scramble is good against many decks
Ultimatum vs. Inserts</p>

<p>Please be constructive in your reviews.
Thanx
