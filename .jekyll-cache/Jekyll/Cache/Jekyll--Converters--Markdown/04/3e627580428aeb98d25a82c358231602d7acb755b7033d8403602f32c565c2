<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>update again  Iâ€™m not playing Capâ€™n Soloâ€™s because Hanâ€™s too much of a pimp on the ground.  Lando with any pilot is good enough.  1 destiny, 8 power, immune &lt; 7 (with my ao)</p>

<p>I think the capability to od the one-turn on the ground is more important, for a couple of reasons.  Fisrt I donâ€™t forsee too much air at the next tournement I go to.  (and all I need to hold is Kessel)</p>

<p>Second I have been able to beat ISB space with just the air I have (so I have enough)  Also, I donâ€™t like the card inefficiency (two cards vs. one)</p>

<p>This deck isnâ€™t made to do the (euro) one-turn in the air.</p>

<p>Ummmâ€¦ update I wanted feedback, not people saying â€™I need some tight puss.y.â€™  Thanks Brad, but Iâ€™m ignoring your feedback, because I like Lando in Falcon â€™cuz Iâ€™m not playing Capâ€™n Solos.  I also canâ€™t fit in an â€™artoo and threepioâ€™, but i wouldnâ€™t mind one and a â€™were you lookinâ€™ for me.â€™</p>

<p>If someone can tell me why this loses to another deck I BUILT (AOBS) then iâ€™ll be happy.  and if you wanna see the aobs, check out my page.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</p>

<p>Oh yea, A Place for My Head is a Linkin Park song, but itâ€™s not as well-known as some other jank by themâ€¦  Itâ€™s one of my favoritesâ€¦</p>

<p>First off, there is a negative chance Iâ€™ll lose the race.  â€™A Step Backwardsâ€™ is the most Godly card for the ls in podracing.  This is the reason Sebulba is good because ONE of his destiny is sometimes better than TWO of my destiny.  BUT if the top destiny is pulled from each side, the light side still has a destiny left  This can do many things Nullify Sebulbaâ€™s Cheating, And it can be played when youâ€™ve got a low card on top (thatâ€™s less than 3) so then you lose trash, and Sebulba loses a (3+destiny)</p>

<p>NOT ONLY THAT but All that AND â€™Too Close for Comfortâ€™ can be played from lost pile.  Oh yea, and my favorite bit of juicy podracing teck is the bay.  You can pull the bay, track a six.  Then control it, and lose a high-destiny card as the last drain, and replace it with your top race destiny.  If they comedown, remember to play â€™Entering the Areaâ€™ AGAIN to add a destiny, and you get one for smugglers, and thatâ€™s a lot of destiny, and if you can trackâ€¦ thatâ€™s good. (ie. 6-5-5)</p>

<p>In the beginning of the game, keep in mind that holding to locations will win you the game Cantina and Kessel.  Thatâ€™s a drain of 5, no modifiers, they pay to drain, putting bottom card of lost pile on force pile, etc.</p>

<p>In the beginning i sometimes hold the bay, and move to the Cantina later.  Kessel is a must 1st or 2nd turn. (of course, you want to play the game, not always my strategyâ€¦)</p>

<p>Then youâ€™ll retreive 6, and they will lose six.  Then youâ€™ll retreive four, and they wonâ€™t want to save force.  If you set up quickly, you be â€™retreivingâ€™ one every control phase. (Celebration isnâ€™t in here because i never hold tatooine, only Kessel, and Endor Occupation can bury it)</p>

<p>By now, you can drop places with remaining smugglers.  You can do that tripler/one turn thing if you want to.  You can usually play it 3 times 2wice from hand, and once from pile.  Life Debt is cool, Han+Chewie=4 destiny.  The destiny in this deck is pretty good, and easy to trackâ€¦  Whenever you have less power than them use the tripler, cause you get multiple destinies, and also theyâ€™re good.</p>

<p>In my area people have stopped teching against WYS, so if they do in yours, donâ€™t give a bad rating because of that.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve found that I can beat lots of decks, but I consistantly lose to the deck I built for my little brother. (AOBS) Itâ€™s called Why I Canâ€™t go to Big Tournementsâ€™</p>

<p>Oh yea, Matchups  Play your own game, then go after them when your set up and you can pull of two tracked destinyâ€¦</p>

<p>Iâ€™m thinking about playing this deck at the team tourney at Mirk in Mn, but I dunnno, and I need more feedback.  Oh yea, and Me and S. Banwell (IA States winner) need one more player, d-mail me if you wanna go. Or e-mail me (kjedi@juno.com)     â€˜</p>
