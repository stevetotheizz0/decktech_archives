<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>This deck is all around good.  Use the EPPs to combat on the ground, but save EPP Han if you think General Solo would be better on the Falcon.</p>

<p>Vs. Ops start Battle Plan and use the EPPs to disrupt ‘em. Outdraining them shouldn’t be too hard.  TPTIFF will also help quite a bit.</p>

<p>Vs. Hunt Down stay in space and annihilate their puny resistance with a swarm.	It can easily take out a deck in one swarm.</p>

<p>Vs. Manipulation Battle them and drain as much as possible in space  It probably should have more protection, but I’ve beaten most manip decks with this deck.  Use Antilles for a CCT deck.’</p>
