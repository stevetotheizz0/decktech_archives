<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Basic - Simple stuff. Deploy buddy , deploy Op.
Get them in AT-STs ASAP. This deck has a ton of
Battling ability so donâ€™t be afraid if they come
after you. Once the EPPs are down you can spread ,
drain , and win. Battle Plan doesnâ€™t do jack since
this deck has a lot of Blue to go into space
On to specs</p>

<p>Y4 Revo ,etc - Start Corulag and the Desert. The
ability to pull out sites really hurts this deck
type and as long as you absorb the initial blow you
win.</p>

<p>HB- With copies of Coruscant and Kessel normal HBs
can for a total of 2 ( 1 at Kessel and 1 at Kiffex )
so you donâ€™t even have to probe ; This is why I
like this deck â€“ I hate having to probe for HB.</p>

<p>MWYHL- Great Warrior kinda sucks but the ability
to drain for about 7-8 or so will still win the
game.</p>

<p>Ops - Start BOrder. There is a copy of both applicable
ABC targets and youâ€™ll get the lockdown on them.
Vader and Tarkin can stampede and cause damage on
their planet.</p>

<p>Wrap up - That is pretty much it. Wuher takes care
of A Gift and you can pretty much beat anything else.
You might wanna throw in a Point Man or two if
Order to Engage is popular in your area because that
is pretty much the only way this deck can lose â€“
or you can throw in a First Strike so that when you
battle you can also retrieve more. Good luck with it.</p>
