I"°<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I went to RIW (gathering place of the Michigan Elite) and got beat by a girl. Not directly but over all. And boy did I deserve it. As I will detail later you should always LOOK at your hand at some point during your turn. This is very helpful. 
<br />
<br />
I wasnâ€™t suprised by the turnout at RIW (36 player)and very happy to see women playing the game. This means we all may not be such geeks after all ? I will be back to avenge my poooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrr performance next Friday so beware.

Now on to the dissing:
<br />
<br />
Game 1: My Senate (1799) vs. My friend Carlâ€™s Blow the Bunker (1600â€™s)
<br />
<br />
I have played Carlâ€™s deck like 3,000,000 times. I also drove with Carl. I have made love to ..... ah never mind. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well lets just say this wasnâ€™t a good test to see if I had returned to chump form or not. As Iâ€™ve said before: 
<br />
I dunno. Probably because I thought wow Iâ€™m really good. Iâ€™m the man. Everyone should bow to me.

Game 2: My WYS vs. Paul Prong MKOS (1700â€™s)
<br />
<br />
His rep was Zuckuss. So I knew he wasnâ€™t flipping anytime soon. Which meant an easy game just got simple. Now knowing Paul is Clintâ€™ s brother I decided that I should go easy on him. MISTAKE. This guy can play. Heâ€™s pretty good. 
<br />
<br />
My opening hand was awesome. Naked 3-PO, and a whole lotta red. NO CTV though. On turn one he searches for Jabbaâ€™s Palace Siteâ€™s and Drops AC out of hand. Then gets a DB and the Executor. On turn two he was activating like 30 force or something. So I drop 3-PO grab Kessell use 3-PO with Kessell. Then draw. I now have EPP Luke, Outrider, Talon, Wedge, Mirax, EPP Han, CTV and a whole lotta red. He drops Maul to the Cantina gets more sites, plays Weapon Lev. For nothing and says go. I calculate his force way more than enough to drop the Exec. Since Maul is stickless at this point I drop EPP Luke and His buddy Han who he barriers, so I draw some and say go. He drops Exc. with Chiraneu to Tat. and moves Maul. He draws some and says go. I remember this turn to get Kessell and use 3-PO to PUT IT BACK IN THE DECK. I flash Outrider. Drop Dash, Wedge, Talon and Outrider in front of Exec. I drop down Iâ€™ll take the Leader AO, Battle Plan/First Strike, flip my obj. and initiate battle. Power six Executor vs. Power 9 Outrider. He draws a 4 I draw a 1 and a 4. He losses Chiraneu and a couple. His turn he drops Zuckass in boat, Ponda and Dr. E and Piett. I barrier Zukass. He has no force left so he says go. I drop Mirax in Red Squad 2 with a cannon. Initiate blow Zuckass away. Reduce his power. Draw 2 ones he draws a 3. He loses Pondo/Dr. E and Piett plus a few off the top. I move Luke and Han in front of Maul. Now here is where it got interesting. I realized on the flip side of my obj. I canâ€™t grab Kessell. So I figured he had a ton of Admirals or characters in his hand to beat down on my space or he would have lost the Exec. instead of from his deck. He proceeds to drop Xizor, Boleo, and Zukass at three Jabbaâ€™s sites. Leaving the Exec. all alone. Hmm. I CTV from my hand. Get Melas I CTV from lost to get ECC Chewie. Drop them in front of Zukass. (Should have been Xizor but I thought I had to have greater) I initiate battles at 3 locations. I win them all causing mass damage. He then with 15 or more cards in his deck draws up. Because he doesnâ€™t want me to start retrieving. Hmmm.

Great game. Lots of battles.

My opinion is you play until you have 3 or less cards before you draw up. Why screw your opp. because you lost? 
<br />
My not knowing what cards do.
<br />
<br />
Game 3 My WYS vs. Nick Glazer Watto (2000â€™s)
<br />
<br />
I can beat Watto Obj. easily with this deck. IF I START THE RACE! That is right for the first 2 turns I did not start the race or draw for the race. Pretty cool huh? 
<br />
<br />
First turn he flips and makes me lose two. Fun. I draw some. He drops Palpy to hand w/ Watto makes me lose two. Fun. I search for Honor. 
<br />
<br />
Now here is where I need to take a deep breath.
<br />
<br />
NO HONOR OF THE JEDI. Oh yeah I took it out. Yep I took it out of the deck. Why I dunno. Probably because I thought wow Iâ€™m really good. Iâ€™m the man. Everyone should bow to me. I suck. Horribly.
<br />
<br />
Well this lose two lasted for about the whole game. I had nothing. Nothing. Except EPP Han and ECC Lando. So I drop them to Watto land and battle. He watches me miss w/ Lando and the Force Fields Hanâ€™s shot. I lose Han and some off the top. He Force Lightningâ€™s Lando. Yes Iâ€™m cool. Next turn I drop EPP Luke who gets barriered. He drops 4-LOM and Mighty Jabba. I cry. And barrier 4-LOM. He battles Luke to oblivion. I have 3 cards left in my deck. None in hand. 
<br />
<br />
At this point I have to take a deep breath.
<br />
<br />
I CAN FLIP HIS OBJ. WITHOUT KILLING WATTO. Yep a lonely P-60 has been Mos Epsa the WHOLE game. All I had to do was kick him off and bam. Obj. flips. Why I didnâ€™t do this I dunno. Probably because I thought wow Iâ€™m really good. Iâ€™m the man. Everyone should bow to me. I suck. Horribly.

Nick for being cool. On his second turn he drained me and then stared at me for a bit. Hoping I would start the race. He gave me plenty of opportunity. Thanks.

<br />
Game 4: My Senate vs. Jerahmiahâ€™s Pod/Profit (1900â€™s)
<br />
<br />
After my horrible playing against Nick I figured I would get to play a scrub. FAT CHANCE. When I saw this deck I figured I had little chance. I started Mara and EJP Dengar. He starts Honor. He then points out I canâ€™t drain at the Senate until I occupy 3 battlegrounds. Stupid non-battle ground Senate. He makes it so Maul has to take a bus to get to Jabbaâ€™s house.
<br />
<br />
First turn I go for a stick, DB, and drop Paply to watch frozen Han. He draws up. I drop Maul w/ stick and get Lot and scrub to the senate. Everyone moves over out of the chamber. So far so good. He drops Ben to free Han. I drop EPP Vader get I Have You Now. Whack Han. Ben misses. I draw 3 destiny. Man am I dumb Luke is not there. So I put the high one back and get 2 ones. He draws a 6. I lose Vader he reg. Han. Fun. Maul moves to the DB. He drains, makes me lose, then drops Land and Master Luke then moves over. In front of Palpy, Mara w/stick, Dengar. 
<br />
<br />
Now at this point I have to take a deep breath.
<br />
<br />
IN MY HAND I HAVE FORCE LIGHTNING. I drop a Senate Scrub and battle. I shoot Han w/ Dengar miss. Shoot again hit.. He attempts to exclude Palpy. I play Force Field.
<br />
<br />
At this point I have to take a deep breath.
<br />
<br />
I SWING AT MASTER LUKE. Why I dunno. Probably because I thought wow Iâ€™m really good. Iâ€™m the man. Everyone should bow to me. I suck. Horribly. I had the Force lightning I could have used on Ben. I could have swung at Ben. Instead I missed Luke. Luke bounced Dengar back to my hand. And Han missed the Senator and Ben missed Mara. I play I Have you now. He draws a 13 for destiny I draw a 3. Fun.

<br />
This was great tournament. I saw some others play and hope the turn out stays high cause the field looked varied. I made some good trades but latter learned Carl made better. Good job Clint and RIW.
