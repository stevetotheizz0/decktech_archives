<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Start with 3rd &amp; 5th Marker and overpower your opponent.
The strength of this deck lies in the amount of character/vehicles/starships. Your opponent thinks itâ€™s all over, but it isnâ€™t.
It has itâ€™s weaknesses, but I like it for itâ€™s simplicity.
Give it a try and donâ€™t forget to be patient. So keep force and and a striking force waiting.
