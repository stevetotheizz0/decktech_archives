<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>I made a deck similar to this right after Endor was released.  It was fun, but it had a few problems.  The biggest two were react-hosing cards, and Don’t Forget the Droids.  I have attempted to fix those problems in this version of the deck.  Here’s how to beat specific deck types</p>

<p>vs. Mains of any sort - Start BFHI.  Use Tactical support to find the right Bikers.  Elsek is like a reacting Ghhhk.  After you flip, try to control Raithal, and hit them with numbers.  Pull a grabber for DFTD.  There are three basic ways that they can stop your reacts</p>
<ul>
  <li>Frozen Assets/Beggar If you suspect hat your opponent is using this, drop a Comm Cheif with Elskek.</li>
  <li>Sense Grab the Sense.  Unless your opponent has a hand full of Senses, and a ton of force, somehing should be able to react.</li>
  <li>Beezer/Lock Use You Rebel Scum to remove their texts.  YRS is also useful to prevent Obi from moving Elsek away.</li>
</ul>

<p>vs. Ops - Flip ASAP, then set up Decree and Numbers.  Crossfire prevents a Speeder beatdown.</p>

<p>vs. HB - Start BFHI to prevent early EPP squads.  Use TIES/DSAS with APTW (you can fetch it every turn, if it doesn’t get snagged).  Crossfire + TIE Defenders take care of S-Foils.  Grab Organized Attack.  Try to hold Ralltiir, and let the numbers do their thing.</p>

<p>Other notes
-I used Desert/Jungle because they work well with the Speeder Bikes immunity to attrition.  The Prefect’s Office is for Burnsk, who is a destiny 3 trooper, that is also a leader.  Along with IAO, this makes all the unique scouts forfieit +3 on Ralltiir.	The DB is there in case I have to drop a TIE @ Ralltiir to flip.</p>

<p>-Carida is imortant, since it lets you recycle the Biker Scouts.  Aratech Corp. is nice, but I don’t think it’s worth the card slto, since there are only 5 Bikes in the deck.</p>

<p>-The Hoth sites are primarily for activaton, but can be used for Decree, if you can’t hold two systems.</p>

<p>Everything else is prety self-explanitory.  If your opponent is playing Ultimatum (which few people do), try to insert quickly before it goes into effect.  Any suggestions are welcome.</p>
