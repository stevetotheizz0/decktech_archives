<br />
Got up around 8 in the morning. Went to the kitchen and turn on the coffee maker god. I do not know who created the coffee machine but it is a wondrous machine. Crawled to the living room, and woke up the band of misfits and undergrad. of the star wars. James, Eddy and josh. They were not happy for being woken up after 3 hours of sleep but too bad. Like I give a fly crap&amp;#8230;hehehe any way. Took a shower drank my coffee and started the mighty blue (it is car that does not know the meaning of death). Let see, 20 year old BMW, that has 300,000 miles and still does 100+ miles an hour. Yes, I am a speed demon with a legal license for last 10 years. Man, Germans really know how to built the ultimate machine. It is a beast. Oh, did I mention that I never take care of it. No oil change in 4 years, any engine checks accept for water. Well, we leave at 10:00 o&amp;#8217;clock to get to a tournament that starts at 12:30 which is only 82 miles away and we still get their late. Retard drivers, 2 crashes in 405 and a major slow down on 5 for what reason no one knows. Oh course with my extensive knowledge of the freeway system in LA, we manage to get there in 3 freaking hours. (WTF) I still love LA. From beaches to desert.
<br />
<br />
All right let me get down to the fundamentals of the tournaments.
<br />
<br />
When we arrived in Tustin, we can barely walk in. Completely store was packed.   Every table, every chair every hole it was taking with star war players. So, I notice john and walked over and said hi. We had small chat and he told me my opponent and gave us an extended time for late start. Which was nice and generous of him. Thank you john
<br />
<br />
My decks:
<br />
Evil side- Endor opts death star 2 that floats in space
<br />
Good side- hidden base with pod racing and matching pilot sets
<br />
<br />
My evil side versus a guy with a hidden swarm pod racing. 
<br />
This was over before it was started. I had no security precaution, and no pod racing. WOW what a luck.
<br />
<br />
He starts with yarma and I start with Jerrold, death star 2 and mop points. This was the nice part of the game. I activate and deploy Jerrold, death star 2 mop points. I grab sector and a waulkeum and deploy and draw the rest. He deploys endor over my endor and deploys 2 &amp;#8211;x wings to Endor and moves them to death star two for a nice drain of 5. NOT on my watch. So he draws his left force and says go. Before I active I grab the next sector and 3 non-unique ties and with all power to weapons. I activate. He starts racing, I decide not too. Too dangerous with what I need. He draws 4 and a 6. Great&amp;#8230;. Any ways I deploy my ties to death star two. I battle and win by 6 to 12 and he loses both ships. I feel relaxed but I know this is just a start of things. He activates and deploys Kiffexs and draws.  At this point I notices that he has a nice beefy hand. I grab the last sector, activate and deploy the sector and then the thing is operational. Deploy 2 ties to Endor and move the ties from death star to Endor for protection. And draw the rest. He activates and deploys kessel, kiffex, corusant, naboo, and 4 x-wings to Endor with a x-wing canon, x-wing to naboo, kiffex, kessel and corusant. He has just four force left. He initiation the battle and uses 3 force to shot a tie. Before he draws his destiny, I say &amp;#8220;little too fast buddy&amp;#8221; and put out all power to weapons. But he forgets about the organized attack and shoots the tie in out of the sky. But after weapon phase he puts down organized attack and I say &amp;#8220;you can not do that, its just initiated action, sorry.&amp;#8221; He nods and pulls his destiny of 4 and I pull 2. He looks at me and says u do not get destiny. I show him my death star sector (which states that if the death star orbits the system u occupy u add another destiny) and he gets pissed off but its cool. He loses a x-wing and I lose two ties. Damm attrition. My turn, I activate and he draws for pod racing and wins. Wow what a surprise. I move my lonely tie to death star and move death star to parsecs 5 and lose 6 force and he gets 6 back.  I draw the rest up. He activates and flips and drains for @#$% loads of force. I lose rest of the ties. I activate and deploy chimera to kessel with a tie and another one to corusant and battle. He plays organized attack and out of nowhere and I lose the tie at corusant. He loses nothing. I initiate a battle at kessel and he loses the x-wing and 6 more. Which was nice. Move death star to Waulikemi for nice force lost which I was hoping for. Plus move the death star pimp Jerrold to docking bay. He activates and drains for 5 and deploys @#$% load of x-wings to kessel and few to corusant and Honor of the Jedi. @#$%TT He initiates the battle at kessel and I lose the chimera and the tie. That just blows right there. He draws it up the rest. I activate and make him lose the three forces, which he reduces by two and drain of awesome 1 at the docking, bay. I remember to deploy the sinear fleet and deploy Endor shield and sword to death star and retrieve 6 of six. I deploy Vader to help the death star pimp at the docking bay. I say go. He activates and drains for muscular 10. I look at him and say &amp;#8220;I love hidden base swarm,&amp;#8221; he laughs and deploys aim high combo and Jedi Luke to docking bay. Deploys another x-wing to kiffexs and moves to wualikein to make my ties deploy +2. Great. And draws again. I activate and make him lose for three and again he reduces it by 2 and. I draw the rest of my cards up and shacked his hand. Lose by 20
<br />
<br />
Props: For hidden base 
<br />
Slops: not deploy sinear fleet out since first turn. And he forgetting to cancel my drains. 
<br />
This guy is a real good player. He plays his game. Sorry dude for forgetting your name. I apologies. 
<br />
<br />
Game 2
<br />
My good side VS James Zajic hidden weapons speed deal
<br />
<br />
This pairing sucked from the start. We drove 90 miles to play each other. I could of done that at home. He starts with like 8 effects, in which kind of sucks but its cool. I started with pod racing and squadron assignments. He activates and gets his docking bay, dark deal, two sites and draws. But I start pod racing with two 6&amp;#8217;s. &amp;#8220;NICE&amp;#8221; I activate and deploy Endor and look for hobby. He was not there so I put green squadron to rendezvous point and move it too Endor for free. He activates and gets bespin: cloud city and deploys fat Jabba to chamber. I draw another 6&amp;#8217;s, which is awesome. He says go. I activate and drain for 1 again and deploy kiffexs. Deploy general Lando and millieum falcon to kiffexs and leave two forces. I got in my hand at that time hyper escape and hoijics combo. I feel safe. He activates and deploys, Vader to chamber and three ties too cloud city.  I notify him that he lost the pod racing and he loses 6 force. He draws it up. I activate and drain for 2 and deploy Kessel and Roche and Jedi Luke with Artoo in red 7 to cloud sector. Also deploy mirax to pod racing arena to retrieve one a turn. I leave two force left over. He activate and drains for 1 and deploys ig-88 2000, dengar to cloud sector and initiates a battle. I pull out do not get @#$%y and make him lose a tie and play out of now where for another battle destiny. I draw two 6&amp;#8217;s and he draws a 6 and 1, which was wrong. He lost everyone there accept ig-88 2000 and lost Luke. I active and retrieve one and force drain of 4. I deploy dash and ship to kessel, red 9 to Roche. And draw some. He activates and put draws maul and boba fett and deploys dark deal and says go. I activate and drain for 10 and deploy Han and Leai to cloud city and battled boba fett. I win barely and flip my objective. I cancel his force drains and drain for 10 a turn. That was it. No surprise. I win by 36.

Third game
<br />
<br />
My good side versus some kids senators. 
<br />
<br />
He is just learning the game so I decided to help him a little. He activates and draws. I activate and deploy Endor, kessel, Roche, kiffexs with dash and his ship. I draw the rest up. He actives and starts pod racing. And draw the rest. I am wondering now if this kid faking me out. SO I decided to scan his with monok. Only one I had so, he is senator tight. WOW.  Drain for one and grab sullust and deploy red 9, red 8, pulsar escape, and red leader in red 1 to all the planets and draw the lonely force up. He actives and we both draw for destiny and he deploys all of his senators to the counsel, deploys some effects and draws. I activate and drain for 10. Drew some up. He activates and draws for racing, deploys zukuss in mist hunter to kessel and battles. I use hyper escape away and he scans for hidden and move to Endor. I activate and drain and deploy red 2 and red 7 with Luke to Endor and battle. He loses and gives up 6 cards. I move red 7 with Luke to kessel and say go. He activates and draws destiny for pod racing in which loses six forces. He deploys cantina and deploys maul and senator there. I activate and drain him out. I know it is not a pretty match but nothing there to help him. He was playing ground I was playing space. Win by 32

<br />
Fourth game 
<br />
<br />
My dark side Vs there is good in him full Endor control
<br />
<br />
I do not remember too much about his game. Only thing I remember was he had all the sites in Endor and drain me out. I could not get anything down. He had Endor protected like fort knoxs. He was the man.
<br />
There was the funniest moment in the late game. I was trying to set up imperial decree with zuckuss in the mist hunter. I deploy him to Endor docking bay and moved it too home one docking bay. It was classic. We had to call the TD John Patchell to see if it was legal. Dan Lujan was laugh his @#$% of because the balls out move. I control the Endor system with 8 ties which gave him power of 8 on ground with a forfeit and a destiny. Tell me if that took balls.

<br />
<br />
Fifth game
<br />
<br />
My good side Vs tattooing some crap. (Seriously this deck was just weird.) It was the same guy in second game.
<br />
<br />
He deploys jabbas palace and expands the empire.  Next thing I know, he deploys like 8 sites from reserve deck. I look up this guy has all the sites out. I turn to him and say, &amp;#8220; what the hell is this?&amp;#8221; He says expand the empire, an old Meta trick. Not to be insulting, I call john and ask him if this is legal. He says &amp;#8220;yep.&amp;#8221; He deploys Mara and Vader with a stick to two jabbas sites and puts down search and destroys. There was the game. I won the pod racing and but lost a planet in a force drain and was never able to flip my objective. 
<br />
It was something new I learned which was cool.

<br />
Slops: for losing a planet and that sucked.

<br />
Sixth game
<br />
<br />
By now I was tired and need some break. I talked to Dan lujan about how his senator deck is doing and what to expect in decks. I went out and joined my fellow smokers for a drag. 
<br />
<br />
My dark side vs. there is good in him.
<br />
<br />
This game is all about drains. No battle. I canceled his drains with two spies and he never came to space. I put out cartina and put a lonely tie with a presence of the force and drain him for 4 a turn. He looked helpless and I did not there to go to ground. There was no tech or Meta in this game. We laughed about the senators and john interference in the games.
