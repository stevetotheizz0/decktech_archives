<p>Specific Card selections</p>

<p>Battle Order most profit decks donâ€™t play any space, itâ€™s worth it to pay to drain for a few turnstill you get a GOOD ship.
No Escaperetrieval(LOL), if opponent plays the  SpaceportDBdeploying chars at -3 is HUGE
Presence of the ForceLets make Vader a spy(inside joke)play it and drop in.
Disarmedit is KING, hurts enhanced chars, Dr. E can opperate, and power loss
Masterful Moverecycling 6, if Visage is Cancelled go and get another
Dreadnaught &amp; Chimaeraships with good power
Mâ€™ilyoom Onithkill chars out of hand, WHEEEE
2* Janusno other way to cycling cards</p>

<p>Specific Matchups</p>

<p>HB use Secret Plans in start, look for Security Precautions Search and Destroy and ships, probe(donâ€™t spread) and drain.</p>

<p>EBO use Imperial Decree to stop HUGE drains, try to conrol 2 Hoth sites without Vader(Ice Storm will make Vader lost)</p>

<p>Profit use Battle Order to screw opponents drains, still put Zucuss and another ship on Rendili. Start Mara and Dr. E as your aliens. Use Bad Feeling Have I and Mâ€™iiyoom Onith to stop your opponent dead.</p>

<p>Mains and Toys or numberswhen in doubt play You Cannot Hide Forever</p>

<p>PLEASE REVIEW. thank you.
