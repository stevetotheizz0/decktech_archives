I"‘<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">My light side - Chadra-Fans of Hades
<br />
My dark side - Destroyer Droids of Hades
<br />
<br />
Both my deck lists can be found in my profile.
<br />
<br />
GAME 1
<br />
My DARK vs. Darylâ€™s LIGHT Profit deck
<br />
<br />
Daryl didnâ€™t seem to have a very organized deck. He everything ranging from mains to systems and sites. He even set up Cloud City Celebration at one point. Anyway, he put a couple mains down at the Audience Chamber and freed Han. I dropped down with three Destroyer Droids, shot Han, shot whoever else was there and forfeited the Destroyers (that was the whole point). He could not longer Force drain on Tatooine and I just canceled his drains at Kessel using Where Are Those Droidekas (which also pulled my destroyers out for me ^_^ ). I dropped down on any squad he put down and overwhelmed him with weapon hit damage. Easy win.

GAME 2
<br />
My LIGHT vs. Darylâ€™s DARK Carbon Chamber Testing deck
<br />
<br />
Hmmm...Daryl again, eh? No matter. My Chadra-Fan deck had no Rebels so he instantly flipped. He did not know the wrath of my Chadra-Fan deck so he deployed unwisely. I dropped Sandwhirl on the Hutt Trade Route sending Dr. Evazan &amp; Ponda Boba and Vader with saber missing. He deployed at my Death Star docking bay so I dropped and stomped there. My Tessek Force drain booster really overwhelmed him. Another easy win.

GAME 3
<br />
My DARK vs. Perryâ€™s LIGHT Watch Your Step deck
<br />
<br />
Watch Your Step? Iâ€™ll do that. First turn, I slap down the Blockade Flagship: Bridge! And I put Nute Gunray there! YEEHAW! Excellent start so far. I take over the Cantina quickly with P-60 and two destroyers. He deploys to Kessel. I stop his mean drains with my effect. I deploy two destroyers to the docking bay. He comes down with Luke with saber and Chewie with gun. I play Master, Destroyers on Luke and play Oh, Switch Off when Chewie targets me. I hit both of his dudes. Crossfire kicks in of course. He loses everything. I forfeit one guy to attrition. I reinforce that area a bit. He has Battle Plan down. Ouch. I retrieve about 8 force using Abyssin Ornament for free (he didnâ€™t have Aim High). He cancels my Cantina drains with some interrupts (I forgot its title). He deploys to docking bay after having a Kessel Run retrieval canceled (he didnâ€™t save any for my Secret Plans). I initiate there and I am attacked by Fallen Portal. I save my droids with Oh, Switch Offs and resume fighting. I shoot a couple of his guys and get attritionized to death there. I never manage to take the docking bay over again so his drains are free now. He keeps canceling my Cantina drain with that interrupt that I forgot its name to. I canâ€™t hang on and he barely kills me.

GAME 4
<br />
My LIGHT vs. Mikalâ€™s DARK Death Star II Occupational deck
<br />
<br />
This is not my day. Mikal knows my Chadra-Fan deck INSIDE and OUT! Itâ€™s not fair! He avoids my Chadra-Fans and uses Darth Maul to restrain them. Not much to tell...he occupies me to death...canâ€™t...stop...it...

Believe it or not, I took third! Woohoo! I later refined my dark deck to have two After Hers! I play tested on Mikal and it retrieves very nicely! Woohoo! Resistance also saved my hide. </font></td>
