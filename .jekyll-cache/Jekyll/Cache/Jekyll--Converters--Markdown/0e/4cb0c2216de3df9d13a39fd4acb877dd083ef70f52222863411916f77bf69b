OK Game 1-My LS vs Drew Houston's Dark Side Death Star drain deck
<br />
<br />
I showed up late for the tournament because I was taking the train so Drew was already waiting for me...The game starts and he starts the D* and presence and I start the Dagobah stuff.  I get set up quickly with DOS and Yoda training to test one as he drains for 1 from the D*.  Quickly with my force activation I get encampment set up with Ithorians and gas miners draining and also have a steady 2 drain at the holotable.  He eventually spreads out at some planets to get drains of 1 at 3 or 4 planets and I come down with some Gold Ywings to stop his drains.  My drains at the generic sites were just too much with the ithorians as he just ran out of things to deploy in space and I was able to pick at the one ships to stop his drains.
<br />
<br />
FW +8
<br />
<br />
Highlights-winning with the worst deck I ever built and never getting any clouds to drain with out.
<br />
Lowlights-having too many cards on the table to make the idea work.
<br />
<br />
Game 2-My Dark Side vs Aman Seth's Yoda on Tatooine Deck
<br />
<br />
This game was typical Huntdown start for me, Tatooine and JP for him.  First Turn I get DLOTS to the JP to flip the objective and he loses to the drain and visage for a few turns.  The third turn I through down Epp Fett and Blizzard Scout 1 down for some protection from EPP Madness with two tramples in my hand.  His turn he signals for Encampment and I automatically know that Yoda is coming down!  Cant Duel the little muppet!  Crap, no problem.  He deploys Bron Burs so he can play encampment but I trample him before he gets another action. Nice move by me!  My turn more drains and more visage damage.  His turn he tries again with EPP Han to play encampment and I trample the gambler too.  The rest of the game he eventually gets the muppet down and moves him over.  We both start taking visage damage but my steady drains for most of the game have almost killed him.  I cause Yoda some Counter Assault damage and then go an battle him after he deploys Chewbacca with him.  I replace with EPP Vader and clash Yoda after he starts a battle, I beat of chewie and he loses the rest to battle damage.
<br />
<br />
FW +27
<br />
<br />
Highlights-Getting 3 destinies in space with the Bus and Res luk.
<br />
Lowlights-none, the deck worked perfectly
<br />
<br />
Game 3-My Dark Side vs John Lolli's CC Sabaac
<br />
<br />
John is one of my best friends so we usually play against each other all the time but school has caused some distance problems...sad but true.  So I had no clue what he was playing until he started the Casino and Leia's Hut (that and he told me earlier how he stole vader's saber).  I was not worried going in because if he was to drain the game would be mine with all of the low power characters like Lando and Pucimir running around.  First Turn I get Darth Vader down to the casino and start draining.  He takes a few drains and visage when he plays EPP Ben and battles.  We both lose the characters somehow and the objective flips.  I then Draw Epp Vader, Circle and Focused attack as he redeploys Obi-Wan and Colt 45 to the casino.  He tries to off the edge but does not retrieve any.  I get out secret plans and CHYBC along with Blizzard Scout 1 against a weaponless Lando and Obi.  I try to masterful move and he plays SENSE!  I was not expecting that so I needed to lure senses out of his hand for the duel.  I battle and play I have you now...he senses but misses.  Then I swing and hit lando and then duel...no sense.  I play focused attack and start to draw destines.  I draw a zero!  1!  And a five.  I add one to each because of the saber but I am panicking because my destinies are unbelievable in this deck so I get worried.  He draws two destinies and we add up...at first I thought I lost but I did win and make him lose.  Then I finished pounding on Colt 45 for some decent damage.  From there the game was just draining and beating on Orrimaarko.  He Cancelled Visage But I just brought another one out.  He eventually drew up to appease me 8).
<br />
<br />
FW +23
<br />
<br />
Highlight-Barely winning the duel against obi.
<br />
Lowlights-Nothing 8).
<br />
<br />
At this point Ray Bordier won his third game but played the same side so we would not be paired up.  Same with Chris Gogolen but he had one timed win so if I went 4-0 I would not have to worry about him passing me.
<br />
<br />
Game 4-My Crap LS vs Aman Seth's DS Nal Hutta Ops.
<br />
<br />
Ok I knew he was not playing speed ops but later found out Nal Hutta was for a cheaper Jabba and for the Boelo and crew to come along.  My deck actually started out slow since he saw my deck first game and knew to start with Bad Feeling.  I eventually got daughter and yoda out and altered the bad feeling while playing Projections on his sites.  I quickly got out Ithorians after that and a gas miner with a y wing at 2 clouds.  I passed the jedi test on first try so his drains went down to 1 and 0 with the projections quickly.  He started to deploy on different sites and was able to flip so it cut my drains down.  Things were still going well as I was able to drain him 6 a turn.  After I got out the third cloud, I was draining for even more which beat the three he was draining for a turn.  Late game he played a power 2 character and I was able to sac Yoda for nine force back to ensure the victory.  A Late game tibana miner with encampment and SOS help clear a site to slow the drains down even more.  Getting reflection out on DOS early also helped retrieving every turn.
<br />
<br />
FW +18
<br />
<br />
Hightlights-winning again with a completely crap deck!
<br />
Lowlights-realizing I should have never played this deck.
<br />
<br />
So I went 4-0 but came in second to Ray because of differential.
<br />
