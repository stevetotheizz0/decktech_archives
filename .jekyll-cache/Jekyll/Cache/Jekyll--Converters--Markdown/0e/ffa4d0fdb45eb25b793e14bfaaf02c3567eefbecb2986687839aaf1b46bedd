<p>2xCPI ‘</p>

<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>The purpose of this deck is to destroy Alderaan while minimizing opponents drains against</p>

<p>you. Youll manage to blow A in about 3-4 turns. So it will happen quite fast.</p>

<p>There is a lot of ways to keep your force loss limited to what you can easily handle.</p>

<p>Start with Battle Order in allmost every case, so early draining will cost.</p>

<p>Strategic reserves will also help get Gunner, cancel drain, deploy him, search for LASER</p>

<p>and so on… youll end up stopping their best drain allmost every turn(untill you flip).</p>

<p>When you finally flip, just start invading space. Play systems from reserve and begin to</p>

<p>summon your tremendous fleet. There is a horde of destroyers so you should have no shortage</p>

<p>for space power. Retrieving capabilities of this deck are awesome and allmost unmached</p>

<p>Keep destroyers coming If opponent kills few, deploy more and retrieve and so on…</p>

<p>Activation should not be a problem. With your Death Star and its sites you get a lot while</p>

<p>your friend gets none. Also systems provide a bunch for you both. Mobilization points</p>

<p>not includet, because they just get suspendet in early game when they are most usefull.</p>

<p>Important Remember when you flip you are no longer immune to battle damage at the moon.</p>

<p>So gather your crew to avoid beatdowns</p>

<p>If opponent plays ground, he can attempt to take your DS-sites. This must be stopped</p>

<p>Many of your pilots are mains istead of whimpy admirals, so they can fight at ground also.</p>

<p>And remeber to “Put all sections on alert”</p>

<p>In overall this deck focuses on heavy draining and even heavier retrieval and drain stopping.</p>

<p>Play wise and patiently and you will win</p>

<p>Why not “Imperial command” deck??? Because of “Dont do that again” it gets grabbed very early.</p>

<p>And quickly controlled Docking bays no longer provide huge activation. Also admirals arent</p>

<p>very usefull in ground warfare. Multiple destinies is stopped by two Guris</p>

<p>Why not more DS-sites??? Because you want flip soon, and you dont want to have any zeros</p>

<p>appearing as your destinies.</p>

<p>If SAC is popularin your area, replace “Oppressive Enforcement” with the combo version.</p>

<p>Some card explanations</p>

<p>Vader with saber Best Vader for this kind of deck. No room for his saber.</p>

<p>Captain Godlherdt Anti Landing claw.</p>

<p>Daroe With the number of star destroyers he can(and will) suprise you opponent</p>

<p>Tarkins orders Cancels a bunch of often played cards. Also can stop drains several times.</p>

<p>And some matchups</p>

<p>WYS Tricky. They will kill some of your activation, so be patient and gather force.</p>

<p>You will retrieve/stop enough drains to survive of their early upperhand.</p>

<p>Then eventually conquer space and the game is yours Be sure to take each system with</p>

<p>at least two destroyers(preferrably with 3-4), incase they play beatdown verion.</p>

<p>Crush them with your power Guri will save you from their destinies. Battle deployment will help.</p>

<p>QMC/RST Easy. Take space. Win drain race Your   retrieval will be to much for them.</p>

<p>TIGH 	Just see that your power is enough in battles and game is yours.</p>

<p>Podracing You have no podracer, because if they do Podracing you will lose the race.</p>

<p>But no problem Just retrieve damage what they have caused. I did it wont hurt you too much</p>

<p>EBO Take space and win. Destroy Hoth and smile If they play swarm, keep your boats at</p>

<p>groups and Battle deployment with Thrawn will eat their power.</p>

<p>Profit	Real drain race coming up with this deck. Their direct damage will hurt,</p>

<p>but your draining and retrieval potial is higher so you should win.</p>

<p>Mains If they play docking bays use Fanfare. Theyll probably try take your sites, so be</p>

<p>prepared to fight there. Kill them with drains</p>

<p>MBO Take fight to Yavins ground. Kill their Assault run boosters and take their sites</p>

<p>Your mains will crush their weak characters. Destroy Yavin 4 and win</p>

<p>Thats about all I could remember. So thanks for your rewiews ‘</p>
