<p>Strategy: ‚Äò</p>

<p>First off, this deck is based somewhat on the Martin/Maarten RalOps deck, so I freely acknowledge the creator(s) of that deck here.</p>

<p>This deck works like most RalOps decks, with a couple little twists from DS2, which I‚Äôll explain below.</p>

<p>Admirals‚Äôs Orders
Battle Deployment
lets you search for a walker each turn and keeps those EPP‚Äôs from drawing multi destinies, but this is only for use at the early and early-mid game stages of the game. Once you‚Äôve set up on Raltiir, switch to We‚Äôre In Attack Position.</p>

<p>WIAP
Strengthens your space slightly, but the big reason for using this is the following ‚ÄúDuring each of your control phases, opponent loses 1 Force for each battleground site your general or commander controls that is related to a system you occupy.‚Äù Can we say, Raltiir Occupation? I thought so. With 2 Generals and 3 commanders, you should be able to control those 3 raltiir sites (and maybe some offworld) for the occupation-like effect of the AO.</p>

<p>Interrupts
Imperial Command
Pure tech. Destiny 4 used interrupt that A) lets you grab an Admiral or general from Reserve (see above for applications of Generals), B) lets you add a destiny if you have an Admiral or General in their correct theatre (space and ground, respectively), or C) lets you prevent opponent from drawing mutliple destiny in a like situation. This can kill the Super Falcon if the opponent isn‚Äôt ready for it. It also puts a damper on EPP hit-squads.</p>

<p>Starships
Chimaera
Ability 2, immune to less than 4. Enough said.</p>

<p>Characters
Colonel Davod Jon
He‚Äôs the man for holding down a site. Power 3, ability 2, but when he‚Äôs at an exterior planet site, he gets +2 power, a destiny draw, and immune to less than 3. Plus, he can cancel Surprise Assault in certain situations.</p>

<p>Commander Merrejk
He‚Äôs a commander, so that‚Äôs a plus right away. Also, he‚Äôs a pilot and he can grab battleground systems from the deck (only Kashyyyk, but that‚Äôs 1 less 0 and leaves you free to use your objective for something else).</p>

<p>Sim Aloo
Power 3, Ability 4, Immune to less than 4, and he can screw with the opponent‚Äôs destiny tracking for 1 force. Sounds like a deal to me.</p>

<p>Other Misc. Info
Battle Order isn‚Äôt set in stone as the third starting effect, that can be switched to Plans or Decree depending on the opponent‚Äôs start. BO is default b/c it is likely to slow the opponent the most.</p>

<p>Omni Box screws up destiny tracking and Baragwins, plus it‚Äôs a recycling 5.</p>

<p>I decided to go a little lower on AT-STs because I wanted lots of characters that could draw destiny solo. Plus, I can grab one each turn once I find Battle Deployment (ie, as soon as I flip).</p>

<p>Questions to readers
Should I use more space with DS2 seeming to boost space a lot?</p>

<p>Should I take out some characters for AT-STs? If so, which ones?</p>

<p>Would I be better off taking out the limited SAC for some other stuff, like catch cards or Monnoks?</p>

<p>What other effects might be good to include?</p>

<p>Do I have enough locations to be effective early on?</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far (If you didn‚Äôt read this far, well, you suck). Please respond to my questions, either in your reviews or by d-mail.
