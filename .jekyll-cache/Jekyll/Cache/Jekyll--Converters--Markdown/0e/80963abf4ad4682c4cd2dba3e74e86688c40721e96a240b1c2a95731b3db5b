<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">ok i was in a hurry the last time i wrote this report, 
<br />
but there are some things that i must add.
<br />
firstly during the drive to phoenix from tucson, 
<br />
i decided that i hate WYS, and i dont want to play it.
<br />
its a winning deck. it is a good deck. BUT it is just too
<br />
much cheese for me to play it, and be proud of myself.
<br />
So i opt for my There Is Good I Obi deck. 
<br />
justin beal says that his LS deck sux, and he wants to use mine. 
<br />
i think this is ok since i wont be using it.
<br />
so anyways AFTER the tournament i find out that beal
<br />
went undefeated in his LS portion of the tournament. 
<br />
his only loss was to hayes with his DS AoBS deck.
<br />
this makes me feel like crap because i got second to last in the tournament. 
<br />
of course both time i played hayes i should have beaten him.
<br />
this bring me to another part that i left out. 
<br />
when i was playing my MotR deck(maul on the rocks) 
<br />
i had seven force, and time was called to end the game on 
<br />
my turn.
<br />
i was not going to draw, so that he couldnt just do some damage to me, 
<br />
and then i would loose totally. 
<br />
hayes would then only win on time. i thought this was good.
<br />
hayes was surprised when i didnt draw out, and he said "you know
<br />
im going to loose a lot of points if you dont draw out"
<br />
being hayes’ friend i said "oh yeah, how many?"
<br />
"32" and after this i considered how close he was to brian hunter,
<br />
and i considered my own ranking. he was very close to being
<br />
number one in the world, and i didnt want to rob him of it.
<br />
if we wernt in tournament play he would eventually have won
<br />
the game, but it was called on time. i decided i wouldnt be
<br />
a @#$% to a good friend, so i drew up. of course i had about 3 
<br />
people say some @#$% like "that is BS because he should loose points"
<br />
which just means everyone else was just jealous cuz i didnt
<br />
bend over and rape a good friend of mine. overall, i think
<br />
i took the right choice. plus i think hayes’ might have liked
<br />
the rapage because he grabed my leg in the car ride on the way home.
<br />
(dont deny it hayes, you flamer)
<br />
overall i had a fun time, and the best part about the experiance 
<br />
was the trip, and not the star wars.
<br />
for prize support i won a enchanced CC pack with the IG88 in it.
<br />
highs: 
<br />
playing my obi deck, and beating the hell outta hayes and 
<br />
some guy who was playing on hoth.
<br />
<br />
lows: 
<br />
having been cheated and lost the last game which i shouldnt have.
<br />
learning that i got second to last. 
<br />
**ALMOST** beating hayes twice, but failing both times to pull it off. </font></td>
