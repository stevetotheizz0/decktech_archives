<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>As of 2-27-01, this deck is 5-1.  It’s only loss was to a WYS step deck, in which I got very bad draws and couldn’t get enough characters to take on his ground forces.</p>

<p>Starting</p>

<p>Agents Of Black Sun/VOTDP, Coruscant, Coruscant Imperial City, Prince Xizor, Twilek Advisor for Presence Of The Force (deployed to Imperial City)</p>

<p>Strategy</p>

<p>Starting with POTF on Imp City, youll flip first turn.  This will give you some immediate damage on your opponent.  Against TIGIH, you may want to start another effect of your choice, like No Bargain or All Wrapped Up, but Ive used the normal start vs. it and wasnt too hampered by being flipped back.</p>

<p>The goal is to capture their mains and do as much battling (with you the victor, of course) on Tatooine.  Youll capture their characters  and then drain with Vigo enhancements.  The deck runs many trackable 5s, so you should be able to clear away even the biggest LS characters, and multiple Xizors, so if he leaves table, he should be back rather quickly.  With your decent drains, Vengeance manipulation and damage, you should come out on top.</p>

<p>Cases</p>

<p>v. Space Set up on Tatooine and drain away.  If they come to you, capture and retrieve.  Save your ships for large-scale beatdown operations mid- to lategame with Lateral Damage to support them.</p>

<p>v. Ground Battle and capture anything that comes your way.  Put the drain pressure on with Vigos.</p>

<p>v. TIGIH As above, butkill off Luke as fast as you can; dont capture him.  This is best accomplished with either multiple destinies and/or 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle.  This will make your opponent have to find another (if playing w/ multiples), and give you (hopefully) a few turns of lethal VOTDP benefits.</p>
