I"­<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">ok this is gay sorry for all the mess ups it was decktech! 
<br />
<br />
      This tourney was a bust! it only had 8 people and I didnâ€™t know half of there names cuz it was my 1st time there! Anyways I was playing for LS RST,Boomrace my WAY!(To be posted tonight!) and for DS I was playing 5-min HD(I only took 5 minutes when making this deck)
<br />
  At first we had trouble with the decipher program for the standings so we got that working..
<br />
  The pairings we announced and the 1st game was my LS RST vs. John Patchells DS YMSYL, 1st turn I start the race he starts no pod and I draw a 5 and 1, so I am ahead, Anyways he starts to setup his crap and drops Piett to Executor DB and pulls Executor. On my turn I find the bunker and then draw up and get my charges(2) and my Epic Event. On his turn for the race I draw a 4 and 5 so I now have 15 I think, anyways he drop executor nad moves on piett to Endor.
<br />
So I start my turn and I got the Back door out and I am waiting for the race to end, before I do anything I drop Luke and Qui-Gon to the BackDoor and I give Qui his Blade. On his turn I win the race and that follows he loses I pay 6 to get back 6. So on my turn I drop the bunker and stuff and I move in, I have to wait for the charges(that was my fatal mistake not moving in one turn earlier) anyways The game goes the walker garrison come down twice and I eat it, and he keeps dropping characters to the bunker to stop me and I end up losing.But it was an extremly FUN game!

       For Patch getting mad at my deck saying it was Cheese the whole time! =)
<br />
<br />
         Game 2 My DS vs. ????(sorry dude) WYS Racing
<br />
<br />
this was a not cool game cuz once again I got beat down. which I didnâ€™t appreciate for the most part. he starts his racing and Squad Ass. and I start Prep. with Crush,Mob Combo, Plans Combo. This game wasnâ€™t fair cuz he had no benâ€™s and didnâ€™t drop any Lukes the whole time. Well he ends up killing my pod and getting his 6 and he stays in the air and drains at kessel the whole game for the most part until the race is over. I sit back and take over my Endor DB, his CAntina with Maul Mara and P-59 and his Tat. DB with VAder with Saber and Tarkin. I got the drain of 6 and he just keeps using retrieval cards to get them back. Once during the game he dropped Melas and some Smugglers and he didnâ€™t battle so I played sniper on melas and drained for 3 and laughed! anyways I get him down to nothing and he uses kessel run and basically screws me. Game over!     FL 0(-15)  current standings 0(-24)
<br />
<br />
Ups:I actually used TAT. Mauls game text!
<br />
Downs: I donâ€™t know his name
<br />
       Retrieving at the end is gay!
<br />
       WYS is GAY!
<br />
<br />
         Game 3 my DS vs ??????(sorry dude) RST old skool
<br />
This was a very basic game and he was really wanting to play dark so he could lose and get it over with but instead he was light. He starts exaclty what Brian hunter Starts and well the deck were almost card for card exact..anyways I start the same stuff and My first turn I draw up. on his first few turns he is compelled to leave madine by hiself with no D. So on my turn the fun begins I drop VAder flip and battle Crix. I  hit him and draw a 5 for desting loses crix and 7. so I then move VAder to the Forest. he starts to draw now and gets out his scouts and his CAS. and on my few turns I drop maul and his saber and $-Lom and move them over. I battle cancel. hit,,Dark sTrike somebody..I think it was LSJK, and then the my power is like 21 to his 16 he loses the site andI lose vader. his next turn he drops Ben with saber to the back door and doesnâ€™t have enough to move. I have my spare Vader and I drop him to Benâ€™s site, Duel 6 and 5 to his 2,2 I win Ben and 9. that Duel seals the game and after that the game ends in drains.
<br />
  FW 2(+16)   current standings 2(-8)

<br />
     I won!

         Game 4. My LS against Sean?? DS Destroyes TDIGWATT
<br />
<br />
This was a very fun game my massive retrieval vs. his massive drains. I start the race and he has no pod. I end up blowing the bunker on turn 3 and he loses 8 I retrieve 8, now I am at 23 for the race on turn 4 and I draw my 6 and a 5 he loses the race and 6 I retrieve 6 more. He drop Maul App. to Downtown and about 4 turns later I drop Ben and Corran to fight. I battle for free and I hit Maul, and play Blaster Prof. Combo and toast Maul, gone just toaster. anyways I take control of his site and he drop EV-9D9 to a site and moves all of his droids to that same sight. I drain for like 6 and then he was 1!!!!!!!!!! card left and I take like 5 minutes to try to find out if I can get him..but it isnâ€™t possible and his turn comes and he drains for like 4 and Occ. damge of 2 and then I am down to 9 cards. I drain and that is game...
