<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Start ISB operations with the Coruscant System.  Use Prepared Defences to pull out Oppresive Enforcement, Something Special Planned for them, and mobilization points. First turn you always need to pull out a system from Reserve Deck using mobilization points, this helps to give you early force generation.  Coruscant gives you an early drain were opponent has no icons.  When you begin to play this deck though your first concern always needs to be to make sure that you can stop your opponent from force draining while drawing up to find systems and ships.  If your opponent is playing a space deck against you, you can you the probe droids as forfeit in space. Also, when you drop the fourth ISB agent you flip the objective which allows you to retrieve your isb agents every turn.  This allows you to use people a multiple number of times.  Also the ties add to the force retrieval so there is more cards coming back and being used over and over. Another up side of the deck is that when your opponent tries to kill you undercover probe droids, you can just play oh, switch off so they canâ€™t be killed this turn.  If your opponent is not ready to come in space then this should be an easy victory for you.  Towards the end of the game play the abyssin ornament to retrieve 6 or 7 force from the probe droids.	This deck just chills with undercovers on the ground and star destroyers in space.â€™</p>
