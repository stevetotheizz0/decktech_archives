<p>Object of deck
First turn, you pull the D*2DB, Emperor (deployed to DB), Emperorâ€™s Power, and Wakeelmui.  Second turn, youâ€™re activating at least 8 Force and are ready to roll.
This deck is a basic TIE deck w/ a BHBM twist.	Flipping the objective is non-essential, but can be done.
The setup is to get out all your systems (draw for them), then park Palpy at the Throne Room.  This allows you to add a battle destiny w/ Emperorâ€™s Power everywhere.  With this, you could also park the Presence Of The Force and Vader there to get around Battle Plan and to make your opponent lose to Your Destiny.
The virtue of the deck is in not taking much Force drain damage.  Dreaded Imp Starfleet will save 1 drain w/ an Interceptor, Tarkinâ€™s Orders will cancel drains related to systems you control and can cancel any little surprises, and ATWYS will make your opponent miss his characters.
After getting at least 2 Interceptors per system, youâ€™ll be all set.  Your opponent will expire shortly after absorbing your big drains plus Your Destiny damage.	This deck has a winning differential of between 20-40.
Fighter Cover is in simply to get around opponentâ€™s Admiralâ€™s Order, plus can give your cannon-equipped TIEs a boost in power and ability to kill off opponentâ€™s starfighters.
The Dreadnaught should help in a pinch buy boosting power and ferrying TIEs wherever they need to be.
The numbers angle of this version of the deck isnâ€™t a necessity, but quite unexpected.  Frustration can work in conjunction with this to get some low-destiny cards on table.
Retrieval engine for this deck is Sienar Fleet Systems and Short-range Fighters.</p>

<p>Against a space deck, you are assured to win a large percentage of battles thanks to All Power To Weapons, Emperorâ€™s Power and Lateral Damage.
Against a ground deck, all you need to contend with are the drains, which you can easily cancel.  Your drains should eat away at your opponent faster then their drains that get through the canceling.  You shouldnâ€™t have to go to ground, but if you see a hole in their defense, Vader (if not already on table) can make short work of them and make them stack one on Insignificant Rebellion. â€˜</p>
