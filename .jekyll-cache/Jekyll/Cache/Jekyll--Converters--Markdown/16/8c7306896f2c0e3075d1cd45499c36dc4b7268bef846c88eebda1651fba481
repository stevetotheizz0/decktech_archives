<p>If the deck aint broken my english is</p>

<hr />

<p>Well lets see this deck starts with frozen han so it gets rid of stuper falcon and then with some good tracking you set up epic deuls and place obi out of play and cross luke so he kills his master then they have no one left. This is an update of carbon testing beats so look that up for more info. Basic track epic and use janus to set up destiny, flip for retrievel and dont worry about scum cause its not based on that so dont go</p>

<p>1 star- you dont have enough aliens to benefit from objective and that cause thats not what its about. If they have Ill take the leader and your obj is flipped iggy and zuckuss is immune to attrition less than 6 which is cool. bossk is four so its a pain to get rid cause you have sim. Track the scanning crew and use janus so they have no rebels and search and destroy rocks I think I need a ability x 3 and a lateral damage so Ideas to take out would be good. the holonet is in there cause everyone has a ooc/tt and it cancels it so screw them so does this is some rescue. a counter assault would be nice too.</p>

<p>originally did have corporal presscott for retrieving at prison any ideas to put him in would be good too then I would have option not to flip and caridia retrieves him into hand. thats it really it does win its tested im like</p>

<p>5-1 with it so far. IAO is just in case they flip me with profit. â€˜</p>
