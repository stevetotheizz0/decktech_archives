<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>STRATEGY</p>

<p>The strategy is easy. Well for start you get Carida with Mobibization Point, then u search for DSII- DB and the Emperor, i usually deploy the emperor at the DSII-DB for more force generation. Then iâ€™ll pretty much wait for the opponent to initiat something, and then i start deploying guys.  Remember you must win battle in order to turn luke, so keep your offensive back, and release it when the moment is right.</p>

<p>Profit</p>

<p>Put Mara and Dannik at the audience chamber, search for her stick if not there move them to jabba palace,and start draining. Jabba Palace is a better place to stand cause u can use your walkers there, and plus if he doesnâ€™t have guys there you can drain.</p>

<p>Degobah</p>

<p>Against Degobah i usually start with resistence cause most of the times they play with anger fear aggression. The Strategy is easy, just drain for alot.</p>

<p>Hidden Base</p>

<p>Start Draining as much as u can untill he flips, after that deploy your ships and probe, and fight him in space.</p>

<p>EBO</p>

<p>Enforce the ground with your characters, and try to cancel EBO, but is not going to be a quick thing is gonna take time.  Play resistence to make lower your opponents force drains, and fight in space only if u know u are going ot win. â€˜</p>
