<p>ADMIRALâ€™S ORDER (1)
Concentrate All Fire â€˜</p>

<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Concentrate on 1 or 2 systems. You should be able to win all battles in space against most decks. Try to wait as long as possible with the flip. Order To Engage is a must.</p>

<p>Because of Hidden Base with retrieval it is possible to win with 1 or no cards in Lost Pile.</p>

<p>Do, Or Do Not is currently the only SA protection, beacuse of the retrieval posibilities.</p>

<p>Strike Planning is there just for the force. If opponent play Endor Operations, donâ€™t start with Strike Planning, but with Aim High or no third Effect.</p>

<p>Your Insight Serves You Wellâ€™s main purpose is to get Aim High or Honor Of The Jedi.</p>

<p>Aim High power +5 in battle and helps when playing TIEs.</p>

<p>Intruder Missiles  Try to keep them from table, thus only deploying them in your turn before a battle or as a â€™reactâ€™ to a battle.</p>

<p>Concentrate All Fire  Ships power +3 and a better change of hitting ships.</p>

<p>A-wing	 stops â€™reactsâ€™ (Sword, Shield), can be exchanged for another starship</p>
