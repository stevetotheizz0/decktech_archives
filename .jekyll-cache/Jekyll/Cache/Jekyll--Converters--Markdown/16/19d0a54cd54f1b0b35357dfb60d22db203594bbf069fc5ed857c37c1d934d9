<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>I know this isnâ€™t the most popular objective, but I think it can be fun to play.	The idea, of course, is to freeze quickly and get the captive to the Audience Chamber.	The Ugnaughts and Ugloste should make the first half rather easy.  For the second, youâ€™ll need someone powerful enough to get them all the way there.	I usual donâ€™t even begin freezing until I have either Mara Jade or Jodo Kast there, possibly Ree-Yees if heâ€™s wearing armor.	If theyâ€™re playing Tatooine you can use the skiffs to quickly cross to the Audience Chamber, otherwise theyâ€™re forfeit fodder.  I use Jabba the Hutt because of his ability to generate force, which can be useful in deploying the bounty hunter ships.
This deck doesnâ€™t need to flip, but it has a much better chance of winning by a high differential if it does.	Besides protecting Scum and Villainy, you get force retrieval plus protection for all the bounty hunter ships.	Dark Maneuvers is in there to give IG-2000 and Punishing One the extra speed to get from Kiffex to Kashyyyk if necessary, and Those Rebels Wonâ€™t Escape Us is to stop Landing Claw (Use it only if Scum and Villainy is out, so you can immediately retrieve it by starting a battle).</p>

<p>Against Hidden Base Start with Security Precautions.  Be wary of EPP characters interfering with the freeze/transport.</p>

<p>Against Ops Start with Battle Order.  Use Bubo to munch away.	Once youâ€™ve moved the frozen captive, send in a fighting force.</p>

<p>Against Mains/Test 2 Start with Crush the Rebellion.  Move only in large groups, especially when transporting the prisoner.</p>

<p>Against Revolver Start with Crush the Rebellion.  You have one Evader; assume they have a grabber, so save it for when you need it.  After that, protect Jabba because heâ€™ll help generate extra force.</p>

<p>Against Numbers Start with Resistance and donâ€™t worry about it.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s about it.  Hope you enjoyed it. â€˜</p>
