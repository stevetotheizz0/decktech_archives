<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>General Strategy</p>

<p>First turn use Audience chamber’s text to get out mighty Jabba, and power of the hutt to get boelo. Wait for them to come to Tatooine. If they don’t drain them with gailid and go get them where ever they are with your docking bays. IOf they come to tatooine use all your weapons to to capture and feed. bounty all you can. Hutt bounty han then use boba fett to take him to the dungeon and retrieve 18 force oh yeah that’s what daddy likes. If the person you have captured has a saber take him to the sarlac whos has a defence value of 12 istead of 5. use hidden weopons and capturing guns to get battle a lesser amount of people and capture the rest with all wrapped up.</p>

<p>Matchups</p>

<p>WYS Make them go on tatooine capture ect. Hutt bounty is especially efective against this deck because they will have alot of smugglers.</p>

<p>Prifit Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha your card is flipped right off the bad pull your rancor and his den trap door han is placed out of play and you win</p>

<p>Hidden mains Space drain could hurt in this one, if space is popular in our area put in more space.</p>

<p>QMC Pull cloud city docking bay and make the colony not so quiet.</p>

<p>RST Pull endor docking bay and make sure the garrison will never be destroyed.</p>

<p>MWYHL let them train let them attack, let yourself capture everyone.</p>

<p>well thats it hope you like the deck</p>
