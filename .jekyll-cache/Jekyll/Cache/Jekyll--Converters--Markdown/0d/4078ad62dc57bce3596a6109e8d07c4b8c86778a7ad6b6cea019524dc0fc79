<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Get jabba the hutt down to the Audience Chamber as soon as possible pull the executor docking bay for better activation. Get scum &amp; villainy down. Deploy throughout jabbas palace and be ready to use your tricks to battle. Drain if they dont come to you early. if it looks like their never coming go get them. Your only weakness is space against strong pace decks. But dont worry you can hold your own in the right situation. Use your imperial barriers and None Shall Passes to their best advantage. Battle as much as possible to retieve with scum. Use the direct damage from the objective if they dont come down. This decks is not only powerful it is a blast to play.</p>

<p>Your Force</p>

<p>You will have plenty of force because of you (-) deploys because of Jabbas Sail Barge and Scum. Try to get your locations out as quick as possible.</p>

<p>Characters You have a a good amount of ground power to battle any ground deck. You can cancel game texts, Scancel battle destinys. Restrict deployment, and crush your opponent. No Worries in the character department.</p>

<p>Effects and Interrups Retrieve with Scum and First strike. Use your barriers and None Shall Passes to battle like a champ. Contol their force drains or stun their characters. If all else fails use Ghhk. Search for effects. No bargain restricts their deployment. Sniper their characters. Definietly no flaws here.</p>

<p>Locations You should have enough force and with gailid you can drain for a bunch at the palace. Good sites for battling. Jabbas Palace Pulls you sites and the audience chamber gets you an alien.</p>

<p>The best location you can get for a scum deck.</p>

<p>Starships and Vehicles The Sail Barge is great reduces your characters deploys and makes a few immune to attrition with Power of the Hutt. The Hunters ships work great against space decks. Get them together and beat down the rebel fleet. They better look out for Xixor on the Virago.</p>

<p>Weapons Weeeoooww Bzzzzzt and Vibro ax=bye bye obi.</p>

<p>Match Ups</p>

<p>VS. MWYHL Start secret plans to stunt their retrieval. Drain as much as you can early before they get set up. Use the objectives direct damage and kill him quickly. A tough matchup but you can pull it off.</p>

<p>VS. EBO DO lots of early damage before they are set up. Then use scum and your starships to battle like a champ in space drain on the groung while your killing and retrieving in space. Piece of Cake. Kinda</p>

<p>VS. Profit Start secret plans and battle, drain, and retrieve. Let them get han early then kill him and place him out of play. Grind them down while you retieve. Retiee while your draining and watch for beatdowns. Dont let them take the palace. This shouldnt be a problem with No Bargain, Barrier, None Shall Pass, and your awesome power. This game can be pulled of with a little concentration.</p>

<p>VS. Mains Use your tricks to battle like a champ. Ghhk their beatdowns. And cancel their deplyment. This deck can contol any mains deck with ease.</p>

<p>VS. Anything Else Battle, Retieve, and Force drain like a champ.</p>

<p>This deck is very good at killing rebels and of course winning</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and reviwing.</p>
