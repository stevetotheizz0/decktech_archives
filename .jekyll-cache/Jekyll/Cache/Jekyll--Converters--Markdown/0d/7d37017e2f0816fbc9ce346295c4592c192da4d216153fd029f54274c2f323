<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>There shouldn’t be much I have to say about this deck. It just plain rocks</p>

<p>I added some new characters. Lord Vader is cool. He is a god with his lightsaber. Godherdt can cancel Landing Claw, Sarkli is a spy and stops force generation on opponent’s 2/0’s, and Chiraneau adds to space drains and is an excellent pilot.</p>

<p>The new ships are good Flagship and Chimera.</p>

<p>There is a new start for this deck. Use prepared defences to probably pull IAO, Oppressive Enforcement and You Cannot Hide Forever.</p>

<p>The Admiral’s Order kicks ass in this deck. Stops crazy mains drawing extra destinies at Ralltiir, and pulls combat vehicles.</p>

<p>Overall I still think that RallOps will continue to dominate and has only been made stronger with DS2.’</p>
