<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>â€”UPDATE Since Palpy has no real way to be pulled, if heâ€™s lost, then the Force Lightnings are somewhat useless, so take out 3 of them for 1 Darth Vaderâ€™s saber, 1 Maulâ€™s saber, and 1 Mara Jade, The Emporerâ€™s Hand and sheâ€™s a *.â€”</p>

</ul>

<p>This deck is made to be broken since You?re A Slave? if used right can be a broken card. First turn, pull Executor- (Mob. Points) and Watto - (Junkyard) from Reserve Deck, put down Watto at the Junkyard and if you have a * character in your hand, hopefully Vader with Stick, put him down at Mos Espa, (if you have Admiral Piett, pull Merejek and next turn pull Tatooine). Flip. Then put down Executor face down, your opponent eithier loses 2 force and ther goes Executor down to the Used Pile and Opponent loses 2 Force. If he allows you, yipee You just put down a free Executor Now shuttleup Piett and Merjek if the previous scenario set out. Repeat with your ground based characters to bone up your defense on Tatooine, Vader With Saber goes to the Junkyard and the PS?s too. Darth Maul and the rest of the Ground Based characters go to Mos Espa. Use Fighters Coming In to save the bounty hunter ships. This deck is almost broken, if not already, using the Objective to pull out Imperial Starships that usually take aroun 8 Force to pull down and using the opponent?s Force as your own if he saved any, otherwise, you?re deploying at your own cost, but otherwise, use some ICSD?s to make your opponent lose 2 Force if he used all of his Force his last turn. Just drain and make him give you free ships and characters or make him lose 2 Force a turn. Draining is simple since your deck?s cards are high power and are pretty much unstoppable when all put down. Hidden Base should fall to tis ideal. And EBO is probably a drain race you?ll win. Profit may be a problem, if all else fails, shuttle up your characters or just transit to docking bays and drain. Pretty much sound strategy. Thank You.  â€˜</p>
