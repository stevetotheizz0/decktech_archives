<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>Strategy
Heres a tricky deck. Its not the ultime power of all tournaments but should do fine anywhere. Surprise is one of its main weapons.</p>

<p>It usually takes a straight forward strategy. You do your thing as fast as you can and go on draining. Then wait for your opponent and react. Gailid and Mosep are a deadly combo (specially if opponent likes drawing too many cards) and once youve got Bib on table (pretty easy) Niktos will react to battles (at very cheap prize)</p>

<p>You should not go too far away Jabbas home since there resides your strengh. Anyway LS decks have got a special attraction for this place so they will come to you (great).</p>

<p>Here are your enemies
VS Profit Deploy M. Jabba and Chall (and take the Engineer to hand). Convert Jabbas Palace and get Audience Chamber. You can take almost anything you need really fast. Look Ability, he cannot deploy every single turn. Dont forget Bib and Niktos reacting. Funny win</p>

<p>VS TIGIH If he comes to fight hes dead. If  he stays and tries to drain hes dead. Easy win.</p>

<p>VS HB (X-Wing swarm) spread all over Tatooine and drain as much as possible. Make sure you can avoid a beatdown (reacting is nice). Your skiffs will help a ton outside Jabbas house. Sec. Once youve got Hutt Influence youre on the right way. Try and get Sec. Prec and S&amp;D as fast as you can. If necessary get Jabba to space and probe. You win.</p>

<p>VS Hidden Mains I love fighting mains. Reacting is cool  and Wounded Wookie is a must You can take your Niktos from lost pile so you can take serious damage and take your happy aliens back. Play carefully and win.</p>

<p>VS EBO One word Resistance. Let S&amp;D, Gailid and Mosep do their job. Win</p>

<p>VS MWYHL same as above but try to grab On/Off the Edge. Take care.</p>

<p>VS Agents Great fun. Inside the Palace you can beat them (thanks Bubo) and outside your Skiffs (and weapons) will make the difference.</p>

<p>VS Speeders Double Laser Cannon will break their souls. Try to Control their Sandwhirls and youll be safe.</p>

<p>Please let me know any disadvantages you find. And remember I would not take it to a tournament but it can win almost anyone. Thanks
