I"»+<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Heloo there folks, it&amp;#8217;s me eric hunter reporting form kashyyyk on a tournament held in fitchburg, run by steve anderson.please exscuse my lack of grammar and speeling. so anywho here is the pre tourney rap.
<br />
<br />
so along time before we the tournament Kyle Craft calls my bro hayes, he says dude i bought a ticket on price line to come over on thursday and leave on tuesday. so hayes is like ok iâ€™ll tell my parents. so parents are like u shoulda asked first and all that shiz-nat but once hayes tells them he already bought the ticket there like okay.
<br />
<br />
fast forward to a week before the tournament.
<br />
so i have 4 decks made, my isb scum, a halfway completed dark surgeon, a trm that kills mkos, and a wys beats. jared greenwald comes over and we play test. i use my mkos killer against his mkos. and well i do what my deck is supposed to do an covert his jp first turn with my 3jpâ€™s and 2 tunnels. from their i win by like 40. i then play against his isb space with my wys beats. however i made all these crazy changes before cause my deck focused more on ground. i had played winklehaus online prior to this game and i knew what changes to make. so anywho we start playing and i get a ship into space and he just saves force and tries to beat me down. i barier and then i come down, powerpivot, outrider, bad feeling, he loses everything plus a bunch. and i win easy and think this is a kool deck. So later that weak i play against my broâ€™s state decks. i first play with the aotbs and win by 30 cause of my good draw. then i play against his mkos with my wys beats and i smack him in space while drain on the ground and i win by 20. So iâ€™m like kool and i decide to play both decks for the tournament. anywho i have only 2 emps so i get to borrow 4 off of steve baroni and paul maholick.however steve dosenâ€™t go so i only have 4 emps for the tournament. so i just nod my head and play. however in the morning i wake up and shower and stuff and tape the digimon season finale(i have no cable and i like anime so suck it), i go and well on to the tournament.
<br />
<br />
8 people including t directer so thatâ€™s not so hot. mike shiemer is the only other notable. ooh yeah my bro annd kyle craft went to albany to help twiggs for states and play on sunday and do a L5r tournament saturday so they werent there.
<br />
<br />
my decks.
<br />
vader why u being a playa hata?- my dark surgeon
<br />
a jediâ€™s got to do what a jediâ€™s got to do- wys beats
<br />
<br />
game 1 vs steve andersonâ€™s scouts and baragwins.
<br />
he starts insurection, staging areas and strike planning so iâ€™m like heâ€™s playing deadbolt or ansb mains. so i take a risk and go for the fast flip with spaceport db cause thatâ€™s what i decided to do against ebo decks. anywho he gets scout han and crix and a baragwin with narshada. so i tihnk either itâ€™s a deadbolt with baragwins or some mains thing. he puts down crix at the echo db he pulled and pulls a scout, bezzer. so i activate and objective and drain while i enforce xizor and draw looking for emperor. he goes and i finaly firgure out it is a scout deck with baragwins. i activate do damage and draw. he gets some scouts to endor db and letâ€™s me go. i just put down emp and move guri xizor and punks to his endor db where he has scouts. so i am winning cause of early damage and no luke has shwon up. he just getâ€™s more guys out(chewie and han, etc.) and eltâ€™s me go. i know he has fallen portal but i put down some guys and battle he fallen portals taking out xizor and djas puhr, caneling the battle. from there itâ€™s a drain and batttle race, it takes me a while to get xizor out again, but i eventualy pull out a win with 5 minutes left.

highs: he played a good deck, taking me by surprise for the first few turn, he also played well though slow.
<br />
lows: fallen portal
<br />
<br />
i watch the remaining game between mike sheimer and jeremy crusco. mike has his "undeafeated" huntdown admirals that i have beaten in playtesting though he denies it. well crusco has a really killer light profit deck and has a timed win by 13 or so.
<br />
<br />
game 2 vs paul maholicks retardous rexatardo isb thing(brina hunters isb space)
<br />
well he gets a good start with merijek going down to executer db and he gets out fondor. i just activate and draw i think. he just activates and draws. i get out outrider, dash and arto to tat system while holding a barrier. he activates and draws some more so i know he has exucter coming down soon. so i drain and put down talon with outrider while drawing. he gets the exucter and guys to endor and flips and draws. i drain flip objective in space and we start draining. he eventualy getâ€™s chiranue and i decide to set up menace. ii play chewie with gun against his isb droid, however i have arto and c-3p0 out so i battle and take him out. so anywho he puts down arica to block my ground drain. we are just draining and running around. we have a battle in spaace where i am down by 30 but cause of tallon and objective i handle it easy. so we are draining and i make a few attemps to smack him on ground but none resolve with overflow. however i evetntualy smack the exucter via powerpivot by like 42 but he handles it plus 8 cards. form there i out drain him.

game 3 vs jeremyâ€™s aotbs direct damage deck.
<br />
well he plays fears and stuff while i drain in space and have luke out. he make attemtps to cature luke with djas and dengarâ€™s gun, however i dodge out of that. i then smack djas for 4 overflow and i continue to drain. he gets out a few guys at lukes site and takes him out but he leaves bane in on jabbaâ€™s barge. i play han to the bardge and luke to the &lt;&gt; db and battle, bad feeling, triple, he loses everything plus like 8. form there i just out drain him and win.

game 4 vs mike schiemers hbmains.
<br />

<br />
i go to get a db but i canâ€™t find the curscant one so i get spaceport and move him over, i look in my force pile and see bad feeling have and i draw up leaving no defense for xizor. he gets out degabah and a db, ditching yisyw for honor but dosenâ€™t deploy it, he then draws up. i activate then monok, taking out 2 epp leiaâ€™s. i do 2 damage, get a db, and put bad feeling. emp comes to join xizor and he goes. I am just doing damge and setting up, i get a huge hand since he dosenâ€™t play grimtash and i get set up, giving emperor and xizor a little more support.since i give only 1 force and bad feeling is out he is choked. so he puts jedo luke to home 1 db for 7 and a saber joins him, i barrier him so he canâ€™t move to his spaceport db. i activate and do damage and send bosk into space to do more damage. he finaly gets luke and some guys to his db but i donâ€™t care iâ€™m ahead. i monok again and take out 4 more card i think, 2 of which where edges. i play no escape to get it back and i drain, getting ready. he moves everybody over to my &lt;&gt; db. i activate play 4-lom with gun, bane malar, boba fett with gun, a vigo and battle. he fallen portals the vigo,i copy hans gmae text, i i have u now. he excludes 4-lom, he hits xizor, i shoot han. i then draw my 5 destinies for a total of 21. so when the dust clears i have emperor and 4-lom i tihnk, and he has twass and melas. he then plays wedge and beru and husband and battles. i just lose 4-lom he loses a few charecters. fomr there we just fight back in forth and i get stinger to yodaâ€™s hut and i finaly do more damage to him then he can handle.

anywho first turn i get theron nett and his ship with cannon to tatione, while holding a barier. i make sure we lose to visage cause i may lose a important interupt that i can use. we i get 2 smuggelers at the cantina to flip, but he comes down with 4-lom and xizor and battles. i just lose the RFC. i come down with luke and mirax and battle he loses them and 4 i think. so we are bothe losing to visage but iâ€™m ahead cause of drains in space. so anywho he comes in space and i barrier. i play melas in red squad 1, and battle. bad feeling, power pivot, he loses everything. from there i get kessel out and drain in space. i also drain on ground while running fomr his mains. he thne deploys a lone SD to his caridia. i deploy outrider, dash, and talon, battle reduce, i draw a total of 9 for he loses 8. i just then drain him out after 2-3 on the edges.

<br />
<br />
game 6 vs. paul laudenbachâ€™s ebo x-wings.
