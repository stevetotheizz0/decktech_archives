<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p><em>** Quick Note **</em> One of “Luke Skywalker’s” in the deck lis is actually a “Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.” I caught the mistake after I submitted the deck.</p>

<p>This is my first attempt at building a MWYHL deck since the release of Death Star II.  With the help of The Way Of Things, this deck is super-fast.  The three effects I usually start with are Wise Advice, The Way Of Things and Your Insight Serves You Well.  I train Daughter of Skywalker so that I can have Jedi Luke and Obi-Wan with the rest of the gang duke it out on the ground.	I chose the Endor sites because General Solo, CoK and Luke all deploy fairly cheap there.  Also, it gives me some battlegrounds to occupy to satisfy Come Here You Big Coward to insure that I can retrieve my force after I finish Jedi Test #5.  The Eloms are huge, as they are power 4 with an Imperial.  Thus they give Hunt Down, Bring Him Before Me, and Ralltiir Decks fits.  The deck is pretty self-explanitory other than that.  There are 4 destiny 7’s in the deck, and I’ve never had a problem pulling one for Jedi Test #5.	Thanks in advance to everyone who takes the time to review this.
