<p>whoops, add in a vibro axe.  It got lost in the translation from paper to text.</p>

<p>This is a ground battle deck.  Back up Xizor (Guri is nice) and get him to a battle ground.  Use your interrupts and weapons to capture all the LS characters.  Capturing Luke will probably win you the game.  If he is not on the table, you are getting huge attrition bonuses and you can capture people with all wrapped up.  After you have wiped out their ground forces, use direct damage and force drains to kill them.  Your objective makes tracking easy, and makes Bossk with gun good again.  If they are playing space, use resistance to limit their drains and use Search and Destroy and your objective to do damage.  Against HB, get out security precautions and find their base.  Watch out for fallen portal, and try to grab it.  Just beat him up on the ground.  ‘</p>
