<p>Objective (1)
There Is Good In Him/I Can Save Him  â€˜</p>

<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Opponentâ€™s first turn pull Crix &amp; Solo w/ Strike Planning.</p>

<p>Your first turn pull the Tatooine DB 94. Deploy Crix and pull Chewie of K. (If you have enough Force).</p>

<p>Next turn put down General Solo and pull out Corporal Midge. Try to get Honor of the Jedi and Lightsaber Proficency out fast. Spread out on Endor with your scouts (pull one each turn) and start draining for alot with sabers/Midge. Control Back Door so you donâ€™t give them a drain of 2.</p>

<p>Even if they do get off a FD or 2, just Lost in the Wilderness â€™em and they will have to @#$% about to get the character back.</p>

<p>Cancel their reacts w/ Beezer, and make â€™em deploy +4 w/ Goo Nee Tay and Kensaric. Page adds to your destinys and General Solo lets you cancel.</p>

<p>Get Ben out at Tatooine and let him have some fun with his saber and maybe Tawss Khaa to soak up any Battle Damage you run into.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t yet have the cards to build this deck. But Iâ€™m trying, it looks like a great deck to play.</p>
