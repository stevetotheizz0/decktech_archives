<p>Objective
ISB Operations/Empire’s Sinister Agents  ‘</p>

<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>The objective almost always is flipped by turn 3. Using IAO get one docking bay out each turn, 1st get hoth DB, then Yavin DB, then Endor DB, then whatever you like. Deploy any of the locations if you get them in your hand and make sure when you deploy your characters each site can draw a battle destiny. With Battle Order, ABC2Uni and Imperial Decree and 5D6 their drains will be expensive for a maximum drain of 1. If they beatdown play ghhk (be mindful of Draw Their Fire) and watch out for grimtash with the droids and ghhks. Get Stalker + Piett to the Endor system for easy to get cheap deploy droids. Remember to retrieve an ISB each draw phase and use Abyssin Ornament with the droids. ‘</p>
