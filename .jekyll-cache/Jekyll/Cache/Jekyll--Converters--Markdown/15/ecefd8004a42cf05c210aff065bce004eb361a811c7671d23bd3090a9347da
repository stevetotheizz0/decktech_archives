<p>Strategy: ‚Äò</p>

<p>ok, before i start to tell you my style to play this deck, i want to say somethin‚Äô</p>

<p>‚ÄúTHIS IS NOT A TEN NUMB SUPERSTAR DECK‚Äù</p>

<p>i like the winkelhaus style but this is my own creation, of course their are some similar cards, but this</p>

<p>is always the same in QMC decks.</p>

<p>so, first i just play 2 locations to flip my objective after 2/3 turns cause then it rocks if you play to much</p>

<p>locations or docking bays, you will lose cloud city sites and so you will lose da game Try tp pull out fast</p>

<p>Han and Chewie with Falcon, i don‚Äôt paly Life Dept cause i play enough ships like the great ‚ÄúRedemption‚Äù if you pull</p>

<p>out this ship with bacta tank you will never lose bespin system, but it took me always 5 or 6 turns tp pull out</p>

<p>Bacta and Redemption. you can also keep bespin clean with Wedge, and his X-Wing Cannon, don‚Äôt deploy the cannon,</p>

<p>just use Rapid Fire, and Zuckuss will be kicked from bespin. The most important fact is to keep the bespin system but with Power</p>

<p>Pivot and some funny Interuder Missles &amp; Ten Numb, you will also beat down a Exe.</p>

<p>Try to deploy Leia and Pucumir to flip the objective, with Path ‚Ä¶ you will keep them alive and Houjix will stop</p>

<p>any f.ucking beat downs on cloud city, if you flip your objective play battle paln as the defensive shield, and try to deploy the</p>

<p>Bespin Celebration</p>

<p>My Style against Winkelhaus</p>

<ol>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<p>Most players, pull out ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Take The Leader‚Äù ok thats fine, but‚Äù Concentarte All Fire‚Äù is just better</p>

<p>1 example, all ya aliens are immune to atrrition &lt;6, also each wepaon draw is +1, so with Colo Claw Fish you will always hit</p>

<p>a Vader or Maul also With EPP Leia, so don‚Äôt play ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Take The Leader‚Äù cause if you play this you also must play 1 db.</p>

<ol>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<p>The second think is Goo Nee Tay, if pull out this effect, opponent will never deploy more then 1/2 powerful mains to</p>

<p>cloud city, example +2 with Goo Nee Tay and +1 for Bespin game text, so +3 for every dangerous character, damn.</p>

<ol>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<p>Play only 1 Off The Edge cause every good dark pllyer will kick your second Off The Edge, and so just play it at the end</p>

<p>with A Few Maneuvers.</p>

<p>So This was my QMC, Winkelhaus played this deck like nobody else, he just rock all da @sses with his QMC, and it‚Äôs</p>

<p>amazing  But i think my way to play this deck is alo not to bad, or????????????</p>

<p>Thx to all who read/rated my QMC deck</p>
