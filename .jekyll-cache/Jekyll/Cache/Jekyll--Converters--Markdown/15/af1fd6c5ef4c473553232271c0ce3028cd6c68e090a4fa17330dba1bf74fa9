<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>In my first turn I seach+deploy EBG and Echo war
room then i search for one of the guys then i draw.
on the second turn i search for a guy and any
remaining cards i need to complete EBO then i
complete EBO (unless there is not enough force or
for some reason i cant get the cards), I leave any
remaining force in my farce pile. on my third turn
i deploy large amounts of B-wings and test out my
opponents fleet(if they have one).on my fourth turn
when i usually have more force i deploy more
expensive high powered ships and weapons and crush
my opponents.I continue to do so until my opponent
 is crushed then i drain them to death. i use my
 ground for unexpected attacks or to hold an
important site from my opponent.
	I use b-wing bombers because of pilot capacity
for extra power and DS iâ€™ll take da leader and +3
ion destiny. I use ion cannons for defense of my
bombers(kills opponents weapons), to make my opponent
defense0 for an easy hit and to stop them from
escaping. I use commander wedje and luke because i
can pull them from reserve deck to help complete
EBO faster and because they are good pilots.
THANKS FOR READING MY DECK    â€˜</p>
