<p>EDIT** OK the comp is over, but still review this deck for what it is, a good deck that can compete well post R3 without any R3 of its own.</p>

<p>EDIT2** in response to reviews i would not use ‚ÄôStormtrooper Garison‚Äô because it is far to much to deploy compared to a another normal unique trooper who can get up to almost as much power. trooper assault is ok with them, but it only adds 2 to power, no more. and it‚Äôs destiny doesn‚Äôt really help this deck. so no iwould not use it, it is just to much to deploy, i mean old crinkly palpy is cheaper.</p>

<p>EDIT3** i‚Äôd just like to thank you all who have seen the true (sic)ness of this deck. and i‚Äôd like to give a big up yours to the 2 b1tches who gave this deck a half and a 2.</p>

<p>Hi all, this is the deck I have been using in the last 4 tournaments, leading up to and during the release of R3 and has performed excellently. In those tournaments I went 1st, 2nd, 4th (bad Ls deck at this one), and 1st. It has very few weaknesses so I‚Äôve decided to share it with you all and see what you think (besides I haven‚Äôt posted a deck in AGES). It is has beaten all the major LS decks in the current environments, including WYS, R3 objective, QMC, Profit, Mains, Hidden base and RST. Ok this is how it plays</p>

<p>Early game Pull your 2 interior B/G from reserve and activate. Since this deck has 11 icons of it‚Äôs own, all of which should be on the table by 2nd turn, activation particularly during the early game is very nice. Deploy your sites and use the objective to search for a card. Always pull Cloud City into hand and unless your playing WYS deploy it straight away. While your there grab the DB with IAO/ combo that you deployed as your secret plans with the objective. Also grab evader/monnok (you‚Äôll probably need this asap).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Draw the first turn and on your second activate a lot and play lost monnok (if the opponent drew more than 12 play a used in his turn and then pull it out again.) if he has no real offense you might want to drop 3 troopers to 3 different sites drop a ship to CC after grabbing DarkDeal from reserve. However, if he has some big main characters play more conservatively, wait to build up a force of troopers with some protection. It this case I would wait till I had at least 1 or 2 trooper assaults deploy some troopers and a ship for DD them move the troopers together and if need be land the ship where the troopers are (this may be turn 3-4). If he hasn‚Äôt done any thing to stop you on his next turn drain him for 6-10 force (best case scenario)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mid game  it‚Äôs around this time most good players will think ‚ÄúI‚Äôd better do something to stop the big drains I‚Äôm gonna take in the a$$ next turn‚Äù and try to do something. It would be unlikely that he‚Äôll just charge head long into your characters (unless he‚Äôs playing suicide mains) he‚Äôll try to either try to do his own game (which might include setting up Menace Fades) or try and cancel DD by occupying 4 bespin locations. If he leaves you alone to do his own thing (i.e. in a ‚Äòwe‚Äôll handle this‚Äô game) you will out drain him. That‚Äôs it. Just spread with the appropriate protection. Set up CC occupation. And maybe send EPP vader on a suicide run to slow him down.</p>

<p>If he sets up M/F you must play more slowly, take time to set up. In this scenario you can take control of Bespin System and either get CC occupation going if that‚Äôs all it takes, or deploy Black Sun Fleet. This way you can move Bossk or Zuckuss in front of his system in your control phase to prevent him satisfying M/f and drain him as normal. Drains of 10+ will knock him over Real quick like. Once you flip he can‚Äôt cancel your drains either. If he comes to you to cancel DD play tactical support to get 3 troopers, you should have at least another in hand, probably Vader aswell. drop em on his weakest location , battle. First strike helps. Trooper assault. That‚Äôs at least 15-22 power + 4 from DD + destiny. That should clear him out. Once you have removed him redeploy dark deal.</p>

<p>Late Game By now you have either beat him down or drained him down (unless something has gone Horribly, horribly wrong) to the point where can no longer really pound on you so spread out to all available sites with at least 2 troopers and maybe an trooper assault or some thing. DD should provide extra protect through its power bonus. Don‚Äôt do anything stupid though unless you have your ghhhk in hand. Stick to that formula and everything should go smoothly.</p>

<p>Card Choices</p>

<p>Bewil; though he is not a trooper, he prevents opponents characters from moving away from him to a mobile site. This helps setting a massive trooper beating on Padme(or someone) when the lass has tried to cancel DD and finds she can‚Äôt pi$$ off 2 another site</p>

<p>Cadets less power, but cheaper and can be forfeited to satisfy all attrition should the need arise</p>

<p>Interceptors &amp; Lasers just about the only way of killing off the completely broken card ‚ÄòHan, Chewie in Falcon‚Äô. They can shoot twice, just make sure they hit Or it could get real nasty. There is 3 cards (2x Imp. Command &amp; D. maneuvers) that can be easily tracked for the sure hit, if your not inclined to track like a pro. Also helps against WYS/QMC ships.</p>

<p>Grabber essential in every deck, grab abusive interrupts (V. vision etc), sense, retrievers. At the very least grab a high destiny used interrupt it‚Äôs a card for card ratio.</p>

<p>Wipe them out all of them. just so you can still play trooper assault in case of IdidIt, Frozen assets or beggar, though these cards will be few and far between now.</p>

<p>Black Sun Fleet anti menace fades as explained above</p>

<p>Tactical support losing 2 cards voluntarily is not to appetizing but it sure helps setting up massive Trooper beats, gets Enfield and torent who add destiny together</p>

<p>I‚Äôd just as soon kiss a wookiee yeah, its errataed and crappy now, but you can‚Äôt use barrier so this is the next best thing. Helps separate beating crews and pilots from ships. i.e. divide and conquer</p>

<p>Odds protection ok inserts is dead. the shields have killed em. thats what i thought until last tournament richard barton stuck me with an AFA of course i actually didn‚Äôt have any R3 so it popped b4 i could do anything about it anyway, projective is in the deck 4 AFA. as far as numbers are concerned, any deck using odds wouldn‚Äôt be very aggressive so i think just rely on the troopers destiny of 3 making a total of 9 to soften the damage. at the very worst you can play i‚Äôd just as soon kiss a wookiee to bounce it back until next turn, giving you time to do something.</p>

<p>MATCH UPS</p>

<p>WYS still the deck to beat. This one is not really that hard, stunning leader in the cantina can end the game in one turn, though this will get less and less likely as this card becomes more common in the R3 obj. decks. M. fades hurts but can be got around. Even with out dark deal occupation should put the nails in the coffin, just grab either Control/TV or edges. Also B/p is the bane of this deck but as long as you get to bespin system with and admiral on something (ideally chimera ) this should not hurt so much. Hey you can pay for it if need be. Also do not deploy cloud city till you have a ship to get DD on table in one turn. Other wise an early dash or wedge could be a real pain on the a$$. Thrawn protects your AO</p>

<p>Duel of the Fates( R3 obj.) really not that much of a worry either. Yeah they can set up quick with qui-gon and obi on their sites, but you can set up just as quick with and drain for twice as much. Their super mains will cost a fortune to deploy to Cloud city (+1 more if you control the system). The 4 force they give u at the start will mean lightning quick set up, and when Qui-gon is sitting alone at the Naboo core gen. Drop 4 troopers and Vader on him for a sh1t load of overflow. First strike is money in this match up. Even if they throw out the B/p shield you should have little resistance holding bespin with a minimum of ships (don‚Äôt leave obsidian 7 there holding his d1ck for han/chewie/falcon though) I played this match up against a good player in a tournament on Sunday and didn‚Äôt work up a sweat.</p>

<p>Hidden Base Monnok. Spread. Flip. No drain canceling. Sit at Bespin. Probe if your fell the need. Let occupation eat em up. Thrawn+chimeara = pie</p>

<p>TRM( mains) don‚Äôt spread out at all. Not even once. This is a tough match cause they will throw everything they‚Äôve got at you. Play very conservative. Draw up till you can establish yourself at bespin system. You‚Äôll need very force you can get. So start TINTOE but dive for WTOAOT for the extra activation during their turn. Once you have plenty of troopers deploy Dark Deal and occupation but moved on to 1 site. When they come have at least  2 trooper assaults cause it could get grabbed and sensed. Vader will be important to reduce the forfeit of their mains. You can really over power them with 6 troopers, vader, DD, ships at cloud city, but you gotta play smart. If you get god luck you might catch a scrub character like chewie, mirax, or some crap with stunning leader, ending the game in one turn, but this is unlikely. I‚Äôd just as soon kiss a wookiee, will help to bounce a character back to their hand allowing you to handle the smaller force. Crush will prevent more than 2 Battle destiny.</p>

<p>Alternatively if you monnok early and see they‚Äôve got no major force drop everything quick and get in some big drains b4 they can come after you, potentially causeing the lose of vital cards off the top. This strategy is uber risky. I‚Äôd just fight it out. Occupation will take its toll.</p>

<p>QMC Toughest match up. You will be hard pressed to get to bespin early and keeping DD on table will be next to impossible. B/plan will be your worst enemy. Just like playing mains, stay consolidated but don‚Äôt dump all your troopers to one location.. Try and catch pucumir with stunning leader. The Ties and laser will make or break you. Try track and shoot down dash, han/chewie/falcon. Let zuckuss and chimeara w/ ozzel take care of the rest. The key is winning bespin system. If you can do that the game is yours. Get occupation and cancel their celebration. Talon Roll is also an option should the opportunity arise. Ghhhk/TrWEU can cancel hyper escape too if they commit to early and you can challenge them will a couple ships.</p>
