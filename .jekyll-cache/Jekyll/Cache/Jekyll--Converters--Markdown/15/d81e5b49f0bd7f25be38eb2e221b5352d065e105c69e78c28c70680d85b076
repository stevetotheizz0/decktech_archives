<p>ISBâ€™</p>

<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>This is the deck Iâ€™ve been fooling around with.  Its a good deck, but has a weakness to Profitâ€¦ you gotta watch yourself against it.	I built this deck because I donâ€™t want to play BHBM or ROps.  This is original.</p>

<p>If you canâ€™t figure out the strategy you should go play YJ, because you obviously suck at this game.</p>

<p>Flip ISB with 2 ISBâ€™s at either dbay, flip and then move em the hell out of there.  Coruscant DBay is in over Ds2 DBay because Iâ€™d like to have another planet site for Decree.  The MMoves and SHUOD are in to kill the Tank and the Savrip.</p>

<p>Use ISB to retrieve an ISB, and then use Pol Treidum to smash an Undercover spy.</p>

<p>Uhh thats all I can think of right now. â€˜</p>
