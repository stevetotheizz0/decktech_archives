<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>First The Card Choices</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Ben Kenobi Yes he is very expensive but he can save your @#$% in most games when you dont want to lose a smugler. He is best when playing vs a court deck because with some chumps he can take the chamber.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a bad feeling about this This is a great card. My favorite thing to do is relocate Lateral Damage to Tatooine. This helps in most games. This also Won me the game I played vs Jamie Abel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power Pivot This is the bonus that WYS needs to win vs a imp command deck. The power pivots help vs any big space deck and you can play them at key times to make your oppenent lose a ton of force even when they play imp command.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To Win with this deck you dont really need the celebration but you do need to hold the system. Almost every game one of your Freighters and one of your x-wings with a cannon can hold a system with a power pivot in hand.</p>

<p>Turns</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Draw untill 12 but deploy effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take two smuglers to the bay, you can also use luke.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try to contol the system in this turn or the next. If you have the tank down one ship can hold it for a turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put down another ship and draw.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After this you just drain and retrive if you need to. Get out Projection and you wont lose much force. He will most likly come after you but you can take him in most cases.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Matchups</p>

<p>ISB This can be a long game but will belong to you in the end. If he comes to tatooine in space very hard but has another system that you can satisfy menace fades with go there. On the ground you will spank him badly. But dont go to him. Watch for tramples. Put Projection down. Power Pivot will hurt him very badly.</p>

<p>Hunt down This can be hard if he duels, but most dont and you can kill them easily. Space is all yours so Celebrate.If you see Deul cards dont put down Ben. Luke can hold his own with his stick. And you have very good destiny. He will have only 4 or 5 good characters so take them out with multiple destinys. Sometimes you can get lucky with an out of commision and get vader. ha ha  The big thing is to keep visage out of the game.</p>

<p>BHFM This is an easy game most of the time because he wont will battles and you will beat him in the duels if he takes luke. He he doesnt go back to the death star you must kill vader, fallen portal is big. Drain and you will win big. He wont do any damage with your big destinys.</p>

<p>Court Start Battle plan every time it will hurt him every time. Go to space first. Fallen portal,projection, and weapon lev are the keys to the game. Play them effectively and the game is yours.</p>

<p>My kind of scum Same as court fallen portal is your biggest help along with projection. Most of the time mid-game you will want to take the chamber with a @#$%-load of men.</p>

<p>Ties This is the biggest problem to WYS and you will most likly have to leave Tatooine because you must satisfy menace fades and battle plan, keep them off the ground and you should win in the end. Remember to use nobel sac it will help. I did beat this kind of a deck but only by 3 so it was a very close game.</p>

<p>Endor Ops This is a problem if they flip but most wont so drain away and use power pivot, keep menace fades in effect and the game is yours. Fallen portal is big again.</p>

<p>Every other objective is meat to this. Some decks can be not bad but one card people have in their decks doesnt make their deck able to beat this so dont review this and tell me that one card will screw this deck because I have seen every tech card for the DS and they dont match up with this style of WYS Abel even played the responsibility of command combo on me and I WON that game.   Also playing 1 people over  1800 and 2 people over 1900 rating proves this deck can kick ass, even the best players get hurt.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking time to read and Review</p>
