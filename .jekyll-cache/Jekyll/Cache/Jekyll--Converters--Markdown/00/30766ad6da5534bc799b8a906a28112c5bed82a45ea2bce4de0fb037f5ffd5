<p>STRATAGY
First turn try to get someone to the bunker to utilize Perimeter Patrol‚Äôs game text and keep those mains away. Then start spread draining using Perimeter Patrol (PP) to protect against REBEL (not aliens) beatdowns. The ghhhks and Imperial Barriers are to protect you in case something gets through PP. Now, get out Imperial Arrest Order, Pull Yavin 4 Docking Bay, and then get Organa‚Äôs Necklace on an Imperial. On the same turn move the Imperial over to Endor for some nice drains. Get some ships to Endor system and get that objective flipped. Now spread out and start draining BIG  This deck has some very good beat down and with the ‚ÄúBad Feeling Have I‚Äù, ‚ÄúNavy Trooper Fenson‚Äù combo the LS mains are deploy +4  There is incredible drain potential for this deck as you can drain for 5 on the Endor system &amp; up to 15 on Endor ground. This is a very fun deck as well as deadly.
