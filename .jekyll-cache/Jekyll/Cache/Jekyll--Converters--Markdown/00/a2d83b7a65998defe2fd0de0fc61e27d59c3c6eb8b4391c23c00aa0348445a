<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>The whole strategy behind this deck is that it should be able to win in more than one way, while holding up against the more popular LS objectives.  First, it can duel with Obsession and Circle if it happens, and with decent destiny draws, should do ok.  Now especially with Honor of A Jedi, dueling is out, so it needs other ways to win.	It has many powerful cards, and should hold up well in battles.  Due to site choice, PoF, and Expand, it should do quite well as a drain deck.	Some more strategy will be best shown by addressing specific cards…</p>

<p>Imperial Arrest Order get out that needed battle ground the first turn.  also prevent rude supprises if you end up spread out and draining.</p>

<p>Broken Concentration, He Is Not Ready, (The Signal) Make that cursed 1st test virtually impossible.  in a 14 player tournament i was recently in there were 4 training decks.	all did very well as there were none of these cards.</p>

<p>Sites, PoF X2, Expand, (Janus Grejatus/Emperor) Drains for 4/5/6.  ‘nough said</p>

<p>Destroyed Homestead, He Is Not Ready This deck is geared towards battle.  keep him from hiding or make him pay.</p>

<p>Omni Box Tracking destinies is just getting too popular and deadly.  plus it is a D5 and used. (take out that 7 for test 5)</p>

<p>Sense X3  either you love them or you hate them. cancel that arcona or tauntaun react.  when was the last time you saw that?</p>

<p>Sniper/Hutt Smootch Kill the weeny spy/ capture han or leia.  it is not good for your drains to be canceled</p>

<p>Plus Some Killer Combos</p>

<p>Ozzel/Blizzard 2 hold down a site for six force. power 8, destiny, immunity to attrition &lt;4</p>

<p>Vader,Tarkin,Jodo Kast Cancel TWO destinies if need be</p>

<p>So anyway… There you have it.  A deck that should display a great mix of offense, defense, and subterfuge.’</p>
