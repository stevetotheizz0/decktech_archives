<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure how to explain this one.
Should be pretty obvious from the cards.
Get a bunch of generation and Tunnel Vision to
setup the combos. The multiple Destinies can be
used to apply beatdown but I really wasnâ€™t able to
beatdown on anyoneâ€¦people donâ€™t spread out much
anymore.</p>

<p>Against everything you should start Wise Advice
unless your sure of NO Sac or small amount of
interrupts.</p>

<p>v. HDADTJ  Dueling Protection and Spies. Pretty
much solid here.</p>

<p>v. Ralltiir Ops  I had a tough time busting up
Ralltiir Ops but after 12 Luke/Obi strikes I was
able to do it ;) Iâ€™ll probably start adding Melas
and Bron Burs or something so I can combat this
decktype better.</p>

<p>v. Court  You can bring the Mains in with authority
Skywalkers cancels Imperial Barrier so you only
have to worry about None Shall Pass which you can
Grapple.</p>

<p>Anything Else  Manip protection , #s protection ,
Barrier stoppersâ€¦etc.
