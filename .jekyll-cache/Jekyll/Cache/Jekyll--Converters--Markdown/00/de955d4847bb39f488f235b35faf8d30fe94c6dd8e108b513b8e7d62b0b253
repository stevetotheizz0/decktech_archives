Well another tournament is set for the Lompocians to play, and Sean the Tournament Director emails me on Friday and asked if I am going to be there....hmmmmmmmm....one day to think about it and less time to put my decks together, what to do what to do...well since I had no plans for that Saturday I thought I would go to the game. So that night with my local friends we do are dinner and movie escapade. (Saw the D&amp;D movie, it was pretty good) so after alls said and done I get home at about midnight with enough time to do anything that I want and what I want is to watch 2 weeks of DBZ but alas I make my lightside deck for the tournament while watching about 1/2 of one tap...~sigh~ I will get the time sometime to watch the others.
<br />
<br />
Well Saturday morning rolls around and here I am half awake from only about 6 hours of sleep (yes only 6, but I love my sleep...so Pfffbbt) so I wake up do the morning stuff, look through my lightside deck one last time and grab the others and my trade fodder and head out for the nice 75 mile drive to play Star Wars.
<br />
<br />
I decide on the road that I am going to be playing for Lightside - Rescue The Princess and for Darkside - BHBM
<br />
<br />
When I get there I found out that the tournament director is there and that I was about 1 hour early ~exhasberated sigh -- I could have slept more~ so I sit in the game room and the TD Sean comes in and asks to play a game he wants to try out his deck so I grab my favorite BHBM deck that I am also going to use for the tournament and proceed to play...

Pre-Game vs Sean Campbell "Endor Scout Deck"
<br />
<br />
I start w/the normal, Death Star 2: Throne Room, Your Destiny, Insignificant Rebellion, Prepared Defense, Mobilization Points, Imperal Arrest Order, Oppressive Enforcement he starts the Endor Objective, Endor, Landing Platform, Heading For the Medical Frigate, Your Insight Serves You Well, Wise Advice and Squadron Assignments. So I start, draw my hand and then search my deck for Rendili, afterwhich I activate and getting 4 force to start instead of 3, I get the Emperor, Force Lightning and D*II:DB. Picking my hand I put out the Emp @ the DB and put Janus Greejatus there with him. They sit there for the rest of the game. His  first start he gets the usuall stuff out and Crix Madine and Calrissian w/Strike Planning that he deployed using Your Insight Serves You Well (which makes it way to the lost pile, then deploys Endor DB then says go. I activate, look through for the Endor DB and deploy it, along with Lord Vader and stick to the DB. Pick a few up getting ZIMH and DIPO, I say go. He activates, drop Calrissian to Endor on Gold Squadron 1, then he drops some random scrub and General Solo to Lord Vaderâ€™s site but doesnâ€™t battle. So on my turn I activate, I drop ZIMH, DIPO and use Janus Greejatusâ€™s ability (constantly recycling that Force Lightning - gotta love that) and get 4-LOM w/Gun so I drop him w/Vader, I also play First Strike and Battle Plan I then initate for free in space killing General Calrissin (stacking one), then I battle against General Solo and scrub (nixing Solos gametect) and stacking another. The game pretty much goes on like that I get most of the characters all over Endor and forcedrain him for most of the game while heâ€™s trying to set stuff up w/Tala 1 and Tala 2 to do something the Chimera and Dreadnaught w/Sarkili say no to that and I win w/25. However what did I learn while playing this game ... REMEMBER TO MAKE HIM LOOSE 3 a TURN for not having Luke at a BG...sheesh I remember once and he had him there...needless to say that didnâ€™t happen during the tournament. :)
<br />
<br />
Well the people started showing up, the standard people that are always at Lompoc tournaments and we set the pairings...my names called first, I take my seat and stay there the entire day (yeah nice and warm and comfy) I start Darkside...
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1 - Darkside BHBM vs Jeremy Naymiks EBO
<br />
<br />
Well I never like playing against EBO cause I donâ€™t have any room for Imperial Decree...so I figure I will start quick with the nine activation on the second turn and that happens as normal...I get Emperor to D*2:DB and say go. He deploys the normal start for EBO and then gets a couple of the sites and then tells me to go. So I activate get out the Endor DB and then drop Vader there w/Stick and Janus w/the Emperor and they sit there the entire game. I say go. He activates and gets more stuff and sets up more w/the EBO but doesnâ€™t complete it yet, getting Commander Luke Skywalker out for the Luke but doesnâ€™t w/my Obj does it with his card (canâ€™t remember the name off the top of my head) and doesnâ€™t deploy him and says go. So I make him loose 3, then I force drain for 2, then I Janus and get a ship (nice) then I draw a couple and get a couple more of the ships...(nice) then say go. He completes setting up EBO gets Hoth down and drops Haven there along with the Independces there as well as deploying Luke to the Power generator and tells me to go. Well I do and tell him to loose 3 force and he says Lukes on the table, I tell him yeah, but not at a battle ground...so he looses and I force drain and Janus again getting Mara Jade this time (thatâ€™ll come in handy for the next round) and drop ZIMH and Dreadnaught to meet the Independence and battle that out of there thus cancelling Haven as well. His turn he drops Obi-Waa W/Lightsaber to the 4th marker, and moves Luke over for the battle ground and tells me to go. Thats when I know itâ€™s going to be mine. I drop Mara Jade search for her lightsaber (the only 1 destiny in the deck) and drop 4-LOM to cancel Obiâ€™s Swing - initiate and target Obi, then hit Luke and he draw a 0 for destiny I draw a 6 and that makes him loose and I stack another (ZIMH earlier) then move them in. The game pretty much goes to my advantage the whole time and he canâ€™t set up space that much case ZIMH, Dreadnaught are at Hoth, DIPO and Chimera are sitting @ Kessel and those are the main planets that he has...So I drain him out for a full win w/a + 25
<br />
<br />
FW: 2(+25)
<br />
<br />
Highs: Beating EBO w/o Imperial Decree and Janus Greejatus Tech
<br />
Lows: Forgetting to stack a couple of times and forgetting to make him loose for S&amp;D
<br />
<br />
Game 2 - Lightside RTP vs Bryan Westâ€™s Trooper Assaults
<br />
<br />
This game went really slow in the beginning we both drew and drew to set up our stuff. Getting the characters out and me fetching 8D8 (finally after about 3 turns) and moving him in. I get the Tatooine:DB out, and Ben finds his way there and them moves along with the group to Yavin 4:DB and thatâ€™s where the big battle happens, Darth Vader, Tarkin, 8 Troopers and well placed Trooper Assault/Dark Jedi Presence...well that pretty much wiped out the fleet of people for both of us, I had just flipped the Objective so Vader and Tarkin were out of the game, Han went the way of the Bacta Tank, Luke went to the lost pile along w/Ben Kenobi (which didnâ€™t matter much cause I had another of each in my hand) and on my turn my 8D8 was making his way back w/the DSP for a nice retrieval of 16 I dropped Han out of the fish tank back w/his babe, and Luke made his presence known on Endorâ€™d DB, and Ben was back on Tatooine. It pretty much stayed like that because he didnâ€™t have another Vader or Tarkin to drop out so I sit there and win w/a full +34
<br />
<br />
FW: 4(+59)
<br />
<br />
Highs: Beating a Trooper deck w/mains and then loosing them all but getting them out again next turn.
<br />
Lows: loosing a big battle w/all the mains...but still holding the game.
<br />
<br />
Game 3 - Dark Side (Joel hates this deck) vs Joel Jacksons Hidden Base (that only I have beaten 2 times) 
<br />
<br />
- side note I have only played Joel 3 times. Of those 3 times I was always dark and I have always beat him-
<br />
<br />
Game 3 starts the same for me as always and dropping out all my fun stuff as always. Joel starts searching for planets and getting them out and gets Gold Squadron 1 and General Calrissian to Endor, I get ZIMH and DIPO there to pay him a visit and Lando goes the way of the dodo. His turn he deploys Red Leader In Red 1, Han W/Balster and Luke Skywalker to the Falcon w/Nein Nunb as a passanger, initiates and I loose DIPO he looses some Luke and Red Leader I stack, he moves to Aquaris and sits there. I deploy the Chimera for back up, a Generic Docking bay to Rendili and Jabba the Sloth to that site w/4LOM for more happiness...Joel starts setting up his stuff and I move ZIMH and Chimera and now w/Bossk to Kessel and sit thier cause he like to Kessel Run and I donâ€™t like that so I control Kessel for a majority of the game. He keeps dropping Luke in space and loosing 3 from my side + drains and then we start battling...over and over while I am stacking and winning he decides to finally stop loosing 3 and drops Luke to daddy...where I start loosing 1 but I am moving Vader with the Emperor and head on into the good ole Throne Room to do some dueling... I win the duel he looses three and I win the game... ah well...FW: +15
<br />
<br />
FW: 6(+74)
<br />
<br />
Highs: Beating Joels unbeaten deck for the third time (Iâ€™m still the only one that has)
<br />
Lows: Beating Joels deck again...Joel change your deck man. :)
<br />
<br />
Game 4 RTP vs Diablo Sanchezâ€™s Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi
<br />
<br />
This game was fun, his first turn he drops Vader to the Endor Docking Bay and I set up Crix Madine to the Yavin War Room I say go and he Force Drains w/Vader I Lost In The Wilderness Vader and he goes buh-bye for the remainder of the game hehe... and we each take are pokes from the Visage till I cancel it w/Twass Khaa and Lt. Blount. On his turn he drops Mara Jade to Crix (uh-oh) and her stick ... (uh-oh again) and battles...this hurts...I loose Crix and 12 more card and Mara just sits...smug as she is. Well on my turn I drop Han W/Blaster and Orrimaarko and initiate a battle shooting Mara and hitting her, and making her lost w/+2 more from Orri. He sits in the War Room for the remainder of the game. All through out the game Diablos got the one force drain in space cause he only has one planet and Iâ€™m not contesting ZIMH, DIPO and Chimera so I just loose my three ships and stay to the ground. After about 10 turns of trying to free Leia w/8D8 cause of Sim Aloo moving the good stuff and leaving the ones...damn him...he makes the mistake of moving Sim and Tarkin to Tatooine:DB and then FDâ€™s cause he doesnâ€™t like Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight w/Lightsaber, Ben Kenobi and Han With Blaster @ Yavin... and I play my other Lost In the Wilderness...he moves the top card and I draw a 5 - buh-bye Sim as I finally free Leia and move her to the Yavin happy town. After I finally get everything freed and people out and froce draining for alot I go to play DSP and he just picks up and ends the game. I guess he wanted it closer. :) Ah well another victory for me yeah... FW + 10
<br />
<br />
FW: 8(+84)
<br />
<br />
Highs: winning against Hunt Down
<br />
Lows: Sim Aloo moving my destiny...damn you.
<br />
<br />

Prizes were iffy...actually they were 0 it was a free tournament so no prizes...but Sean is waiting for his Prize packages from D so he will hook us up later...I bought some packs and got a Wedge Antillies, Red Squadron Leader and some other stuff and gave them to a new player...
