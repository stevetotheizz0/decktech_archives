<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Well itâ€™s not that complicated, but here goes</p>

<p>use strike planning to pull han and madine before you activate, before they do anything on THEIR turn.</p>

<p>as soon as you have 6 force(max 2 turns), deploy geezum, madine, and shimi (via slave quarters).  If you have enough force, you can dump threepio at some other location to start tracking magic.</p>

<p>use geezum every turn until all locations are out, Insurrection pulls DB first turn.  plus, there is a pretty decent chance that you will get a site in your starting hand.</p>

<p>BATTLEBATTLEBATTLEdrainBATTLEBATTLEBATTLE (phew) until the opponent has no, I repeat, NO characters anywhere within 376 parsecs of tatooine.</p>

<p>Han and Chewie are pretty much a given to have out, han pulled by SP and chewie by madine.  The camp protects against mara ( a little) and slows down things like ISB mobpoints,etcâ€¦</p>

<p>Sense and alter since I have so many high ability characters</p>

<p>destiny is decently high, but not so high that sense and alter will fail</p>

<p>barriers are useful, even in a beatdown deck</p>

<p>with a gift, artoo + threepio, and shimi, there is a possibility to subtract up to 4 from EACH of their battle destinies on tatooine, which is pretty mush where they stay anyways.  Well, that certainly helps against the battle section of Ralops, doesnâ€™t it?</p>

<p>speaking of ralops, (and ISB, all the like) Underworld contacts helps to preserve my drains</p>

<p>contacts also keeps my tat sites on top of theirs</p>

<p>Losing Track + jar Jar + BM munchen = much pain and suffering and laughter</p>

<p>I just couldnâ€™t resist the marketplace, but maybe I SHOULD take it outâ€¦lol</p>

<p>the padawan man is always a nice card to bounce around</p>

<p>Inconsequential barriers is nice to cancel several annoying cards like NSP</p>

<p>there are many ways to mess with battle destinies</p>

<p>changing the odds</p>

<p>losing track</p>

<p>lando w/ axe</p>

<p>lando w/ gun (sometimes)</p>

<p>wow that is almost 1/4 of my deck heh</p>

<p>anyways, You pretty mush wanna battle the heck out of the opponent and drain if if comes down to that (heaven forbid)</p>

<p>but even draining isnâ€™t that bad, esp with underworld contacts out</p>

<p>main weaknesses (so far as I can see) are</p>

<p>-somewaht slow start, depending on given avtivation)</p>

<p>-podracing</p>

<p>-heavy drain decks w/ beatdown protection (not a WHOLE lotta tese, thoughâ€¦)</p>

<p>well I guess thatâ€™s all, this is the second deck like this Iâ€™ve made, first on tatooine.</p>

<p>thx for your reviews</p>
