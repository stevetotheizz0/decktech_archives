I"n=<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">	Once again time for another local here in Texas. Tournaments have been scarce
<br />
for a long time, now it seems there is one every week. Not that I&amp;#8217;m complaining. This
<br />
report is probably going to be on the long side, so feel free to skip to the games below.
<br />
And no one take offense. This was written with a grain of salt, so don&amp;#8217;t take everything
<br />
seriously. With a new set playtesting is important. Tatooine didn&amp;#8217;t really provide new
<br />
deck types but seemed to help quite a few. Podracing for the lightside blows worse than
<br />
Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge. Must be because Sebulba swallow. After playtesting
<br />
with /Begin gratutuious @#$% kissing/ Texas State Champ and Hunt Down Master
<br />
&amp;#8220;Hoostino&amp;#8221; Warren/ End @#$% kissing/ , he introduced me to a HDADTJ with racing that
<br />
was brutal and a QMC full of paths and tons of other interrupts that was just too good not
<br />
to play. After finishing second to Hoostino at a tourney last week doing my best Van
<br />
impersonation by losing to Justin twice even though I knew what he was playing, I was
<br />
ready to try again without him there. Hoostino tried to help me out even though he wasn&amp;#8217;t
<br />
going to be there by dragging me to Denny&amp;#8217;s the night before. Remembering the labor pains I
<br />
suffered last time and the black bile that oozed out of my pores last time I refuse and
<br />
settle for Reeses PB pie. Much more gooder. Other than the standard horrible service and
<br />
drunken rednecks that inhabit Denny&amp;#8217;s at night, nothing too exciting happened.  I
<br />
followed my standard tipping rule of leaving 50 cents per tooth, so the waitress actually
<br />
owed us money at the end of the night. Off I went to Austin to find an amazing turn-out
<br />
of 30 people. That is huge for a local here. States only drew 40+. I saw lots of old faces
<br />
and a few new. Always a good sign. My decks were QMC with Tatooine and HDADTJ/Podracing by Hootino. Anyway on to the games:
<br />
<br />
Game 1 
<br />
DS Huntdown/Pod Race vs. Reid Delfeld (1594) EBO (Strike planning, Insurrection, ?)
<br />
<br />
Great , just what I wanted to see. A heavy Space deck when I am light on space.
<br />
Oh well, Huntdown is still a machine.  Visage eats away at him as I podrace uncontested
<br />
to his low destinies. Tech Mor and Empy come down and sit in the Holotheatre watching
<br />
VOTE on the big screen. Gotta be better than the XFL. He flips with Beezer, Madine and
<br />
Figgy. I wait till I have 11 cards lost to win the podrace. He deploys Gen Lando in Gold
<br />
Squadron 1 to Kiffex. I can&amp;#8217;t have that , so using a tracked 7 with BIHT, I make Lando
<br />
bend over for one of what would be many times for me today. I lose Bossk, who I retrieve
<br />
with my 11, numbers hits for 6 during the podrace damage, Vader and stick sit at the
<br />
podrace arena and the smell of victory is in the air. Or maybe it&amp;#8217;s just the Colt 45 that
<br />
Lando spilled on his way out. After losing 18 cards in one turn combine with another 8 or
<br />
so to Visage, Reid had little resources left to challenge me with. From There it was just a
<br />
matter of mop-up work. 
<br />
FW 2 +32
<br />
<br />
Highs: This Huntdown is a beast. Few decks play themselves, but even Pauly Shore could
<br />
win with this HDADTJ. Isn&amp;#8217;t he dead anyway?
<br />
<br />
Lows: With racial tension running high, I hated to beat down Uncle Tom, errr Lando but
<br />
it had to happen. The Watts riots were really about the power shortages in LA anyway.
<br />
Sucks to live in So. Cal.
<br />
<br />
Reid is a good player for the limited cards base he has and always makes a game tough,
<br />
especially with his ties. It was good to see him again.
<br />
<br />
Game 2 LS QMC vs. Jacob &amp;#8220;Oscar&amp;#8221; Mayer &amp;#8220;Weiner&amp;#8221; (1950)  Old School Skrillings ETE
<br />
start
<br />
<br />
WTF? Who plays this jizz any more. But this is from the guy who created Bantha for
<br />
Bubo. I have a bad feeling about skrillings, so Insight never leaves. First turn he deploys
<br />
all his sites and draws a few. I throw Epp Obi down, Battle Plan and deploy a site. His
<br />
turn , Baby Jabba, Pote Gailid , Scum  hit the table along with Den Of Thieves. Hmm this
<br />
doesn&amp;#8217;t look good. I really wish I had a Grimtaash about now. I get Capt Up at the system
<br />
with Dash after I flipped and Tunnel for Menace. He drain for about 6 before I get
<br />
Menace fades down and deploys 6 skrillings against Obi who pathed far away. He drops a
<br />
few  lone skrillings  to various Jabba&amp;#8217;s sites over the next few turns. Feeling brave, I send
<br />
Melas, and Epp Luke down to rape one. Uhh barrier Melas, NSP Luke and I can feel my
<br />
daily dose of prison lovin coming as he Abyssians for  another skrilling , uses one off the
<br />
den and drops 2 more. Melas and 10 is never good. Of that 10 , I lost 2 edges and CC
<br />
celebration all in a row from my reserve. Thing went down hill as we pinged each other
<br />
for one or 2 and eventually he used the Ornament for 12 or so and won by 18.
<br />
FL (-18) 2 +14
<br />
Highs: I flipped QMC again. Melas was immune to attrition of 5?&amp;#8217;
<br />
<br />
Lows: Where was Qui-Gon? I just made one mistake and Jake capitalized on it. 
<br />
<br />
Game 3 
<br />
HDADTJ vs. Nick Fehring 1486 Slave quarters, podracing start.
<br />
<br />
This was going to get nasty real fast. Sebulba owns Anakin and gets off to a good start
<br />
with a 5 (8). The holotable with a Monnok also makes an appearance as we both lose to
<br />
Visage. This goes on back and forth till turn 4 when my race destiny sits at 30 to his 24. I
<br />
deploy DVDLOTS against Jedi Luke and EJP Lando at the Outskirts. Duel Luke with
<br />
focused attack. 6,5,7 and it didn&amp;#8217;t matter what he drew. He chooses to turn Luke and lose
<br />
6. Lando the pisses himself as he realizes he never should have quit his job at the psychic
<br />
friends network. He takes a shot of colt 45 and tries to call his mom, but being the crack
<br />
ho she is, the phone sex line is busy. Father and Son show Lando what a good time really
<br />
is. Saber swing. Hack. Destiny 6 to his 3 for total of 18 to 6. Lando and 12. Oh and don&amp;#8217;t
<br />
forget to lose to Watto&amp;#8217;s Box and Visage for a grand total of 30 cards lost in one turn. Not
<br />
pretty at all. Being a glutton for punishment, he put Epp Han and Chewie , protector out
<br />
to oppose the Dark Jedi. Choke Chewie, Hack Han and handshake. 
<br />
FW 2 (+45) 4(+59)
<br />
<br />
High: I have never won by so much with the dark. Everything went perfect. 
<br />
<br />
Lows: It took a whole 10 minutes to play this game and I never like beating somebody by
<br />
so much.
<br />
<br />
Game 4 LS QMC vs. Conner Bragge ROPS (Mob Points, IAO, First Strike)
<br />
<br />
Instead of my usual start of Insight, I started  Don&amp;#8217;t do that again to put the crunch on him
<br />
early. I started to set up on CC with EPP Obi, Dash/outrider at the DB and Captain at the
<br />
system. He set up and flipped with AT-ST and generic pilots. After a few small drains
<br />
here and there, he put Vader and Tarkin at a CC site against Ben who Pathed away. This
<br />
was going to get ugly. I had Clash, Melas, Gift Of The Mentor,  RLR, Path and the
<br />
Doubler/Tripler card. I tunneled for Luke and deployed Melas. 
<br />
Tripler, RLR, Clash Vader, Pathed Obi over as Tarkin soiled his depends. It ended up
<br />
being 20 to 4, double that and it&amp;#8217;s Tarkin and 32 cards. Game and Handshake. FW 2(+28)
<br />
6 (+86)
<br />
<br />
Highs: Being able to Tunnel for what I needed to send Tarkin back to the Blue Oyster for
<br />
Tango night.
<br />
<br />
Lows: Beating a young player by so much.
<br />
<br />
Game 5 LS vs. Ted Woodward 1765  Hunter ISB  (Mob Point, IAO, SSPFT) 
<br />
<br />
Ted is a local who I always have had luck against. He either gets all his ships or no
<br />
planets against me and I win. I was counting on my immunity to Ted to pull through
<br />
again. I started the Mob Points killer, which was worthless. When Hunter said that it
<br />
doesn&amp;#8217;t hurt ISB, he was right. You don&amp;#8217;t argue with the word of the Lord when he has
<br />
spoken. Ted dropped Piett, Mejerrik and 2 or 3 systems first turn. Yep, I was glad I
<br />
started the Mob Killer. That two force I deprived him was crucial. Whatever. I drop Obi
<br />
and give it Ted. I&amp;#8217;m holding Dash and Outrider, Path and ECC Lando, So I&amp;#8217;ll flip next
<br />
turn, but I don&amp;#8217;t want to leave Dash in space. He drops Fondor and the Big E, I drop
<br />
Dash, the DB, Lando, flip, tunnel for Battle Plan and land Dash. The DB was a last
<br />
minute addition for just this reason. He drops a walker and ORS against Dash who paths
<br />
away. He also deployed the Devestator with and shuttled Mejerrik and moved them to
<br />
Endor. My turn I have a power pivot, Intruder missile, tunnel for Leia, Squassion for the
<br />
Falcon and drop on the Devestator. I play the tripler, reduce his power to 0 and win by 10.
<br />
It is ruled that in space Han only doubles because the cards requires him to be present.
<br />
Fair enough. The bad part was after forfeit he lost 5 card. Not as impressive as I would
<br />
have liked.  During this time, Ted asks Brian if I can Path from a Docking bay. He says
<br />
yes, but then Ted points out that CC is only exterior. Path targets interior. What docking
<br />
bay isn&amp;#8217;t both. Sorry Ted. I thought it was legal at the time or I would have walked Dash
<br />
inside with Luke  after I landed the Outrider anyway. We ping each other, he damages the
<br />
Falcon and I send Dash back to space to join him with a little back up. He had shuttled
<br />
the walker up to the Executor in case I had a few more tricks. He still hadn&amp;#8217;t flipped, so
<br />
he shuttled the Walker back the DB. I deployed Ben and Melas, tripler, RLR and this
<br />
seems to be very familiar today as this battle hit him for enough cards that he drew his
<br />
last 8 or before I could retrieve. FW 2(+25) 8(+111)
<br />
<br />
Highs: Winning against a bad matchup for me. 
<br />
<br />
Lows: I felt bad about the misplay, but we all make mistakes. It&amp;#8217;s okay, I&amp;#8217;m not bitter
<br />
about you forgetting about Battle Plan or becoming super anal for the rest of the game.
<br />
Losing sucks. It&amp;#8217;ll give you something to talk about with Chris on Monday. At least I
<br />
learned that if you don&amp;#8217;t declare Dash during the weapon phase, your opponent doesn&amp;#8217;t
<br />
have to let you subtract power. 
<br />
<br />
Jacob was still undefeated at this point, but we played the same side, so I had to rely on
<br />
someone else to try to beat him, while I drew a TD from the Waco area.
<br />
<br />
Game 6
<br />
Michael Richards 1523
<br />
DS HDADTJ vs. Dagobah Mains (Insight, Insurrection and ?)
<br />
<br />
I was disappointed in Richards. Usually he has some crazy teched out tech that rocks.
<br />
Boring Dagobah mains this time. He did have Anakins Podracer to challenge me with. I
<br />
set up with monnok at the Holotable and did some Visage damage. Sebulba got off to his
<br />
usual head start and never looked back. He did cancel visage once, but I redeployed in
<br />
instantly. He played Throw me another charge. No Charge, imagine that. Podracer
<br />
collision let me put OOC/TT #2 out of play. Visage would stay through out the remainder
<br />
of the game. I had Empy, a number and Tech, but he never ditched insight. I did win the
<br />
podrace, used Podracer collision to place an Off the Edge out of play and bury his other
<br />
retrieval means. He placed Qui-Gon at the Cantina who I let drain, while he deployed EJP
<br />
Lando and Ben Kenobi/Stick against my Emp and Vader/Stick.  He just didn&amp;#8217;t know that
<br />
Lando was my @#$% all day long. The focused attack and Circle in my hand were more
<br />
excited than the Bush Twins at an open bar. Circle Ben, Rape Lando for another 10 or so
<br />
cards and that was game after a minor skirmish with a lone Corran that let me put my Leis
<br />
in hand back in my used pile. FW 2(+25)  10(+136)
<br />
<br />
Well Jake held on to win going undefeated with a difference of 156 or some crap like
<br />
that. I picked up a nice Sense foil for my effort all the same. With the new set, I noticed
<br />
that podracing can really disrupt any body&amp;#8217;s strategy, but is more powerful for the dark.
<br />
Also, the Mob point killers didn&amp;#8217;t frighten anybody as I saw 6 ISB decks(A few Space
<br />
Cowboys from Hell among others) and even a Hidden Mains or 2. Darth Maul made an
<br />
appearance in every person&amp;#8217;s deck that owned him, but he wasn&amp;#8217;t always successful in
<br />
dueling. You need to track people. Or load your deck with destinies. Destiny will always
<br />
win you games. Or if your name is Matt Lush and you use Marquand you will auto win as
<br />
well, but I haven&amp;#8217;t seen that lately. Can&amp;#8217;t have a report from Killeen without a little name
<br />
dropping.
<br />
<br />
Props:
<br />
<br />
Jacob &amp;#8220;Oscar&amp;#8221; Mayer &amp;#8221;Weiner&amp;#8221;  for Damn good hot-dogs. Oh yeah and winning too.
<br />
Justin &amp;#8220;Hoostino&amp;#8221; Warren who without his lack of a life these awesome decks never
<br />
would have evolved to be today. 
<br />
Brain Guthrie  for running another great tourney. Hate to see you go. 
<br />
My wife for granting parole for a day.
<br />
Your Mom. She knows why.
<br />
Brian Hunter for being right about the Mob points killer and letting Van lose to him all
<br />
the time. 
<br />
All 30 people who came out. Hopefully we have more turnouts like this
<br />
Halle Berry for earning an extra 500,000 for going topless in Swordfish.
<br />
<br />
Slops:
<br />
<br />
Ted for being Ted
<br />
Me for making 2 mistakes by deploying Melas (your welcome, Jake) and pathing from
<br />
the DB
<br />
The Reeses pie for only being good enough for second. But at least I can still eat solid
<br />
food. After the brownie that can be a struggle.
<br />
Our Denny&amp;#8217;s server for being abducted by a UFO or what ever happens to trailer trash in
<br />
the middle of our meal when she disappeared and never came back.
<br />
Justin&amp;#8217;s Ego which continues to swell. 
<br />
The Army for inventing places like Korea, NTC and Hell.
<br />
Van for not being able to beat Hunter after playtesting all week and teching with Mech
<br />
failure. Your still my hero.
<br />
Swordfish for being another crappy Travolta movie. Hack**Battlefield
<br />
Earth**ughmmpfh.
