-pre tourney info-
<br />
 It was a pretty boring week for my Swccg gaming, I was really just gearing up for the Motor City Comic Con this weekend. I was fairly sure of what I would see, but in Michigan you never can tell. Bored, I called up Jason Ogden to see what he wanted to do. He hadn’t played in a tourney in a couple of months and we decided to meet somewhere to playtest. We met at the wotc store and talked some tech, and the local meta. Court,BHBM,and perhaps HDADTJ/Dueling would be big for dark and light would have the HB variants,training, some form of Profit and TISGIH. 
<br />
<br />
Later-
<br />
 So Jason decides on a HB variant w/heavy sac and Ben/Super Luke beatdown and super falcon for space. I can’t remember if he planned to flip. For dark we both decided on a old favorite: a power characters/sac control,and yab,sniper,barrier hardcore groud domination,for light I used a train to 5 weird retrival for fun/no inserts, call me crazy
<br />
<br />
            -Tourney Info-
<br />
 I planned to test these decks at the weekly tourny at the wotc store. Not too stiff competition but enough to expose the major weaknesses in a deck. As usual I show up late but later than usual so I miss the first round(s h i t !) As I look at the competition I see Ogden  and Jared Strait the second and third in Michigan playing each other first round. This would prove to be really interesting.
<br />
<br />
  Game 1 BYE
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Game 2 My LS vs Jason Ogden(1956)Power ground..?
<br />
<br />
  We start and I remember that his deck beat mine 2/3 of the time with him easily being able to get around Hotjedi so I had to be quick and try to set up training and satisfy S &amp; D damage. I train farily quick but his quick drains and some S &amp; D damage do their thing. Finally Master Luke and Ben Kenobi make an appearance w/sabers and OTE is out so I chase his guys around D-bays and he is fearing the Fallen portal. Also his sac is almost worthless because of my obj. He circles Obi and Master is alone. He deploys Dannick Jerricko and battles I portal tarkin which he cancels the destiny and he swings with vader but misses I cut tarkin and return Dannick to hand his destiny kills luke and vader sticks around, meanwhile my life force is dwindiling so retriving w/test 5 is unlikely. I however have done damage to him with OTE and some saber drains. His S &amp; D are not hurting yet because he had deployed more guys w/ vader to back him up so he deploys a lone Dannick to tat:D-bay to satisfy hotjedi but he is only draining for 2 and I am for 3 at kessel w/ super falcon I will lose this race and he has bigger life force. I am hoping for a miracle and draw my last character: another master luke. next turn I deploy him with all my force but not enough to battle. Next turn he deploys Dr. E and battles (not wanting to lose to OTE)but my remaining force was high so Dr. E goes back and a destiny of 5 smokes dannick and 8 cards,leaving him with 3 left and the drain at kessel finish it
<br />
<br />
  Result: FW by 6
<br />
<br />
  Highs: winning a tight game that was fun
<br />
  Lows : winning a game on a friends mistake,not finishing testing
<br />
<br />
  So now Jason is 0-2 losing to me and jared strait but strangly their are others with better records because I showed up late. So Jason it paired up with a decent player and Jared is paired with another who is undefeated with higher diffrential than me.
<br />
<br />
  Game 3 My DS vs a newbie’s AC start with bo shuda??????
<br />
<br />
  Well this kid lost by ten first round but beat his friend second round by a @#$%load so I guess we get paired up because of my crappy diff. I felt bad I beat on him so bad, but it was pretty uneventful game. I guess his jawas don’t stand up to vader, mara, and tarkin.
<br />
<br />
  Result: FW by 42ish
<br />
<br />
  Highs: winning,I think(seeing someone play jawas)
<br />
  Lows:  playing a hardcore tourney deck against a fun jawa deck
<br />
<br />
  Game 4: My LS vs. Jared Strait’s Endor OPS
<br />
<br />
  Jared won a close game and I looked forward to this matchup.  He plays ops but with a strong ground and no other systems....ok. Our turns go quick and I train sooo slow. Early on vader and tarkin go to the endor D-bay and they shuttle up endor and the accusser flies to Dago. Daughter and yoda complete 1 and he tries to shuttle down but he can’t..he seems confused on dago rules but he plays the same obj. So a wasted turn is Zuckuss deploying  to Endor and moving to dago so they can fly down. Meanwhile I quickly get Master and Ben to tat D-bay with Ben’s saber. In my hand are anakin’s saber for daughter in case vader and tarkin come down. Next turn he moves the accusser back to endor and vader and tarkin go to the bog clearing. On my turn cap han and melas in falcon come down and kill the accusser and it becomes legendary. Luke and ben wrecking crew are draining for 2 and my kessel makes an appearance so I am hitting him for 7 (2 of that from legendary)
<br />
 At this point he gives up.
<br />
<br />
  Result: FW by 24
<br />
<br />
  Highs: Crushing him and making him concede!!!
<br />
  Lows : Having 20 cards in hand
<br />
<br />
  Jason Ogden finished strong and I ended up winning so it was a good tourney with the big surprises being that those guys showed up. 
<br />
