<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Court lets you start with 2 tantooine battlegrounds and pull another, so itâ€™s the perfect set up for occupation.</p>

<p>Start pulling DBs and plop scrubs to start activating tons.  About 2-3rd turn pull Mara and saber to AC.  From there you should be well on your way to dominating Tantooine with the massive activation and frightening amount of characters.  After you get Tantooine out (ideally via Merrejk) fortify it with a pulled executor (via MP) and the bounty hunter ships (via Court).</p>

<p>Do not forget about the court damage if your opponent isnâ€™t on Tantooine, and that the bounty hunters are forfeit +2.</p>

<p>You cannot hide forever lets you pull security precautions, search and destroy, and battle order-pull whatever would help you most (duh).</p>

<p>Godhert handles landing claws.</p>

<p>v. EBO</p>

<p>Start resistance instead of oppressive and wait to deploy Tantooine until you can control it.  With resistance you can ignore EBO and set up Occupation and generally Battle order or search and destroy can be used to hurt the opponent bad. Pull Mara and saber first turn for a steady force drain of 2. when they come to Tantooine just Elis on their as s and they will be off really quick.  You will normally win this match up by about 10 because of all the direct damage and reduced drains (via resistance).  Dengar is key to keeping Tantooine donâ€™t lose him</p>

<p>v. Profit</p>

<p>This deck will beat profit decks most of the time by 15+.  You have a wide variety of Aliens to choose, I generally choose Mara and Evazen then move to Jabbaâ€™s Palace once they start saving force.  Battle order/beatdowns/snipers/elis/dannik/evazen/4-lom should be able to tame most profit decks into submission, set up occupation and you should be able to out damage your opponent.</p>

<p>v. Hidden base</p>

<p>Ignore them, set up occupation, and pull Security precautions and the executor and probe Tantooine so you take no battle damage and if needed pull the bounty hunter ships and probe some more.  Battle Order/Search and Destroy/Dengar should prove to be game winners.</p>

<p>v. TIGIH</p>

<p>Capture Luke and laugh, as there is no way in hell they are taking Tantooine.  If its speeders put Mara in the AC with her saber and  Presence.  Move for free to the Hoth db via the Executor or DSII db and cancel Incom.  Sniper ASPs.  This game should be really easy especially when you consider all the alien power just incase you canâ€™t find Vader donâ€™t deploy any Imps.  Set up occupation and fortify.  This matchup shouldnâ€™t prove to be too hard.</p>

<p>v. MWYHL</p>

<p>Start as you would against EBO.  S+D, Elis, Resistance( reduces AFA), and Occupation should win the game.</p>

<p>I canâ€™t think of any other popular LS decks, but it should beet most.  This deck wins if you play it right, just set up Occupation and you should be well on your to victory. â€˜</p>
