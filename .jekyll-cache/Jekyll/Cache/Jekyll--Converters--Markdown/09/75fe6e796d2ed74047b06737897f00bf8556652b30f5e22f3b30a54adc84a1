<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>The original idea for this deck is Martin Akessons. Before Ref 3 we tested the deck between Fabien Jacques of belgium, him and me.</p>

<p>Coming to Freedomcon i didnt really have a decent dark deck so i thought about building a Ref3 version of this.</p>

<p>Then Martin and i do some playtesting on friday cause he was unsure what to play for dark too.</p>

<p>I play him with my QMC twice and i get one win by a decent amount and lose the second by just a very few cards.</p>

<p>Still i tell him that i think thats the way to go and i go on and build my own version.</p>

<p>This deck starts Tatooine system and then IAO, Mob points and combat response. Allways start these 3 effects.</p>

<p>Against WYS that means you dont have a starting location at all. But thats ok.</p>

<p>If you know your playing against WYS later in a tournament or if your opponent is careless enough to show you his objective before you reveal your starting location, start the bridge.</p>

<p>With the AO adding to your drains and occupation doing its thing you can cause 10 damage a turn on tatooine. Thats way too much for anyone to ignore. So stick to your gameplan and let the opponent come to you.</p>

<p>The ties should allways go to tat, the other 2 ships can be used elsewhere.</p>

<p>Fullfilling dont do that again can be done early and cheap, so be prepared to get mad activation with mob points.</p>

<p>The destiny average in this deck is very high and you got quite a few easy to recycle used interrupts.</p>

<p>This deck never won really high for me but it wins with great consistency, me going 5-0 with it and martin 4-1 only losing to me in the final.</p>

<p>Martins version is only 4 cards different (or rather mine is 4 cards differnt from his)</p>

<p>Instead of Tur Phennir and Saber 2 he played DS-181-3 and Saber 3, which is cheaper, i chose to go with Phennir cause he can grab the AO from deck.</p>

<p>Instead of Keder the Black he played a second Ghhhk &amp; Those rebels wont escape us.</p>

<p>And instead of Masterful Move &amp; Endor Occupation he played Operational as planed.</p>

<p>Thats it</p>

<p>Mad props to Martin for coming up with this in the first place</p>

<p>Also props to Kim for coming up with the title</p>
