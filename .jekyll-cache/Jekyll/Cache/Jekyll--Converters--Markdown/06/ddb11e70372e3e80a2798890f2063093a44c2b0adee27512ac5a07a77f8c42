<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>This is very similar to the last version of this deck.  I added some stuff from the new Enhanced sets, and did a little tweaking, but the concept is the same.</p>

<p>Some people didnâ€™t seem to think that this deck could put up a fight indoors, so Iâ€™ve added a few more carachters.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to pump up the creatures with Yaggle Gakkle to take care of any carachters who wander outside, while using Vader &amp; Co. to hold things down on Cloud City.  The high destiny creatures are great with weapons and Dr. Evazan.	Crush the Rebellion prevents them from drawing mad destiny on CC.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s some specific strategies to use vs. popular deck types</p>

<p>Mains Battle them on CC; Munch them on Tatooine (or anywhere else).</p>

<p>Non-Mains (Ground) munch their puny carachters, and mop up with hit squads.</p>

<p>Hidden Base Search and Destroy + Visage will take thei toll.  Convert Coruscant if you can.  Play Security Precautions  to make them nervous.	You should flip early, alowing your Senses to take care of Transmission Terminated.  If they TT the first Visage, wait until youâ€™re holding a Sense to drop the next.	There is no room for a collection of ships in this deck.</p>

<p>Any suggestions will be appreciated.  Is Battle Order a good idea (to make HB pay for drains)?	How about the Big E?</p>
