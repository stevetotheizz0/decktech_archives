My decks:
<br />
Light side - What Kind Of Deck Is That Anyway? Mixed Up Deck
<br />
Dark side - Tatooine Imperial Arrest Order Deck
<br />
<br />
Game 1
<br />
My LS vs. Jonathan's DS Endor Ops Deck
<br />
I start with Obi's Hut, and use Careful Planning to get the Tosche Station. He starts with Endor Ops stuff, and uses Twi'lek to get Perimeter Patrol. His first turn he plays Ominous Rumors on Endor. The game starts pretty quickly for me. I deploy Obi-wan at his Hut and move to TStation on my first turn. He sets up some sites on Endor. My next turn I drop a spy and a couple of other rebels to the bunker. He responds by beating me out of there with a few imperials. I run away with Orrimaarko and 3 others over to the DForest. I deploy Insurrection, Battle Plan, Bacta Tank, Traffic Control, and Mantellian Savrip. Meanwhile, I set up my drain of one at the DHBoard. He by now has a very impressive platoon of walkers on the planet. I decide not to battle because I don't have my anti-reacting guy on the planet. I just move around and block one drain per turn. I deploy Tantive IV and Wedge Antilles to the Endor system. This is the first time I notice he hasn't played ESBase. Oh well, no big deal. I play Kessel, 2 corvettes and two 2-2 pilots. He puts up 2 Dreads and Ozzel at Endor. I battle. I win by 8. He chooses to lose a dread and 3. I lose Wedge. I move a corvette w/ one pilot to Endor. He then moves to Kessel. And so on for a few turns. On the ground, I deploy the anti-reacting guy and Luke w/ saber. I battle, slash Vader. he slashes Luke. I forget to play Swing-And-A-Miss, which pisses me off. I get a 6 for destiny. He has to lose 8 +2 with Orrimaarko. I lose Luke and some dink 2-2 guy. Then he puts the hurt on me on the ground. He plays a Sniper targeting his AT-ST cannon. Kills almost all of my 2-2 guys, including anti-react guy. I'm left with Orrimaarko and two 2-2 dudes. In space, I get another pilot and force him to choose his system to be battled at. I then play Spiral at that system and beat him by 7. With his ships gone, and my drains at the TStation (2), DHBoard (1), Endor system (1), and Kessel (3) I drain him out. I win by 5.
<br />
<br />
Record: 2 (+5)
<br />
Highlights: Beating a B&amp;B deck for the first time.
<br />
Lowlights: Forgetting to play that Swing-And-A-Miss.
<br />
<br />
Game 2
<br />
My DS vs. Lee's 1:00 a.m. Elom deck
<br />
I wasn't too confident coming into this game. I'd never beaten Lee before. I'd never played this deck before. I'd never play-tested this deck before. Anyway, I start with Mos Eisely and Twi'lek for IAO. He starts with Audience Chamber and Uh-Oh. I get a pretty bad opening hand. I deploy battle order on my first turn just to slow his down if he got tessek. I draw everything up. Bingo! Everything I need to get started. A walker, 3 pilots including anti-reacting guy (I know, I know, Eloms don't react). He puts down 4 Eloms and a Monk at Mos Eisely. I play all of my Walker stuff and a PotF on MosE. I outpower him by a lot, so he moves into the cantina. I deploy U-3PO to the Cantina and Docking Bay 94 (which now separates the Cantina and Mos Eisely). He moves 2 Eloms and the monk to DB94. I move my walker to counter. We do a lot of back and forth between MosE and DB94. He gets his Bo Shuda and Tessek out. I put out Bubo and eat Tessek. I play the Tatooine system, a dread, and VPShuttle. He responds with GL/G1 and a pilot. I now start to think, 'Wouldn't it be great to pound him with VPShuttle's text.' But Vader and Tarkin are on the ground. So have to land the shuttle at DB94, shuttle up Ozzel to the dread so I'd still get a destiny if he battled, and move Vader and Tarkin to DB94. He follows with a battle with my now less powerful Walker. I think he won the battle, but I'm not sure. I shuttle up VPShuttle. He battles again, but I win this one. Then the best thing of the game happens. He doesn't land GL/G1. Yes!! I battle him there, and that pretty much wraps things up. I drain him out. I win by 14.
<br />
<br />
Record: 4 (+19)
<br />
Highlights: Finally beating Lee in a tournament game.
<br />
Lowlights: Uh... I guess that I didn't get to set up my Tatooine Occupation.
<br />
<br />
Game 3
<br />
My DS vs. Tommy Minton's Hidden Base/Numbers Deck
<br />
Let me say for the record that the night before the tournament I took out my #s protection (except Resistance) to put in more walkers. That helped me win game 2. This time it would be my undoing. I was being killed from the get-go. He uses The Signal at the start to get out Anger, Fear, Aggression, and get this - it comes up in my opening draw! So that's an automatic loss of 4 force. I put down Blizzard Scout 1 w/ DS-61-2 aboard. I save my force to play a Dread w/ 3 pilots and Bus. I am able to win a few battles, but the constant loss of force from NTMtOdds is painful. This game was actually closer than is seemed for a long time. He does end up flipping. I probe at Tatooine, Y4, and some other planet. I am wrong all three times. I could have probed at the other 2 systems had he had any ships there. Then I could have justified moving my ships there to block a force drain. But instead I chose to stay at Y4. I put a whole bunch  of forfeit fodder on board the Dread and Bus so I'd get 2 destiny for the rest of the game. He puts back all but one with Traffic Control. My turn. I have 4 force left. I can a) make another attempt to win the game, only to lose eventually, or b) draw up, causing the differential to be one less than it would have been. I choose b - draw up. I lose by 21.
<br />
<br />
Record: 4 (-2)
<br />
Highlights: Holding my own vs. a Hidden Base deck in space.
<br />
Lowlights: Knowing I took out my #s protection AND my Search and Destroys the night before to make room for more walkers.
<br />
<br />
Game 4
<br />
My LS vs. some dude's Hoth/Endor/Space/Non-IAO 2-2 Imperial/Imperial Decree Deck
<br />
This guy gives a new meaning to phrase 'putting your game face on.' I start to play this guy, who had seemed to me like he was a really nice guy before I started to play him, and he just turns cold as stone. He no longer cares about me, himself, his family, national security. You name it. If it's not game-related, it's not important. Anyway, he starts with 5th Marker and uses Combat Readiness to get out the 3rd Marker. This is just screaming Imperial Decree. And it is. By turn 3 he has it set up, and rather nicely I might add. He had an Tempest Scout 4 w/ DS-61-3 at the 5th marker and Vader w/ Saber, Tempest Scout 3 (I think) w/ DS-61-2 at the 3rd marker. O....k. I'm not going down there. I don't get Obi-wan in my starting hand for the first time in the 10 games I've used this deck, so that was a shocker, but not game-breaking. I deploy him turn 3 or 4 to his hut and deploy Orrimaarko to TStation for some extra security. I move Obi to the TStation. I end up drawing up forever trying to find a system and the HGBoard. I finally get the HGBoard and deploy it with PoaSkywalker. I put another PoaSkywalker on 3rd Marker to cut his drains in half. He deploys Endor Forest Clearing with no one at it. Hmm. Well, I wait a few turns and he still puts no one down. Finally, I put down 3-4 rebels. Stomp! He slaps down Tempest 1 w/ Igar. I lose everything from the site and he loses Igar. I finally pull up Kessel and deploy it with Tantive IV and Wedge to guard it (yes, the same duo as in game 1). He slaps down a dread w/ some pilot dude and bus (also sounds familiar) and battles. I send Wedge to the Tank. He loses the pilot dude. My next turn I put out Wedge, another 2-2 pilot, Luke w/ saber, and Wes Janson (for forfeit fodder), and 2 corvettes. I battle. He draws a 5 and a 3 which he'll end up tracking for the rest of the game. I draw a 5. He loses the dread. I send Wedge to the Tank (since Wes's forfeit was only 7). Next turn he lays it on my space fleet. First of all, he deploys Kashyyyk, providing a means of escape for even the slowest Imperial capitals. Then he plays Lateral Damage on the corvette w/ Luke on it. He deploys a DSSD, a new pilot and a vehicle for fodder. I battles. He draws that 3 and 5 again. I think 'Well, why not just lose Luke and the corvette w/ LD so I won't have to go to Kashyyyk.' I lose Luke and the corvette and say I've lost everything. He 'reminds' me that the corvette is forfeit = 0. I say okay, and take back Luke and the corvette. He then says, 'Nooooooo, you lost the Luke already. Put it back!!' Well, rather than to start an incident, I just said okay and lost Wes too. I then move the LDed corvette to Kashyyyk and draw destiny - 2. Damn. I made a gabble that he didn't have any more ships he could deploy to kill me poor little corvette, and he didn't. He moved to Kashyyyk. I now have a drain of 2 at Kessel. I move to Kashyyyk. Draw destiny for LD - 4. It's good! He then moves to Kessel. I now have a drain of 2 at Kashyyyk. It goes on like this for a while, and eventually I come out on top, but only by 2.
<br />
<br />
Record: 6 (0)
<br />
Highlights: Winning my 10th game with my light deck, and doing it without any force drain modifiers. 
<br />
Lowlights: Still not finishing a tournament with a positive differential.
<br />
<br />
Now here's the real highlight - the prize support. I get 1 pack of Premiere Unlimited, 1pack of Jabba's Palace, and 2 packs of Endor. I got Y4: Massassi Throne Room, Kiffex, Tempest Scout 1, and Tempest Scout 2.
<br />
<br />
Then we have to answer a trivia question about the Star Wars trilogy. If we get it right, we get a single (all of which are mains) for free. My question is: 'In The Return of the Jedi, according to Lando, where is the strongest power source for the Death Star II?' Uh... isn't it the main power generator? Correct! And your prize is... a Daughter of Skywalker FOIL. This is a card I actually want for the text as well as the FOIL.
<br />
<br />
All in all, I had a good tournament. I can see that my light deck is starting to falter, but it's nothing that a little tweaking won't cure. My dark deck needs work, although I am happy that I finally managed to beat Lee in a tournament game (after the smack down from hunt down, the rage of cc celebration w/ Eloms, and the 1- and 2-force losses a few months before). I still need to get a security precautions, so I'll trade for that before the next tournament. And I'll be putting at least one search and destroy in my next dark side deck. That's all I can tell you for now, but you can see them in 2 weeks at the next tourney. I think my cousin will be with me. He's been waiting to use his Rescue the Princess (no kidding, this thing works really well) and his Walkers on Tatooine deck (not bad either, but does need some improvement). Until then...
