I"<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The whole trip started when steve gillispie and i were talking about how we were going to get to Wizard World. We finally found someone from our area that was going. So we met him at his work that is about 5 min. from my house. We arrived to his card shop around 4:30. When we got there he told us there was another person going along with us. So we left around 5 o'clock. We stopped in Merrilville to eat dinner. We ate at Lone Star. After eating we got back on the road and arrived at the Holiday in, in Chicago at around 9. We went into the hotel lobby to get our room. We waited in line for what seemed like an hour. We finally reached the counter and the lady said it was going to be $200 for one night. It was so expensive b/c it was across the street from the Rosemont Convention Center. So we parked the car and went to our room. In our room it was me, Steve Gillispie, Chris Fraker and Jim Bousum. When we got to our room it was around 10. So we started playtesting our decks against all sorts of different deck types. We tested for about 2 hours changed our decks and went to sleep. We woke up the next morning at 8 am. We all got up took our turns taking a shower got dressed and went to eat breakfast at the hotels buffet. When we got down there it was $11.95 a person so i passed and didnt eat then. After they ate we went to check out of the hotel. Then we headed to the convention center. We walked around the convention center for about an hour. We stopped by the Decipher boot and got some deck lists for the tournament. We went to a table and sat down and filled out the deck lists. By this time it was 11:30 and the tournament started at noon. So we headed to the ballroom. We got there filled out our command cards handed in our deck lists then sat around and talked until the tournament began. It was about 12:15 and we were about to begin when Jared Lockwood shows up saying he got stuck in traffic. So we had to wait another 20 minutes for him to fill out his deck lists. So Eric Olson, who was running the tournamnet, finally hit pair around 12:40. Now for what i was playing. For lightside i played Profit with eloms and on the edges for retrieval. For dark i played a SYCFA start for early activation and played with lots of characters and elis helrots and you are beatens. I will post my decks at a later time. Now for the games.

So i shuffled deployed ben and han w/gun battled hit jquille and drew two 4's he lost a card off the tope with emperors power to add a destiny and he drew a 3. He lost J'quille and 16 cards. The next turn he deployed Darth Vader to where han, luke and ben were captured luke with his objective battled lost one off the top to add a destiny and drew a 4 and a 4 used vaders text to add one to each destiny draw so i had to lose ben and han. that was my last han. luckily for me he had first strike out. He had mara and iao pilot in the audience chamber i deployed 4 eloms and tawss khaa battled i retrieved one(which was han) and he lost one and i drew a 3 for destiny he lost one off the top to add a destiny he drew a 3 and a 4. that was the turning point i got han back killed off his people on tat. got han back to tat. and won by 3.

<br />
Game 6 vs. John's ISB drop and drain
<br />
He played lots of sites lots of isb agents i put people down battled he drained i busted out han retrieved my 10 and on the edged to help with all the force i was losing. When my objective was flipped it was just too much force loss for him.
<br />
FW 12(+111)
<br />
<br />
So it was me and Jared Lockwood in the final confrontation. Juz flipped the coin i won and played dark first. Jared played an ebo deck similar to the one clint posted on decktech, this was the worst matchup for my deck, he drained for a lot in space had undercover spys at my sites, he controlled the game the whole time. Next game he activated way to much force way to early myoom proved to be the killer and so i lost this game too. Congratulations to Jared for winning. All and all it was a fun tournament, and i'm out.
