<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>Ok startegie is simple. Get Wuta on table quick</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deploy from hand</li>
  <li>Get him with Chewie (can get chewie with Madine)</li>
  <li>Get him with Madine (can get Madine with Balanced Attack)</li>
</ul>

<p>The get your locations with Wuta. Deploy ewoks + an Ithorian to each site.
You drain a lot and are power a lot.</p>

<p>Don’t forget the GT’s of the ewoks and ewok weapons.</p>

<p>The powerful furballs strike</p>

<p>This is a basic layout of an Ewok deck. Adapt it or change it. All comments are welcome.
