Secret Plans</p>

<p>I dont think any card explanations are really necessary; everything is pretty self-explanatory. So here goes the strategy</p>

<ul>
  <li>Early Game -</li>
</ul>

<p>Pull Carida before you activate. First turn search for a battle ground docking bay if you have enough force to get Vader out, otherwise, pull the Executor Docking Bay. Second turn you will most likely have Vader, and you deploy him to one of your docking bays.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mid Game -</li>
</ul>

<p>When your opponent deploys, crush him. This deck has tons of beat down capability, and should be able to handle anything that comes your way.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Late Game -</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no late game with this deck. Your going to pound your opponent rather quickly.</p>

<p>Now for specific strategy</p>

<p>VS. HB Mains</p>

<p>This game is fairly simple. When he deploys, you stomp him. Well tracked destiny helps in this matchup; though I think its nearly impossible for the light side to handle a focused beatdown deck such as this. Remember that You Cannot Hide Forever reduces luke and obis defense value by 1.</p>

<p>VS. Profit</p>

<p>Start Mara and Dr. Evazan. Take over the AC and prevent the flip. Develop a presence at Carida and drain at your docking bays with walkers. Your opponent cant win if he cant drain you.</p>

<p>VS. Agents In The Court - Aliens</p>

<p>Please; if they are not getting Captured, Choked, Blasted, or Shocked, then they are going down to your High Destiny. Play smart and win.</p>

<p>VS. Agents In The Court - Mains</p>

<p>Play the same way as HB Mains.</p>

<p>VS. Watch Your Step</p>

<p>Take control of kessel and you win. No combination of Smugglers are strong enough to hold up against this deck.</p>

<p>VS. MWYHL Testing</p>

<p>Start Secret Plans. Set up drains, get S+D going. You will kill him in most cases before he completes his training, or will have crippled him enough to where it doesnt matter.</p>

<p>VS. Falcon Deck</p>

<p>If your opponent is dumb enough to leave Leia on the falcon, so be it. He wont be able to drain or battle. If he doesnt, then just pound the damn thing. Easy win.</p>

<p>I usually give a more detailed strategy section, but this deck isnt very hard to play. I would almost go so far as to say it plays itself.</p>
