<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>the number of interrupts should be 20, not 23 and the character number is 14, not 13.  Swap It’s a Trap for Mantellian Savrip, i’m 1 card short, that card should be SomeOne Who Loves You</p>

<p>This deck has been very effective.  It’s still in playtesting, but just by the looks of it, YOU KNOW IT’S GOOD.</p>

<p>Why only 2 Massa Lukes and 2 Jedi Lukes?	why not 3-4 MASSAs and 0-1 Jedi Lukes?’</p>
