<p>Iâ€™M REALLY SORRY BUT I MESSD UP BAD ON THIS.  ITâ€™S TITLE IS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH A V.2.0 AFTER IT.  AND THE DISCRIPTION IS SUPPOSED TO READSEVERAL ENHANCEMENTS TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION.  SORRY ABOUT THIS
Alrighty On your first turn, the ideal thing to do is search for Lando and get him and possibly another alien to the Port Town District and move one of them to the security. Use the Objectives Game Text and pull either Bespin or Cloud City. Try to get the obsidian and if necessary, the Bounty Hunters in their Ships to Cloud City and put your Star Destroyers at Bespin. Make sure that you donâ€™t flip the objective until you get CC Occupation out otherwise you canâ€™t pull it.
Keep picking up 3-5 force until you get the necessary cards to flip your objective.</p>

<p>Okay now that the first part is done, get as many sites out as you can. The good thing is that you donâ€™t really need to reinforce your people at sites since you get at least power plus 5 and their deploy is plus 1. Have maybe a total charachter power without the bonuses at one site of 7-10.</p>

<p>Now that that is done you are basically set and are making them lose nearly 20 per turn and the only thing that they can use to stop you is either an all out assault on Bespin or Ultimatum.
Or if they come with an under cover spy you can capture it with Hutt Smooch.</p>

<p>Now you need to get those small things in that give you the extraâ€¦umph. Drop Presence of the Force at the Security Tower so that it counts as a battleground and put the other one wherever you see fit. â€˜Expandâ€™ the game text of the Port Town District so you get the power bonus, deploy reducement and drain bonus. Put Mosepp down so that he is at and in between two sites where they are taking the most force loss. Get Salacious Crumb down to pick off that main that they draw for destiny and you are basically done. Just also make sure to get Vader and Maraâ€™s saber down so you get the bonus from that.</p>

<p>Once you get Cloud City Controlled you may go after the opponent in space with your excess ships.</p>

<p>Versus Other Decks</p>

<p>HB For this reason, I was thinking of adding Security Precautions so you may do that. You have enough space power to probe their system but even if you donâ€™t you wonâ€™t be losing as much force as they will be. Also they canâ€™t cancel your drains so youâ€™ll be okay.</p>

<p>MWYHL/Beatdown If they come after you, youâ€™ll have enough power to stop any major beatdown. Maybe, if you feel like it, go to Dagobah and give â€˜em a piece of your mind, stop the training.</p>

<p>Profit For this, also start Secret Plans and either stop them from releasing Han or donâ€™t. Either way you should be okay. If you donâ€™t, youâ€™ll be able to flip your objective quicker and achieve victory faster. Also I doubt that they will have 10 force when they flip their objective right away (since you wonâ€™t go there).</p>

<p>DBO For this, simply donâ€™t let them flip their objective or let them flip it and then flip it back.</p>

<p>Things to change
You might wanna go with CC Troopers.  If so add Trooper Assualts and Den of Theives along with Abyssin Ornaments.  Maybe put in another system and use Imperial Decree to help you out.</p>

<p>Anyway you use it good luck and â€˜May The FOrce Be With Youâ€™	â€˜</p>
