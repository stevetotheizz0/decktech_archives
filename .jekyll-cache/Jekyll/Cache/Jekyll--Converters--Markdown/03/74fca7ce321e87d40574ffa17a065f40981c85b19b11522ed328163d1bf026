<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Basics You wait until your opponet deploys on the ground or in space then you lay a huge beatdown and take over his sites and drain. You have good forfiet so donâ€™t woory to mauch about being attacked. Just drain and battle the game away.</p>

<p>This is a fun deck, but it can also win like a champ if you want.</p>
