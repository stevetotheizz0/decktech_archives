<p>Strategy: ‚Äò</p>

<p>Now for the Strategy‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The Main goal of this deck is to battle and force drain. Since their our only 5 battleground sites and their are 21 characters a good Star Wars player can easily defend most of the sites. Force Draining is not needed as much as battling.</p>

<p>You hopefully have read the cards and have probably said that I dont have enough smugglers or Lukes in this deck for this objective. Well thats what I said, but this deck still works.</p>

<p>What I love to do with this deck is surprise the opponent. I wait for a few turns and gather lots of force then I deploy 4 or so characters at one site, start a battle, and then wipe him out. This leaves your opponent speechless. I call this the Element of Surprise.</p>

<p>HOW TO START THE GAME</p>

<p>Start with the objective which lets you deploy Tattoine system, Docking Bay 94, and Cantina and the opponent may not generate any force at Cantina. Now each turn you will always generate atleast 6 force. Enough for you to deploy one character each turn. And the oppinent would be generating 4 force plus whatever he decides to deploy. Hopefully you‚Äôll draw a good starting hand. Don‚Äôt deploy 1 character a turn. Build up your foce and deploy 3 or 4 characters together. That way you can defend each site without getting wiped out. Now its your 5th turn or so. You have characters on the table. Do this same thing a few times so you can get a few charactetrs that are well-defending each site. Now by the time your set up you can battle and force drain.</p>

<p>Yes the starships in this deck are very weak. I recommend keeping most of the starships at one site that way you have a decent number of ships defending the site. The deck is not meant for space so pelase dont criticize me on how i dont have great starships. You may easily replace these starships for bigger and better ships.</p>

<p>THERE IS NO REASON TO EXPLAIN EACH AND EVERY CARD JUST READ THEIR GAME TEXT AND YOU WILL KNOW WHY I PUT THEM IN.</p>

<p>AND Finally‚Ä¶</p>

<p>DO NOT RATE THIS DECK IF YOU DID NOT READ THE WHOLE THING. i really dont like people that do it. Any comments on cards would be appreciated and would be considered.  But please don‚Äôt tell me how bad my starships are because i already know. Now if you read the whole thing then GO RATE</p>
