I"<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Greetings. Chris Gregg held a normal three-rounder at Junior's Comics in Austin on Saturday, drawing a decent turnout of about 15 or so players. I went down with Matt Lush and Sam "slambeano" Pavlak. This is our last tournament together, as the feared Team Killeen will dissolve before months end. So I guess we had something to prove, although I nor Matt felt like proving @#$% after getting a lackluster amount of sleep the previous night. But we ventured out anyhoo. I took a variant of my Soul Reaver deck for the light (basically a hardcore Revolver that is undefeated in the hands of three different players), and a HD with lots of Vaders, walkers, high destinies and docking bays (I might post it later). 
<br />
<br />
Game 1 VS Eric Cleggs standard Rops
<br />
I never though I could beat a good Rops so badly. He started IAO, at which point I pretty much thought was game being I play with seven Revos. First turn I Revo Ralltiiir and start looking for the Falcon to stop his flip for a long time. I dont find one, but I set up Obi and Saber at a Revoed Forest after nailing Mara for some damage. He never got flipped until the very end, and by then it was far too late. After his flip he left Ozzel alone at the Swamp and saved some Force to react with. This cost him, as I Revoed the Swamp, now he couldnt react to the battle, and I dropped some EPPs and hit him for around 10 or eleven cards.

Highs: Whipping the supposed best deck out there. Using some tech at the Swamp. 
<br />
Lows: None really.

Game 2 VS Wade Kothmans HBX with anti-drain out the wazoo
<br />
Wade is a familiar opponent, and I usually beat him, but he is never an easy win. He starts Do, Or Do Not, as I guess I am a well-known SAC player. Well, it surprised the hell out of him when he realized I wasnt playing any SAC at all. Anyways, one card won this game for me - Search And Destroy. He cancelled two Visages real quick, and stopped my drains with TK-422 and Boussh along with the occaisional Rebel Fleet. But he had nothing for S+D, and I eventually Trampled all his spies and probed his base while avoiding the X-Wing beatdown.

Highs: Getting some use out of S+D. I have used it before, but never did it come close to winning a game for me. 
<br />
Lows: So many drain counters.
<br />
<br />
Game 3 VS Josh Mitchells Profit/X-Wing Swarm (?)
<br />
He starts S-Foils, immediately confusing me. What the hell is this supposed to be? I start Mara as she is the only alien in my deck and I think I can back her up quickly. First turn, I deploy Vader and a Saber at JP and flip. Drain of three and Visage consumed him. He set up Artoo and A Gift, but I Trampled. He finally goes into space with RL in R1 at Coruscant after just taking the hit for about five turns. I respond with ECC Iggy on the Bus and draw a few tracked sixes to wipe him out and get some damage in. Late he deploys EPP Leia and plays Someone Who Loves You to free Han. He leaves the two there against Vader with a Saber, Mara + Saber, Tarkin, and some 2/2 chump. I have You Are Beaten in hand, so I know its game (well it had been game for a while). I battle, drew some tracked sixes and he lost out.

Highs: The whole game went my way.
<br />
Lows: I forgot to use Reactor Terminal during that last turn, otherwise I would have won by over 40. Oh, well. 
<br />
<br />
Game 4 VS Joe Amayas Ice Plains/3rd Marker M&amp;T
<br />
He cant start Crush, so Im happy. Much to my chagrin, I get no Revoes nor Signals in my starting hand, but I do get Ben Kenobi, Saber, and the Jundland Wastes. He drops Mara at the 3rd Marker on his first turn, I deploy Ben and Saber at the Wastes the next turn and draw for a Nabrun. Finally, my Revoes get cooking, and he starts to choke. He comes after Ben, who is now accompanied by EPP Leia with Vader and Saber, but cant do anything as he misses the swing and I play Smoke Screen. I just kept the drain of three going and nailed him with mains everywhere he went.

Highs: Battles all went my way.
<br />
Lows: Revo took an usually long time to set up. 
<br />
<br />
Game 5 VS Wade Kothmans standard Hunt Down SAC M&amp;T
<br />
Wade is the first to start Crush on me all day, probably because he had just beaten Matts Revo deck and was scouting earlier. Anyways, I get a crappy hand and he deploys the Cantina and saves up. I cant get anything going, as I cant find a damn grabber. He deploys Vader and Tarkin to the Cantina on his next turn. That and Visage start to hurt me. I cannot activate enough to really fight him, so I just bide my time, taking the hit. He puts out more stuff, so I am forced to go down and fight with limited activation. The Revo engine got set up, but it was a little too late, as he kept fighting me off him, even with Savrip out all game. I could not keep up.

Highs: I made him lose to Visage when his card was flipped a few times (what a moron :)
<br />
Lows: Crappy draws.

Game 6 VS Matt Lushs YAAJ Revo
<br />
We tested this matchup numerous times, and he figured out how to beat after I reamed him the first time we tried it. I knew this was gonna be rough. I gets his stuff going without any problems as usual, and I get Vader and Saber to Yavin (via DB transit). He deploys Master Luke and battles. He plays Smoke Screen, but I remind him I get a chance to choke first, and I get lucky and draw a blind six to end the battle. But next turn, he deploys Obi-Wan and Smokes him this time. Now I have to draw for Vader, as my activation aint too superb. I get one, and get him and Mara down. He sets up a huge crew (Ben, M. Luke, and Orrimaarko) at a Tatooine site and Nabruns over to Vader and some 2/2 chump at the Farm, where I am draining for three. I should have won the game here, but I mistracked a damn six. Since that was the move phase (IAO), he draws. I play You Are Beaten on Ben and Evader to activate more to reach what I think is a six. I battle and attempt to choke Luke. NOOOOO!!!! Its Come Here You Big Coward!. The next destiny is the six, I just screwed up and it cost me the freakin game. Plus, I forget to swing! Dammnit! What the hell is wrong? I was just so pissed that I screwed that up that I forgot. So he only loses one dude, and I run Vader away, as Ben Kenobi just blows. Had I not mistracked and swung, I would have hit him for seven or eight cards, as I had another six tracked that would have been my destiny on a hit Orrimaarko. Oh well. I suck. He starts spreading out, as both our piles are becoming thin. He forgets Order To Engage towards the end, which would have won it for him, but he still gets a higher drain, and pulls it out by a single card.

Highs: The game was awesome, one of the best Ive played in a while. 
<br />
Lows: Mistracking bullcrap. 
<br />
<br />
I was near-livid following that last game, but since it was against Matt, I didnt really get upset. Practice makes perfect, so I guess thats what Ill do. Matt winds up in first and I get third. Overall a fun tourney some good games played. Now, its on to the DSII pre-release and the Regional, which Im gonna take, dammnit.

Darwin bless. Hoostino out.
