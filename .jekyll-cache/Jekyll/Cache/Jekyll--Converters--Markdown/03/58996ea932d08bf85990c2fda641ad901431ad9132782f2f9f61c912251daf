<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>Hmm. Where to start. Since this is more of a template deck right now I’ll talk a bit differently then normal.</p>

<p>Start  Either start Wise Advice if you expect to see SAC or Battle Plan otherwise.</p>

<p>Locations - since these can be pulled from reserve I saw no reason to put in more then I activate then 12 from my locs after turn 4-5. Since the gas miners and clouds crank the drain potential up a bunch I didn’t wanna spread out where the flip back would be accomplished too easily. Drain potential is 10 at max and if Celebration is up it’ll be enough.</p>

<p>Characters  Yoxgit to make sure you don’t have to fight for the system if they bring Executor or something. Eloms are nice 4 destinies and since Crush the Rebellion will stop extra destinies the extra power they give is just as nasty. H’nemthes because I don’t want no 2/2 Scrubs. Bothans for Visage. Miners for drains. EPP Lando for extra fire power. Harc Seff to cut off drains. EPP Han and Luke are for extra fire power to go to their locations or if they are playing a non-dueling deck ( don’t wanna deploy versus a dueling deck for lack of duel adders ).</p>

<p>Blue  The Z-95s will keep the flip going back and forth , if you’ve abandoned the thought of Celebrating. Tantive 4 and leaders are a decent space force especially with EPP Luke and Han on them. The Cloud Cars will help protect BCC and the one other cloud sector.</p>

<p>Effects  Celebration for force retreival. Order to Engage to do damage. SAC protection in Wise Advice and Grapplers.</p>

<p>Interrupts  Anti-Numbers and Elis in multiple. Nabrun x2 and extra Signal. 2 Chimes for whatever non-unique alien needed.</p>

<p>That’s it. Just my little first sketch here. It is very possible to include a Sabaac version or Mains version or other things but I like the way this one turned out.</p>
