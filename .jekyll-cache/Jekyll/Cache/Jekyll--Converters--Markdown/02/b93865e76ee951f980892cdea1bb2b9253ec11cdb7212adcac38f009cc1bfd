<p>That ThingÂ’s Operational  â€˜</p>

<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Still confused? Thatâ€™s all right. Iâ€™ll show you how powerful this deck can be.</p>

<p>1st Turn Activate your whopping 5 force, toss down IAO and the DS2. Grab the DS2 DB, throw down Jerjerrod there, deploy the Capacitors.</p>

<p>2nd Turn Activate your 9. Deploy the Tatooine DB and the Coolant Shaft. Put somebody at the docking bay.</p>

<p>3rd Turn Activate 11. Deploy the Reactor Core and the Spaceport DB on Tatooine. Toss That Thingâ€™s Operational on the core. Put somebody at the Spaceport DB. Move the DS2 to Tatooine. Transit Jerjerrod to one of the DBs.</p>

<p>While this is happening, you should be doing a couple things.</p>

<p>1) First, you should be looking for either Tatooine or Merrejk. They are EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.</p>

<p>2) Second, look around for some Twiâ€™leks to get We Shall Double Our Efforts. This is less important, but it still helps. Also, try to get His Name Is Anakin out.</p>

<p>3) You should put some guys at the DS2 system to protect it from early LS attack.</p>

<p>After that, youâ€™ll want to spread out on Tatooine (but not so much that you are weak at one site) and drain. The DS2 will be above Tatooine and direct damaging for ATLEAST 4 a turn, 5 if We Shall Double Our Efforts is out, up to 8 if the other 3 sites are out. Get Palpatine with Overseeing it Personally on him to Tatooine. Drain on the ground for tons (8 without any modifiers and all sites out, 11 with sabers, 13 with sabers and Presences, 18 with sabers, Presences, and Overseeing it Personally). Drain a little in space. Youâ€™ll eventually completely destroy them (on average, youâ€™re hurting them for 15 force a turn) and not only win, but win by a huge differencial.</p>

<p>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOTE I realize that it is possible for the light side to blow up the Death Star II. But it really doesnâ€™t matter. At the very least, youâ€™re direct damaging with it for 4 a turn. It takes them 4 turns to get to the core. If they blow it up, I lose 12 force or something. So Iâ€™ll have lost 12 force, theyâ€™ll have lost 16. So they canâ€™t possibly make me lose more force than I make them lose. Either way, Iâ€™ll still be draining on the ground for massive amounts after that.</p>

<p>Some explanations of the cardsâ€¦</p>

<p>Darth Maul + Lightsaber Power 7, deploys for 6 on Tatooine, and can drain unhindered by little scrubs in his way.</p>

<p>The Emperorâ€™s Sword &amp; Shield Deploy for 3 to the DS2, and are power 6 if you keep the Emperor on the DS2.</p>

<p>Aurra Sing Power 4, ability 4, and can steal sabers.</p>

<p>Sebulba Power 4, ability 2, but lowers the opponentâ€™s power by 3, effectively making him power 7.</p>

<p>We Shall Double Our Efforts Adds 1 to X on That Thingâ€™s Operational, and makes it much harder for them to blow up the DS2.</p>

<p>His Name Is Anakin Limits their force generation with Staging Areas, and makes their aliens deploy for a lot more on Tatooine.</p>

<p>Please review constructively.</p>
