I"ø<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After one month of being here at college (University Of California, Santa Cruz), I had been itching to play some Star Wars.  I had slated to run a tournament on Saturday the 21st, in the evening, and another local TD scheduled one that same morning.  This weekend became another Los Gatos/San Jose Super Saturday.  On Thursday night, I get a ride from UCSC back to my home in Los Gatos.  I spend Friday examining my decks, and doing some very light tweaking.  On Saturday morning, I and my little brother drive over to Collectorâ€™s Corner II in Los Gatos and get ready for the tournament.
<br />
<br />
My decks:
<br />
LS - Crusade Of Salvation v1.01 - TIGIH with mains and ASPed 7s (Ewok Catapults) to win battles, retrieve big with On The Edge, and to turn Vader
<br />
DS - The Emperorâ€™s TIE Interceptor Hell - BHBM using Emperorâ€™s Power to draw destiny w/ my TIE Ints.
<br />
Both of these decks are posted here on DeckTech, if you wish to examine them further.
<br />
<br />
Once at the store, I meet up with some friends, and join a conversation with Paul Feldman and Kevin Shannon on their Worlds Day 3 experiences.  15 minutes later, the TD showed up, and 5 minutes after that, the tournament got underway.
<br />
<br />
Game 1 - LS vs. Cat Cederâ€™s BHBM
<br />
I donâ€™t really like playing against BHBM decks; the games are for the most part boring.  If I remember correctly, he got a slow start w/ Palpy in hand.  A few turns in, he starts deploying stuff.  I recall Flagship Executor w/ Admiral Piett @ Rendili getting taken out by Captain Han in the Falcon.  I have my 7 engine working, so I come down for some battling.  Unfortunately, I wasnâ€™t able to retreive much thanks to my On The Edges getting Sensed.  Anyways, 3 won battles later, I turn Vader.
<br />
<br />
Result: FW by 16; 2(+16)
<br />
Good Things: I turned Vader for the win
<br />
Bummers: limited retreival due to Sense
<br />
Compliment of opponent: He had a great deck, and played very well, but I was somehow able to pull off the win.  It was a great game.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2 - DS vs. Joey Friedaâ€™s TIGIH (poor copy of mine)
<br />
Joeyâ€™s a little kid with some potential.  His LS deck has the same mechanics as mine (the 7 engine), and goes for the turn.  I got my systems out fast, got my TIEs down, and drained away.  He came to space, but got beaten out of it thx to All Power To Weapons and Lateral Damage.  Vader picked up Luke, and brought him in for some dueling, which I dominated in.  In the end, I won the drain race.
<br />
<br />
Result: FW by 30; 4(+46)
<br />
Good Things: My systems came quick.
<br />
Bummers: Vader didnâ€™t come down until mid/lategame.
<br />
Compliment of opponent: Good try, but he wasnâ€™t able to cause me enough damage.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3 - DS vs. Paul Feldmanâ€™s â€™experimentalâ€™ EBO
<br />
I was looking forward to this game.  Last time we played, it was at this same place, and I was using the same deck.  He started 3 effects, and Signaled for A New Secret Base.  First turn, he pulls Madine w/ Strike Planning, and with Madine, pulls Ketwol and deploys him.  Ketwolâ€™s the key here: Feldmanâ€™s deck is the LS version of the Brangus Glee manipulator.  He uses ANSB to pull Echo Docking Bays, and then Ketwol for the switching.  I liked his idea.  Anyways, he gets EBO set up the following turn and drops Hoth.  I, on the other hand, got a great start, set up normally, and got out Sienar, 2 TIE Ints to Kiffex and 2 to his Hoth.  His turn, he goes after my TIEs @ Hoth with Draw Their Fire, Frozen Assets, and some scrubs on Liberty.  That one hurt me for about 8 more after forfeiting both Ints.  He sacked a scrub.  My turn: Lateral the Liberty, drop 2 TIE Ints and battle.  He loses the scrubs off Liberty, stacks one.  On his turn, he drops GLiG1, and moves it and Liberty to Wakeelmui.  My turn, I drop DVDLOTS to the North Ridge.  He had had Battle Plan out for a while, so now I was happy to satisfy for that and to cause some Your Destiny damage (he had no Luke).  He tried to kill off DVDLOTS with EPP Obi, but missed the swing and drew low.  I, on the other hand, draw 2 destiny (added 1 w/ Emperorâ€™s power), a 2 + 4, and kill off Obi and make him stack one.  Later, I replace him with Lord Vader.  The game ends with me battling Liberty (still Lateralled) and GLiG1 for the small retrieval and the win.
<br />
<br />
Result: FW by 11; 6(+57)
<br />
Good Things: I held space pretty well.
<br />
Bummers: I forgot about Your Destiny a couple times.
<br />
Compliment of opponent: Feldmanâ€™s a top-caliber player, and every time I play him, I have a good time.  I love the Ketwol manipulator idea; after seeing him play fun games with it, the deck didnâ€™t work right though.  I think Iâ€™ll try to make it work in the near future. 
<br />
<br />
By now, Iâ€™m the only undefeated player.  Iâ€™m feeling really good until the final pairing announcement...
<br />
<br />
Game 4 - LS vs. Alex Stefankoâ€™s Hunt Down
<br />
14 players, and I have to square off last against my @#$%ing little brother.  Irritating...  Alex always plays mainstreamed decks, so games arenâ€™t really fun because all he does is copy them and modify 1-3 cards in the deck to suit his style.
<br />
Anyway, Hunt Down is another deck type that makes for a boring game vs. TIGIH.  He grabbed Luke fast, and set up some big drains in Chirpaâ€™s Hut and CC Docking Bay.  I got character-screwed the entire game; not finding Obi until I lost him to a drain, and not getting my 7 engine going.  Honor got Altered as soon as Luke got capped, so Visage took its toll.  With Search And Destroy out as well, I had no room to maneuver.
<br />
<br />
Result: FL by 21; 6(+36)
<br />
Good Things: none
<br />
Bummers: Playing my brother.
<br />
Compliment of opponent: He made no mistakes.
<br />
<br />
So, after getting slaughtered in Game 4, I get somewhere around 6th place.  My brother won the tournament.
<br />
After some favorable trading and decent prize pulls (weirdly cut BHBM and Anakin Skywalker), I grab my brother and we go home to rest prior to my tournament.
<br />
<br />
At about 5:25p, my brother and I left for Comics &amp; Fantasies, where my tournament was to be held.  At about 6p, we had 7 players, and the crowd was getting restless, so I started the tournament.  10 minutes in, 2 players from San Francisco (Eric Brummel and Nghia Nyugen) show up.  Hurray, sanctioned!  5 minutes after that, 2 more SF players (Chris Leung and Hak Soo Kim) showed up, making the tournament a bigger hit.
<br />
I watched some great games played, and in the end, Kevin Shannon went undefeated and won the tournament.  Hak Soo Kim grabbed 2nd, and Steve Daniel placed 3rd.
