<p>STRADEGY</p>

<p>This Deck uses the Bikers to take control of endor and set up ESB. The bikers By themselves are weak but with trooper assualt they can become 3 power immune to attrition. Thats pretty good. Imp academy training gives them good forfeit with a blaster and makes them shoot with higher destinies. The bikers deploy for 1 have destiny of 3 and will most of the time have good bonuses from a few cards I have placed in this deck. My Scout blasters are very handy firing for free and deploying for free have destiny of 6 thanks to imp academy training</p>

<p>Scout gear gives them an armour of 3 making all in all making them very powerful.</p>

<p>Once you have set up ESB you can drain for 5 on endor and drain for 2â€™s on four different Endor sites. If there drains get larger you can then for extra drains set up drains of 4â€™s and 3â€™s presenting massive drains.</p>

<p>MATCH UPS</p>

<p>Against EBO Set up quickly BY placing one site down and control the three sites you will now have down with biker scouts. pull ESB and start draing as quickly as you can with starships. Make sure you put down enough starships to Fortify Endor. Make sure you have a trooper assuallt. There will be minmal assaults on the ground but Perimiter patrol Should Discourage them from deploying.</p>

<p>Search and destroy will kick @#$% in this game</p>

<p>You should be a lot faster than them to get your drains going so start straight away.</p>

<p>Against Hidden base Again set up the three sites and contol them. Careful they may deploy mains but perimiter patrol will kill any beatdown attempt.</p>

<p>Security precautions will deal with them But only deploy it if there obj is flipped. Just probe and you wont have battle damage but watch out if you find the basecause then you will have battle danage.</p>

<p>Search and destroy will no doubt help you heaps in this game</p>

<p>Your drains will win you this game for sure.</p>

<p>Against Watch your step Your drainage will kill em they wonâ€™t stand a chance.</p>

<p>Careful though there raltirr freighters captains are not rebels so they skip by perimiter patrol.</p>

<p>Against Training Again drain, drain, drain and you will smash em. Even their retrievel wonâ€™t stand a chance against large drains like this.</p>

<p>Against I can Save him Hold as many bikers in hand and a trooper assaults and then beatdown luke. They wonâ€™t be expexting a large betdown from inperials so you should hack away their Reserve deck from that single battle. If not use the guns to take out any scouts, spys, or chewbaccas as you can.</p>

<p>This deck has been tested  and has gone underfeated at my state tournament for the second time now. If you think this deck sucks you suck because this deck rocks. You try win states two times in a row with the same deck, not to mention the many games played in between.</p>

<p>If your going rate this deck low give a proper and legitimate reason or I shall just erase your rating. Its that Easy.</p>
