<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Well this is a Court Deck that CAN flip but DOES NOT NEED TOâ€¦..so dont give me junk reviews saying I need to add a bunch of other junk to make the flipping viable.</p>

<p>Start Scum and Villiany against EVERYTHING. Use the AC game text to grab Ak-Rev your first turn and use him to grab another musician. Against Profit they convert your sites but its coolâ€¦â€¦.Start Ak-Rev and Mara. The first musician youll want in Greeata followed by Rappertunie and Lirin Carn. Lirin is absolutely devastating as he adds to deployment and movent to the AC. Rappertunie youll want second so they have to pay extra to battle.</p>

<p>Drain at Endor and Kashyyyk with your bounty hunter shipsâ€¦.if they die, start the continous retrieval loop(Zuckuss dies, drop Fett from Reserve, battle, and retrieve Zuckuss, wash and repeat).</p>

<p>You can piss them off by making them pay so much more for thier mains and then Barriering them and Disarming them. If you want to flip, look for your bounty hunters and start capturing with IG-88 and All Wrapped Up. After you flip, look for the Sarlacc and jump on a skiff(also useful for reacting all over Tatooine)and sit on it and have it attack during your control phase. The deck can win without it so dont trip if you dont flip. Sniper Artoo and Boussh as soon as they hit table.</p>

<p>What to do</p>

<p>vs. Profit Start Mara and Ak-Rev as stated above and grab musicians. Fill up the AC and spread in space and retrieve every time you battle. 4-LOM for Luke and Ben as well as Disarm them too. Capture mains when neededâ€¦.flipping can be very advantageous here.</p>

<p>vs. Ops Twilek for Battle Order ASAP. Jump on a Skiff and head over to the Ops planet to battle and retrieve. Have Ak-Rev grab musicians for you but deploy them to the ops planet instead.Dont worry if your guys die chances are theyll get retrieved.</p>

<p>vs. HB Twilek for Battle Order and Security ASAP. Deploy you fleet cautiously ONLY after they flip and watch for Rebel Barrier. Probe quickly and spread on ground but not too thin and rain them and Sniper the spies.</p>

<p>vs. Y4 Tough match-up, but you have the ups in the early run. Umpass-Stay is a spy and Ak-Rev lets you grab him, in addition there are 3 Maras and Bubo in the deck, so invade Yavin fast and furiously. You may want to keep a few guys at Tatooine to prevent Objective damage and make them go there and worry about Yavin at the same time. Take over space and drain thereâ€¦.but DONT deploy Bossk unless you lost one of the other onesâ€¦.Landing Claw aint pretty. If they go to Tatooine, go for the flip and feed the Sarlacc.</p>

<p>vs. anything else Numbers youve got Resistanceâ€¦.so Signal for it first beyond all else.This deck should be pretty self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Any comments and suggestions are welcome and please, review this deck seriously.</p>
