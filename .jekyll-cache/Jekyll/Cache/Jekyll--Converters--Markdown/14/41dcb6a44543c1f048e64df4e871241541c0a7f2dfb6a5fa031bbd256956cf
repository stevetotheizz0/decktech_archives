<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what you do. On the first turn you should drop either a Palpy or Merrejk at the docking bay 327.  You pull corulag with mobilization points and if you dropped merrejk, pull another battleground system. Also drop a system if you have one in your starting hand.  On second turn you have 3 force from Death Star, 1 from palpy if heâ€™s on table, 3 from docking bay because you should control it and it gets +2 if you control it from mobilization points, 2 from corulag, and another 2 from any other system you dropped.  Thatâ€™s a total of 12 force. If Merrejk is on table pull another system (do this almost every turn). Youâ€™ll be able to drop a lot of ships with all the force you have and you wonâ€™t have to pay to drain because you occupy the docking bay and a battleground system. You pretty much just battle and drain the rest of the way.</p>

<p>Against EBO
  You should be able to take this out because youâ€™ll have a lot of space to block your opponentâ€™s drains and you should be able to out battle your opponent.</p>

<p>Against There is good in him
  Pretty much just out drain your opponent in space and if he comes into space battle him off the table.</p>

<p>Against Mind what you have learned
  You shouldnâ€™t have a problem be cause you donâ€™t have a lot of drain bonuses and can out battle him in space.</p>

<p>Agains Mains and toys
  Let your opponent have the ground youâ€™ll have space and if he drops a super falcon just drop Dengar in P1 and some other ships to take it out.</p>

<p>Against Xwing swarm
  Thereâ€™s a reason why I use Interceptors.</p>

<p>Against hidden base
  Just take over space and probe the systems.</p>

<p>Against Profit
  Battle order should slow your opponent down and youâ€™ll be draining big in space which is way more than his direct damage. If he drops The celebration just go take over Tattoine and cancel it.</p>

<p>That should be eough for you to see that this deck can combat most of the decks out there. I hope you will have fun if you play this deck.</p>
