My regular monthly tournament.  The first after the official
<br />
release of the Death Star II expansion set.  Many people were nervous to see how much DS2 would affect the tournament scene, but everyone arrived ready to play.  We even had 5 players brand new to the local tournament scene, so we made sure they left with lots of good stuff as well as knowledge and suggestions to perfect their game.  This may have been the last local tournament for a 3-year regular, Bart Robinson, who will be moving to near Chicago early next month.  In cleaning and packing, he brought over 2000 commons and uncommons in a big box which were given to McGarity brothers to help them beef up their collection.  Also a pleasant surprise was TJ Holman, who had been lying low for the last few months with other commitments.  We also had 5 other guys show up just to pick up their boxes of DS2 and to trade.  
<br />
<br />
I also introduce a new statistic to this report, the "Fun Factor."  This is the average difference of cards during games, win or lose.  The rationale being a close game is a fun game.  The lower the number, supposedly the more fun the player had.  This is opposed to either blowing out or being blown out by a big differential.  On to the statistics:
<br />
<br />
Light Side Wins:    	21
<br />
Dark Side Wins:     	21
<br />
Average Differential:  	22
<br />
<br />
Deck types were varied, with no operatives or numbers seen at all (go figure!!)  EBO, ISB, Hunt Down, Hidden Base, Mains and Toys, some space with matching pilots and stuff (both sides).  The broken Super Rallops deck was not to be seen, but old-school Rops was played.  There was even a "Blow up the Bunker" LS deck!!
