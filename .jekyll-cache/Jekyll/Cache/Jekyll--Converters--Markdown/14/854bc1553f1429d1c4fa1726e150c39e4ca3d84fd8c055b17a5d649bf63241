<p>First Off, Thanks to everyone for the positive feedback on my original posting.  The deck is performing better, now if only I could play smarter.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll address a few things
Bog Clearingâ€¦ I donâ€™t own one, I canâ€™t find one, so Iâ€™m not playing oneâ€¦ unfortunate, but thatâ€™s the way it is for me -(
I find the deck functions well with just 4 Dagobah locations, as long as you recognize the order they should come out in.  Get them down in this order (placement wise).  Hut/Jungle/Training Area/Swamp, Test 1 is done on either the Hut or the Training Area (assuming that Jungle isnâ€™t out) Test 2 should be placed on the Jungle, that way you can finish test 3 fast and deploy test 4 the next turn.</p>

<p>One thing that Iâ€™m slowly learning about this deck, is that once you have finished test 3 GO PICK A FIGHT.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure what else to say, again if you have any advice, feel free to offer it, as this deck is still losing on a fairly regular basis, but Iâ€™m not playing it that well I think. â€˜</p>
