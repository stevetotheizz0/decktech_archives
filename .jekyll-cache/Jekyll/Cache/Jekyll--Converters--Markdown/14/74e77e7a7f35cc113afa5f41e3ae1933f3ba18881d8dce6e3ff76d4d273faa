I"¦<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">OK, after a long Saturday night, I woke up around 9am and finished putting
<br />
up signs directing people to the Sunday location of RCon - the H-wing
<br />
Auditorium.  I get there and the tables are not set up so George Gundry,
<br />
Mike Publicover, and Johnny Rivera (someone else too...cannot remember)
<br />
help me out and we get set up.  People start to come in and then Rich
<br />
shows up even though he wasn&amp;#8217;t supposed to.  He tells me he calls in sick
<br />
;) so he can play!  Great news for me, the more competition, the more fun
<br />
it is for me at least to watch.  So after all is said and done prepping
<br />
for the tournament, 36 people show up and form 8 different teams of 4.  We
<br />
discussed making this event sanctioned but then realized we will
<br />
manipulate the pairings and that makes it unsanctioned.  It works out
<br />
better for everyone because that way people could have more fun with it.
<br />
I know that Bob Caton played a experimental deck 'for the heck of
<br />
it because it was non sanctioned.  Plus all the incentive people needed
<br />
was the Trophies I had up for grabs.  First place was to get the Endor Set
<br />
of foils and once again I used George Gundry's idea of getting posters
<br />
signed.  I had 3 up for grabs for this one.  The competition was stiff
<br />
with lots of very good players.  After about 45 minutes, two people, Neil
<br />
Hoffman and Ivan Turner from Staten Island show up in time for the second
<br />
round.  Bart was gracious enough to switch teams to play with them and we
<br />
now had 7 teams of 4 and 2 teams of 3.

So in all the event went great with everyone's help. I kind of messed up
<br />
the pairing 3 times! ;).  Chris Twig won the overall best score and earned
<br />
the Endor Set of foils.  Team Charlie&amp;#8217;s Angels won the team tournament with
<br />
the trophies and the Team Champ T-shirts.  Afterwards I raffled off 10
<br />
support.  I also had 38 more foils to give away that everyone had to pick
<br />
face down.
<br />
<br />
Props-
<br />
-Rich Haman helping me with the command cards throughout the entire event
<br />
so I would not mess the pairings again ;).
<br />
-Bart Robinson for switching teams when part of a team showed up.
<br />
-Aaron Kingery and Arthur Wright for helping Rich and I figure the team
<br />
tournament results in the 'special room'
<br />
-Doug Faust, Ray Bordier for helping throughout the day.
<br />
-The people randomly following my arrows on campus thinking I was holding
<br />
the 'Open House'
<br />
-Everyone for playing!
<br />
-Everyone for signing my cards in my Light Side Deck!
