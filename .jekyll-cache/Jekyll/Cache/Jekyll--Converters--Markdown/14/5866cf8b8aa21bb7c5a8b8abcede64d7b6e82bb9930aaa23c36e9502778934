<br />
<br />
Well all week steebo and i had been planning to go to fitchburg to play with the mass players, but we found out that noone was even going to fitchburg and we doubted that eight people would show up.  We were still going to go until we found out that a tournament in CT was giving out tatooine cards and spoilers the same day, and we decided to make a trip out of it.  So Eric Hunter calls us up before we make the decision, becuase he needs our emporers to play Dark Surgeon.  We tell him we are going to fitchburg, and keep playtesting.  Steebo had been testing Retardasaurus Rex all week, but i had been taking it out with Ten Numb Supertar every time, So he decided to play with ROPS.
<br />
<br />
So friday night, we hit KFC/Taco Bell, and the girl behind the counter is all flirting with me and steve gets mad at me b/c i am a sarcastic bastard to counter help.  I think its funny but he thinks its rude.  Let me just tell you that the kid that kicked in some guys shincaps in england is calling me rude for questioning why the KFC in worcester didnt carry corn bread.  So we playtest all night friday, and my steebo is pissed because we get there after my sister left for her prom, he wanted to see her in the dress.  But all in all my sister is a retard, i know i mention her a lot because i think its funny, but i hate my sister so much.  Sheâ€™s one of those high maintenence girls, so selfish, always glued to her cellphone.  She wont even walk the dog beyond our driveway.  That and she takes my car everywhere.  Why am i telling you this??? because i just got into a fight with her and its on my mind.. so screw.
<br />
<br />
Saturday morning comes, we take the newly gassed up Obsidian 69 and head for the boarder.  The ride is pretty uneventful, they usually are.  Steebo was nodding off a lot, and i was just trying to find a good radio station in connecticut, because there arent any.  We end up making great time, getting there in 1:15 and we arrive early and have to wait in the parking lot for people to show up.  I let steebo drive my car in the lot which is a mistake, because the kid cant drive for @#$%, but hes only 15 so what can you do?  
<br />
<br />
So everyone gets there, and radke wont show us the tatooine cards until after the tourney, which is gay b/c i wanted to see what â€™end of a reignâ€™ did, if you want to know check out the bottom of this TR.  Steve was going to play the ISB but couldnt get his hands on a fourth imp. command, so he had to go with Biker Rops, even though Brentson threw ounee ta in his deck once he found out steve was there.  I am playing my trusty bring him up the anus.  For light we are both playing QMC - Ten Numb Superstar.  His rating dropped like 30 from last week to 1947.  I went up 63 points from last week to 1717.  ON TO THE Fâ€™N GAMES.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1: My BHBM Anus vs. B. Hollingworthâ€™s HB Mains
<br />
well, i had this matchup last week.  Brian was the CT state runner up this year, and last week i had beaten him by 32.  However, now he knew what to expect from the sevens and beatdown crews that would follow.  I won a battle early on, yet i guess i forgot to make him stack a card, even though i thought i told him to.  That ended up hurting in the late game.  I did go on to win a few more battles, however in the process, i lost just about every duel i had against him, which slowed my game down a lot.  I was able to come down and capture Ben and beat down on some other characters with IG.  But he was spreading out and avoiding me so it turned into a small drain race, but in the end i was able to pull out the win, but not by much.  This was the first game, and iâ€™m a little shady on details, which is pretty unlike me.  I just know that i forgot to stack that card, and in the end won after not winning any duels, but pulled it out by 13 cards
<br />
FW 2(+18)
<br />
<br />
Highs: Winning against a guy i stole 40 rating points from last week
<br />
Lows: not winning any duels, forgetting to stack a card for the first time.
<br />
<br />
Baroni won his game, luckily we did not have to play... yet.  I ended up playing Pat Henderson, who had the bye.  I really dont know how i got stuck playing the kid with the bye, but i guess i won by the least amount.  I beleive steve had to play Brentson for the first time at this point, though im not sure.
<br />
<br />
Game 2 my QMC vs. Pat Hendersons BHBM
<br />
This game i am a little shady on as well, i do know that it lasted about 5 minutes.  This game was pretty bad, i set up a few ships at bespin, and he started dropping bounty hunters to cloud city, namely bossk, zuckuss and 4lom.  I think he had Vader and tarkin out also.  Well i dodged away from his battles at first, and then i used path to sorry about the mess vader with ben, and then i dropped leia, han, tawss and run luke runâ€™d over to smack tarkin for a LOT of force, i think it was 24 with all my destinies and power.  Then i was able to do the same thing, SATMing Zuckuss and beating up on bossk and 4lom with luke, and drawing a 6 for destiny.  He had to top alot then too.  From there on in i spread out and drained.  I didnt even get to start retreiving with celelbration before he was out of cards, yet i had 31 left.
<br />
FW 4 (+49)
<br />
<br />
Highs: Smacking Tarkin, winning by enough to take the first round
<br />
Lows: not getting to retreive all my cards back.
<br />
<br />
So i won the round, allowing me to later pick which tatooine light card that would be spoiled, among the many others spoiled that day.  The only thing about winning the round is, that if i won only two people could have taken second, baroni or brentson... unlucky for me it was brentson.  Luckily for me i got to play my light against his Hunterâ€™s ISB, which i ahd beaten all week when steebo was playing it.  
<br />
<br />
Game 3 My QMC vs Brentsons Hunerâ€™s ISB
<br />
This game was retarded.  We both had all of our ships at bespin, but neither one of us would battle.  Although the game wouldnt go anywhere because he was draining for more than i was, and i was retreiving for less than he was draining.  After SATMing arica, i lost my other SATM off the top, which invited that GAY ISB droid to come down and make all my drains -1, then i had no choice but to battle.  Here is where i made the biggest mistake of my career.  I retreived a run luke run. and i shouldve tracked it better, i knew it was near the top, but i got WAY to anxious at taking out dengar in ship to get my immunity back, and i shot at him first, instead of firing one of my 3 intruder missiles at the executr, because my first draw was a 1 at dengar.  My first draw against teh executor was 6.. meaning if i had taken the first two shots i had at the executor, i wouldve made it go lost instead of reducing its power to zero with my executor.  I missed with my third intruder missile as well, and invited myself for a major beatdown by brentsons wrecking crew of space.  he drained me out, and when all was said and done he had be by 13.
<br />
FL 4(+36)
<br />
<br />
Highs: None
<br />
Lows: The battle in space.
<br />
<br />
SO this pits me against baroni for the fourth game, and what would prove to be the worst game ive ever played in the history of my career as a starwars player.  After all that i have done the last few months to get my rating up, to be a better player, this kid, my friend reduced me to a pile of feces.
<br />
<br />
But before i get to that, me and baroni and klema went to lunch at Mcdonalds.  And i was macked on by the girlees behind the counter and they were scoping me of course, but to no avail because they were boot nasty.  Steebo is poor as hell, almost as poor as me and i had to buy him lunch, and he wanted supersize, hes a p.o.s. but what are you going to do.  I won a free cone on my millionaire fries, normally i just scratch off all the prizes to see how much money i couldve won, but screw it, it was hot and i wanted some ouce cream.  We get back on time, which isnt normal for us and round four... FIGHT!
<br />
<br />
Game 4 BHBM Anus vs Baronis QMC
<br />
heres the game right here.  Eylk Rhue in ship at cloud city.  He leaves a force.  I think hes bluffing.  I have zuckuss and bossk in my opening hand.  I have no patience, so i go after him.  He gets barrierd.  Luckily for me steebo isnt activating 11 force so he can only bring down han in falcon with ten numb in it instead of leia.  Giving him a 2 destiny draws.  I lose 14 off the top.  After that, there isnt much i can do.  He spreads out on cloud city, i go after osme of his guys, and he dodges or paths away, who knows.  And then comes down with the path, drop drop run luke run combo and smakcs me again.  he gets celebration going and retreives everything i made him lose.  He was smart by not giving me luke, but he made the deck and he should know.  and i lose by 44... yes 44 everyone else was in amazement as well
<br />
FL 4(-8)
<br />
<br />
Highs: @#$% you
<br />
Lows : 4 @#$%in 4
<br />
<br />
So that drops me a lot and i enter the mini sea of jizz that is the connecticut 1500 rating players.  However, i know im better than i played last game and i can still go 4-2 for the third time in a row
<br />
<br />
Game 5 My QMC vs some kid that steebo kept making fun ofâ€™s COURT
<br />
Personally, i think court is a pretty poor deck.  Iâ€™ve seen some good ones, and iâ€™ve seen some bad ones.  But mainly, my QMC shuts down these drain decks based on Tattoine and the celebration gets all my force back that i lose from the ping and the drains.  Well, the kid gets down EPP Fett and the Evazan combo to the cantina and mara with presence to jabbas palace with Jabba and some other guy at the audience chamber.  I am just draining and have dash and elyk rhue at bespin.  After a while I spread out in the air and celebrate but i cant take the 3 drain plus the ping, because i cant find obi wan or my last site to drain and retreive for one extra a turn.  I drop epp luke with han on the falcon to the tat dbay and move htem over to the cantina to block the drain and draw up leaving two force.  When they try and battle me i narrow escape over.  During my turn i drop epp leia and he moves his guys over in front of me.  battle cleaning house and only losing han.  he drops guri during his turn I drop han during mine.  He drops Xizor and battles, i cant hurt xizor so i chop up guri, draw my destinies and clear the site, he draws a zero for destiny so iâ€™m hunky dorey.  I move my guys over to the other docking bay, making my way slowly over to mara at JP.  Finally i move over there after he puts some more guys there like bossk or dengar or something and he defensive fires me.  I have a barrier a power pivot and a narrow escape, but narrow escape will save me the game because there was something there that would allow him to beat me down i forget what though.  Luckily he gets the barrier, and i narrow escape allowing myself to drain him out that final turn after retreiving an extra four to put my life force at 26.
<br />
FW 6(+14)
<br />
<br />
Highs: winning by alot.  My Han to falcon on tat tech.
<br />
Lows : none really.
<br />
<br />
So going into the last game my diff is still pretty low.  Baroni lost to brentson again so he is playing Klema who is awesome yet is somehow 2-3 going into the last game.  I play the kid i played in game 1 last week, who i beat by 37 with my QMC, this time iâ€™m playing the anus and i think itâ€™ll be an easy matchup until he starts RST, which is a crappydeck to play against any day of the week.
<br />
<br />
Game 6 My BHBM Anus vs RST Scouts
<br />
The kid starts stacking everything at the rebel landing site while i get out the emporer.  I started with two docking bays so i was set up fast, activating a lot of force and drawing a lot.  I drew up two turns in a row after getting vader that first turn.  I ended up with all three maraâ€™s in my hand, ig, fett , counter assault, janus and reacter terminal and 6 sevens.  So i figured i had two turns before he would spread out and flip making his drains uncancellable.  I figured i had a pretty good beatdown squad if that happend, but i wanted to counter assault those damn scouts.  so i put evertthing back and track those sevens back to the top.  I think he has seven guys there, and i have 6 sevens tracked, so i figure one blind draw that could be a 1 would be fine.  I play counter assault and he says 8.  so im like @#$% that wont be as good, but do it anyawys.  Well my Six Sevens come up and i get two blind draws SEVEN AND SEVEn.  SO my counter assault total is 56.  his total power at the site is 26 (although at first he said 36 i had to recount fo rhim) and he lost 30 off the top, he only had 29 cards so i won by 30.
<br />
FW 8(+44)
<br />
<br />
Highs: Counter assaulting for 56, going 4-2 again
<br />
Lows : having like 6 cards in my hand when it happened
<br />
<br />
So baroni beats klema, going 4-2 with 51 diff.  Klema goes 2-4.  We have to wait for hollingworthâ€™s game to finish, if he loses we take 2nd and third and thus both the light and dark podracers plus the interrupts plus the epic event plus some other cool podracing stuff like other podracers.  But alas, hollingworth wins by 11 and we go 3-4.  Which isnt bad as i win a palace raider so thats pretty cool
<br />
<br />
Now for tattoine spoilers.
<br />
<br />
There is an effect that lets Aurra sing go around, cannot be battled if she is alone at a site.  Draw destiny, if destiny is &gt;3 then she steals a lightsaber.  and her gametext lets her use lightsabers and stuff. so thats good.  shes like arica in this sense.
<br />
<br />
There is a lightside interrupt that when used for its used ability, you can use 4 force to cancel vaders gamtext, and its lost ability does something when vader and emp are together.  This card has the illest picture of all the cards, and is called end of a reign.
<br />
<br />
There is a ligthside interrupt that lets you damage podracers.  It also does something else but is pretty lame.
<br />
<br />
One of the darkside podracers that we won, allows you to sacrifice it to repair Sebulbaâ€™s podracer.
<br />
<br />
The podrace arena has 1 icon on each side.
<br />
<br />
Not all of these i took from the tourney, others i just knew and waited to share.  I do have more spoilers.  Dmail me if you want them.
<br />
<br />
