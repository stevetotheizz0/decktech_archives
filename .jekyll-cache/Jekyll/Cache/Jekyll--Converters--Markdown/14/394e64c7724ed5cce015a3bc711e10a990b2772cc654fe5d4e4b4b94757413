<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>during the first few turns, all you want to do is draw force. only deploy non- battleground sites so that your opponent cannot force drain you or prevent you from accomplishing dark deal.  be extremely cautious about deploying any cloud city site until you can either hold the site or accomplish dark deal.  as high destinies are important to this deck, try and get a reactor terminal as quickly as you can. if you donâ€™t get the dark deal in your first had then I would use the twiâ€™lek advisor to get it out.  If you already have the dark deal the use it to get the reactor terminal out. once you accomplish dark deal, then continue cycling the high destinies back into your deck. if your opponent is stupid enough to deploy to cloud city then carbon freeze them (you have 3 so thatâ€™s 24 force - a major loss)  use the all wrapped up to capture all the forfeited characters.  if your opponent deploys a luke then use the emperorâ€™s prize to cut their deck in half.</p>

<p>if you think that this deck is weak in space then  cosider this.  if you have obsidian 2 and virago piloted by ds 72 10 at bespin, cloud city.  that means your deploy is 7 , power is 11 and you draw 2 battle destinies.  that means that if you draw 2 7â€™s, then your power is 25</p>
