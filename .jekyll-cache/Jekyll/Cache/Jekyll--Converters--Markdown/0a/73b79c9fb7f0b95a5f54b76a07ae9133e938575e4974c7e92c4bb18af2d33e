<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>This deck is real quick, depending on what your opponentâ€™s locations are, pull either hoth or Endor first (usually endor, move right away and get a drain going) If they are playing ground heavy - flip ASAP and start draining and blocking their drains with the spy the arcona (be wary) and the Obj. If they are playing space (ties-scyfa) go ahead and let them grab your All wings or Organized attacks - BUT DONT LET THEM GRAB YOUR HYPER ESCAPE, this coupled with OTE will eat your opponent up. - The beauty of this deck is the squadrons - you can recycle your X-wings, by replacing them with the squadron. You can then forfeit the squadron to the docking and repair facility (if needs be)- and then replace some x-wings next turn - Throw Haven on Hoth or Yavin4 and deploy your X-wings for free - Now your are probably wondering why I would start insurrection? This throws the opponent off, they think a HB mains deck - but the real reason is it increases your forfeit on the cheap scrub pilots, and also a place to go once S&amp;D hits the table. - - Late game you can retrieve with All wings or kessel run - (using Han, Boshek or wedge)</p>

<p>I dont really like giving, a match up for each deck archetype - cause every Meta-game is soooooo different.
But to please all the critics, I will try and give some brief scenarios.</p>

<p>BHBM Give Luke right away - You will be able to win in space and be able to cancel their drains, and you will be out draining like MAD - If search&amp;Destroy hits the table, go on some suicide strikes with Ben and Han - or build up a force at the SP docking bay.</p>

<p>Hunt Down - Out drain - cancel drains - pretty easy match up - I used to have 2 trans terminated in this deck. But Huntdown isnt all that popular in my area right now.</p>

<p>Ralops  Non-existent  - Nobody plays this anymore. But if they do - grab Yavin4 right away and put Havin on it - deploy your X-wings for free and move them over to Raltir - Prevent your opponent from flipping - in the meantime spread out and start to drain - deploy your mains directly to Raltir for dirt cheap (Ounee Ta) - and let OTE work them over.</p>

<p>TIES  Grab their All power to weapons - the will grab your organized attack - Hyper escape and OTE will win this game for you - it has for me, on many occasions. Try and make surgical strikes against their dreadnoughts - and flipping your obj, is up to you - depending on the way the game is going - you can decide.</p>

<p>MKOS / Court This will be the most difficult match up - MKOS prevents you from canceling their force drains so you will have to use the Arcona and boushh - and just try and outdrain and make some surgical strikes, with your big guns.
	Court Same thing, only difference is this time you can block drains, but you will be losing to S&amp;D 	and the OBj - and dont bother with boushh - hutt smooch will take her out. So drain right away	and smash them if they come to space</p>

<p>So thats it - play with this deck, let me know how you like it - its very quick, and like I said its adaptable. So rate on the adaptability  â€”â€”â€”â€“D-mail me if you have any questions
