<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>4-0 at the regional beating both Michael Riboulet and Gary Carman.</p>

<hr />
<p>Mains duel when you have tracked. protect visage with holonets. if they come out somewhere else ig88 can take out a few characters. mara and dr e can help too. the deck is self explanitory</p>

<p>Ops Start Battle Order. Get Vader out ASAP. Get the Holotable out for activation and a drain before they flip. Beat down on ships in the late game. Use other characters to fight and Vader to duel if you can.</p>

<p>HB get out Vader ASAP. Get Mara to the CC DB and get Search and Destroy goin.</p>

<p>Profit Just like Mains but start with Dr E and Mara.</p>

<p>That is how it works. Always start IAO, except against ops.</p>

<p>Michael Kessling
Naboo regional runner-up.</p>
