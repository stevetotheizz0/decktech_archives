I"	(<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">In the flood of DCon TRs, if you can find mines, READ IT. Youll have a good time, I promise. TR from Folsom this week, TR happens NOW.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Prelude
<br />
<br />
I almost concluded NOT to write a TR about this tourney, seeing as how this weekend was possibly one of the worst weekends I have ever had....youll see later. After weeks of searching for the foil ultra-rare finisher for Triple H(Pedigree) for the Raw Deal CCG, one of my contacts online finally manages to get a hold of one. Letting me know first, I managed to haggle him down from $45.00 to $35.00(crazy ebay bidders).....when a resident TD, Robert Selby, tells me he has one for trade. Looking to save money, I agree to meet him at Folsom for what was one of Mike Hardy’s final tournaments. 
<br />
<br />
Looking for a ride was easy. Turning to Steve Daniel again, we meet up at my place Saturday morning, play a few games with my new decks, and after horribly crushing Steve both times, we decide to go pick up the new 98 Degrees CD, Revalations.....(I love slow jams) and take off for Lodi, where Kyle Ishimaru allowed us to spend the evening.
<br />
<br />
The drive over to Lodi was LONG and most of all BORING. Anyone wanting to go down to Sacto from the Bay Area, take my advice.....DONT. 98 Degrees puts us to sleep, so my friend puts on Limp Bizkit.....Im shocked as to how I wasnt introduced to this guy before....violent, loud and destructive....gotta love it. We finally make it to Kyles house after a million turns to find his street.....the idiot lives in a mansion and he always pleads bankruptcy every time I see him. But taking into account this was Lodi, possibly the worst ditch in California, I dont blame him.
<br />
<br />
We stay over at his place and play ALOT of games. I crush everyone at SW, and Steve feared Kyle, so that ended after awhile. Things get etchy when we play Star Wars Monopoly(what a joke), and The Emporer(Kyle) cleans out Boba Fett(Steve). We eat possibly what was the worst pizza ever, and talk strat and stuff all night. Realizing its 6 A.M., we decide to put off sleeping all together, and help Steve change his CCT idea to a Hunt Down deck that at least had the chance to win a game. Heres where things turn bad.....
<br />
<br />
Kyles father has a power trip and decides he cant go because he stayed up late. On top of that, he kicks Steve and myself out at 9:15 A.M. so his candyass could go to church and drag Kyle with him. Taking off from Kyles, Steve and I head to worst McDonalds EVER for breakfast. Im starting to feel the effects of staying over at Kyles because of his cat(which Im slightly allergic to), and my eyes start getting red AFTER I leave his house. We find out that Folsom is over an hour from Lodi, something Kyle forgot to mention when we were over there. 
<br />
<br />
We drive down to Folsom from Lodi, and the road turns from a dirt farm to a city in no time flat. We finally arrive at the store, after getting lost 5 times thanks to Folsom’s many streets with the same name. The store turned out to be a craphole in the middle of a craphole town.....great. At this point, Im feeling pretty sick and I dont even care about the tourney anymore, so long as Rob shows up with the Pedigree. We wait for about 2 hours thanks to Kyles dad making us leave that early....and we get only 7 people and Rob and Mike showing up 30 minutes late. I talk to Rob.....he DOESNT HAVE IT....his friend has it. Great.....and that will COMPLETE THE CRAP WEEKEND. Well, two other people finally show up about an hour late, including the girl who gave my BHBM its only loss, so we decide to stay and play, and I figure I can at least beat her @$$ for revenge.

Decks
<br />
<br />
LS - HB Fakeout Smackdown with max activation, lots of beats, and a scout twist to the classic mains for LS.
<br />
<br />
DS - Yannick Lapointes "The Machine"......usually I dont copy decks outright, but I had no time or energy to mod it.
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Game
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1: DS vs. Derek’s LS Rescue the Princess "May I’ll get her maybe not"
<br />
<br />
This guy was obviously new, making a Rescue the Princess that DOESNT rescue the princess. Appearantly, he tries to drain you out the Death Star....great. Anyways, Emporer out to Yavin 4 first turn, but his EPP Luke first turn kills him(lucky hack). I drop Lord Vader w/ saber the following turn, and move him to the War Room. He comes down with a small scout beatdown....Orrimaarko, Blount, Beezer, and 2 more 2/2 scrubs and initiates. I YABeaten Orrimaarko and hack up Blount, draw low destiny and kill off another scout and all I have to do is lose 2 force. He used up all his force so the other 2 cant run. My turn, I Sniper one of them, and only Beezer is left that can battle. I drop Mara, Sim and Jabba and battle to cause him about 20 force from the beatdown. From there, he hands Vader Luke, and drops Obi and his saber to the Death Star for a measly drain, and I end it soon thereafter. Win by 23.
<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 2(+23)
<br />
Highs: Starting off good
<br />
Lows: Beating the tar outta a new player....starting to feel the effects of no sleep.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2: LS vs. Chris Green’s DS SYCFA Interceptors
<br />
<br />
Chris starts things off first turn with a lone Interceptor to Sullust. I grab my docking bay and slap Crix Madine there. He drains, and sets up on Endor. I convert Endor, drop Gen Cal on Falcon to Sullust, he barriers, and I follow up with Tantive and Blount to kill off the TIE while he Ghhhks. He drains for 1, and sets up on Kiffex. I send Home One there to clear out and he Ghhhks again. He draws up for the next few turns while I set up Luke and his saber at the Back Door for some drains. He Laterals Home One, and drops a Dread and the Emporers Power for a small beatdown, but I Alter the Lateral, sense the All Powers, and kill off the Dreadnaught. I smack the Power down for 6 the next turn, and he proceeds and draws for another Lateral, something he never finds, and I hit him for 7 for the rest of the game to win it. Win by 12.
<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 4(+35)
<br />
Highs: Nothing much
<br />
Lows: Getting sleepy....
<br />
<br />
<br />
Im starting to get hungry, but the area has no place to eat that one can walk to, so I stay at the store. Im in the lead, and I notice theres a shirt for the winner, so I actually start to care about winning.....the shirt would at least put a glimpse of light into the dreaded weekend so far.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3: DS vs. Paul McKelveys LS DBO "I wanna be like Raltiir" Scouts
<br />
<br />
He tried to play this exactly as one would play RalOps, but everyone knows they just dont compare. Emporer invades Dantooine early to avoid the early flip. He comes down with 2 more sites and drops down with Crix at a Dbay and scouts at other Dantooine sites.....he drops in front on Emporer, and a battle pursues, where Emporer gets shot by a neighboring scout and his gun with a 6. I come down with Vader to the Spaceport City, where he has General Solo and Beezer. I YABeaten Solo and proceed to smack Beezer(again) and cause him about 7 force. From there, I go with Emporer and Janus to the Endor dbay, and move Vader to the Farm to outdrain him, while Sensing and Altering every red he tries to get off. Some space fights ensue, but nothing much of importance. Win by 13. 
<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 6(+48)
<br />
Highs: The Machine truly IS a machine
<br />
Lows: Nothing much....
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4: LS vs. That girl’s brother’s(Andrew I think) HD Huntdown Dueler
<br />
<br />
So I dont play that girl, but I get her brother.....same family, same buisiness. I get the GOD hand and junk out with both my Dbays, Hoth war room, and Endor with Crix first turn for max activation. He comes down with the Endor Dbay and picks up some. We both lose to Visage and I activate for tons and draw....I find EPP Han and EPP Leia to go with the Jedi Luke and saber already in my hand, and the Endor Chewie thanks to Crix. He drops Lord Vader and his stick to Endor. I activate, draw some, and find Lost in the Wilderness. He drains, Vader goes for a safari tour. Down comes Emporer and he hopes to find him. I respond with Luke and stick, EPP Han, EPP Leia, and Endor Chewie with Your Insights and I fight. He searches for I Have You Now. I miss the hack on Emporer, and Han misses, but Leia hits him with the 6. I play Insertion and we draw destinies.....he draws a 0, 1, 2.....equals zero with Insertion....I draw a 6, 5, and a 0 for a total of 32 power to 4. He immediately scoops up to give me the 30 card victory. Smart boy. Win by 30.
<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8(+78)
<br />
Highs: Revenge at its fullest
<br />
Lows; Nothing much....
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well thats all great and over........At least I won this tourney to put some sort of light on this otherwise @$$ weekend.  I got a pack of Japanese Primiere(Leesub Sirlin or whatever was the rare.....got Jundland Wastes and Prophetess....ok I guess), alot of Crap City and a Baron Sontiir Fel shirt(a Mike Hardy Production) what was reversed.....that was cool. I use up my $25.00 credit at the craphole store because I’m never going back there.....got some magazines, some sleeves and both Tribbles starters for Trek(they had NO Wars). 
<br />
<br />
We leave the store and Im about ready to pass out. We head to Carls Jr., stock up on gas, and head out for the long journey home. Both of us are pretty much out, and we nearly die like 5 times on the road back......but thats another story. 
<br />
<br />
So what have I learned this week? 
<br />
<br />
Lodi sucks.
<br />
<br />
other than that, nothing much.
<br />
<br />
and that is THE GAME.......
