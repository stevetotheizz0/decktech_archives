 Well it was a cool Saturday morning, May 20th. I got up at 6:30.. three hours sleep yay. I spent a good portion of the night trying to tweak my decks with help from people from the Decipher Palace (in hindsight they didn't help much) I had to leave pretty early catching a bus (seeing the tournament was in the middle of nowhere) and meeting my buddy Kyle Klepy at a bus station. So anyway we got there (almost missed the place) and me and Klepy got pulled away from trading to set up the place by the cranky store owner (we weren't even at his store) so we set up got yelled at by the old guy and then finally pulled ourselves away to make sure our decks were solid (they sure weren't but Klepy didn't notice this). I noticed all the guys there who would probably school me in the ways of getting my ass kicked (Clint Hays, Yannick Lapointe, Matt Sokol, Raphael Asselin, Steve Brentson, Jonathan Chu and Brian Twigg, there were more but not it's just becoming a long list in total there were 38 players in the tournament. Well we started late (this isn't anything special around here we haven't started on time since 97) and I got paired against a local random pairings my ass.

 Game 1: My Ral Ops vs John Cain's Tosche Harvest Mains
<br />
<br />
  Well I used my natural bad feeling start, my hand had 2 2/2 for 2 scrubs a jungle, Oppressive Enforcement, Alter Boba's ship and few non memorable cards. Well anyway he got out Lars Farm first turn and Owen and Buru (fishy huh well I shuffled and cut his deck so I did a bad job ;p) Next turn I had the three sites out brought the 3 guys down to flip popped one on a AT-ST and moved one of the other guys to the forest so I had two guys there. His next turn he plopped down Ben along with his stick at his Hut, then moved him over. Seeing the oncoming barrage of Harvests I used the Ral Ops flip side to pull Secret Plans (this was the biggest mistake I made all game) so I deployed it started reinforcing my sites (except forest for some reason my second mistake) he next turn deployed Lando with gun to the farm and then Nabruned over to my forest (yeah this sucked I had IAO in my reserve when I got plans why didn't I get this first) he pegged off the two scrubs with the gun and saber I drew a 1 so he just revived beru or something I lost 8 force lost my IAO, Death Star and Dag Cave (there goes my activation) While I was able to hold him off for a half hour with my walkers scrubs, vader, mara and tarkin, my lock on the game was taken away as soon as he started playing funky cards like Dismantle on Sight and Demotion (ok Demotion isn't so funky but no one seems to play it) so my 4-Lom got popped and tarkin bit the big one and it all went downhill from there.

 Game 2 My TRM against Luke Mroz's Hunt Down Numbers
<br />
<br />
 Well I had an amazing opening hand well in terms of me getting things done Revo, Yoda's Hut a Nudj, EPP Leia, EPP luke ecc chewie and a wedge. So first turn brought down the nudj revoed the Meditation Chamber, searched for a Nudj and found nothing so he got to take a look at my deck so he was all happy, His next turn he plopped down a Holotable and two R1-G4s or whatever and put a 3720-1 in my deck. Next turn I deployed Wedge and ECC Chewie to the med chamber. He just activated for this turn (he had 9 in total now he was only activating 4 a turn) my turn I got hit by the # only lost 3, then I moved the two over to the holotheatre to drain left myself about 6 force. His turn he pays 8 deploys Vader, I Barriered him and prepared him for the beatdown. Next turn I deployed EPP Luke, Leia and a Melas and battled vader and the droids, popped off two of the droids and missed vader with the saber, I drew some sweet destiny, he had to forefit vader the last remaining droid and lose 10. after this the only cards of his to hit the table were Location x3 and a Defensive Fire or two, I plopped down a Savrip and POAS to his holotable, fought off another vader and drained him to death.

 Game 3 My TRM vs Dominic (the last name slips my mind) HDADTJ
<br />
<br />
 Well I had an average start, got Yoda's Hut in my starting hand, so I was getting some good activation at first, my hand was starting to get huge so I signaled for a Traffic Control, so my first punishment for that was a monnok used, then afterwards a Image of the Dark Lord on my middle site on Yavin (this was done 4th or 5th turn and essentially killed me) 3 force a turn until I got boushh out to block drains at the farm, but this game ended quickly nothing I could do. 
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
 At this point I essentially gave up so the decline well it explains himself.
<br />
<br />
 Game 4 My Ral Ops vs Brian Twiggs TRM
<br />
<br />
 Well this was probably one of my best games dispite me being stomped on, mostly because this game was just a blast to play, it was essentially a slugging match and well my DS deck didn't do too good of a job of slugging today, I was being drained for 4, for the last half of the game, but this was a fun slugfest, and Brian is a good guy.
<br />

<br />
 Game 5 My Ral Ops vs my Buddy Klepy's Alderaan Ops
<br />
<br />
 I had a good game flipped about second turn just my head wasn't in this game, I was pissed that I couldn't play in the YJ GS cause I'd of had to drop to play in it (I wasn't gonna drop I was losing but having a blast plus it was another 10 bucks) so I really lost all interest in this game and forgot completely about my ral ops and decree I had out so i was getting drained for too much (forgot about everything for some reason)
<br />
<br />
 FL I'm like at -80 something after this
<br />
<br />
 Game 6 my TRM vs some guy who's name escapes me
<br />
<br />
 Well I lost this too didn't really care anymore if I won or not I'd still get the same crap for prizes as everyone else.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 So in the end I scrubbed out after the 4 games and gave up for the last two, while I could of evened out and went 3-3, didn;t really matter to me anymore. But the real fun of the tournament was the post tournament stuff.
<br />
<br />
 Well The Final was between Alex Klamroth and Yannick Lapointe, Alex won in the end now to the good stuff.
<br />
<br />
 Well in attendance was a local store owner who was ragging on the Squadron Member the whole time about a buncha things,and well we all know he's a cranky POS who shouldn't be there (he even brought all of his SW product to the hall we played in and was selling em). He was BSing and lying to all the american players the whole time like to one guy he said he got the place for 350 and to another 450 and how he lost money, plus he was bashing D all the time being a cranky old man. 
<br />
<br />
 Well anyway here's the story Prize support was being given out a pack of WB hoth a jedi pack and 2 posters (yeah I hear all the ooooo ahhhhs out there) I got mine gave it all away to a local guy and well now the story begins, I was watching the final and they call Brian Twigg over for prize support he says 'You can keep the poster and jedi pack' and the store owner flipped out him insulting him swearing at him ect. Well Brian was confused by all this obviously like why the hell was getting yelled at so he apoligized but the store owner kept on yelling and bi^ching at him, yelling at the SM that he wanted his name so he could get him banned from tournaments (yeah ok there old man) then Brian just did the right thing and turned his back and walked over to a group of us, and Raphael told him something around the lines of 'don't worry about it this guy is a cheap old jerk' (ok well it may of been a little more wordy than that but my memory of what every single person said exactly is sketchy) then the store owner flips out at him saying you ungrateful ect ect you wouldn't get anything in montreal or anywhere else (yeah right we'd of got atleast triple almost anywhere else) then Maxim Briand started giving the guy what he deserved Raphael jumped in also yelling (you can get the exact words in Raph's report) then half the room joined in and well it ended with the SM Christian Lapointe breaking the whole thing up and the rest was just random comments and sorts towards him and well everyone left in disgust and that's all she wrote.

<br />
 Well Props
<br />
<br />
 All the people who showed up, sure I only talked to a few of them it was all fun and good.
<br />
<br />
 Well all in all it was well run nothing really wrong good work Chris
<br />
<br />
 The big yelling match at the end, I wish I had a video camera you could of sold that for maybe $5 a tape it was hilarious.
<br />
<br />
 The fact I actually won a game cause with the decks I was playing they can win a local but they can't touch people from other area's
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Slops
<br />
<br />
 My decks cause around here no one will playtest or help each other out, half the people hate each other which doesn't really help much and everyone is worried about people knowing their decks, when those people are the least of your worries.
<br />
<br />
 The Prize Support somewhat D's fault, but I'm sure we had leftovers of CC from the last tournament we had where was that? plus complete crap from the store owner WB hoth and jedi packs oh joy
<br />
<br />
 The store owner for just being there, like why was he there we were like a 15 minute drive from his store (which I guess is kinda far away) he wasn't really wanted there by anyone and he simply spent his time bi^ching and complaining and yelling at people
<br />
<br />

<br />
Quote of the day Clint Hays 'What the Hell is that??' this being said after i recieved my poutine from the snack bar (poutine being fries with gravy and cheese, although this one had shreaded cheese no curds, what's with that?)
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Well anyway hopefully I can actually manage to get the players around here actually up to par and maybe get them playtesting with eachother in time for the regional or else I'm screwed again with no one to point out the flaws in my deck.
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Maybe Next Time
