<p>Objective(1)
Mind What You Have Learned/Save You It Can â€˜</p>

<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>A quick run down</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jedi test #1 and #2 give you an edge in battles.
Your opponent needs to deploy that little bit more
ability to draw a battle destiny and no FD modifiers no more.</li>
  <li>Also the more characters the DS deploy the bigger
the chance for a good Noble Sacrifice.</li>
  <li>Slow down the early draining game with Battle Plan
and â€˜Wars Not Make One Greatâ€™.</li>
  <li>This deck concentrates on Space but is also capable
to battle on the surface (this due to high
Characters forfeit and Obi).</li>
  <li>
    <p>And donâ€™t forget, Yoda on his hut is also nice
during battle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>There are enough high destinies for your JT to
 succeed. You should be finished with them around
 turn 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>=&gt; As some of you might have noticed, on of the weaknesses
   of this deck is numbers. It those are played in your
   area just substitute the two alters for
   â€˜Donâ€™t Forget The Droidsâ€™.</p>
