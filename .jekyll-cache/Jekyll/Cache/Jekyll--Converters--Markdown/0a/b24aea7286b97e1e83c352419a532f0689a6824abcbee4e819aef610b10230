<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>Sorry for the late stratedy. need to take the lady to dinner.</p>

<p>Fist turn pull db and start the pod race. U have good destinies so dont worry.</p>

<p>Second turn pull db and deploy. wait for a beat down. Use your starting effects smart and clever.</p>

<p>This deck wins race ever time. It looks for a big beatdown every turn. Save force and drain at the docking bays with fallen portal. Try to get the goo nee tay out. It help massively. Its a 11-0 in tournament play so it rocks. U got everybody that shoots so that will help. Also late game, get figuring dan and use him. It helps massively. Use artoo combo with artoo i have a bad feeling. It takes the fight out of a person.</p>

<p>There is no problem against a dueling decks. It kills them in first deployment. Reason is, they accept u to lose for dueling which u will at first but a major beatdown will even things out really fast. Out of commision maul soon as possible try to get vader and battle for out of commision.</p>

<p>Death star 2 and space decks. drain them on ground and save your force for home one and falcon.</p>

<p>This is great deck. One of few ground decks i like. IT rocks with viable characters.</p>
