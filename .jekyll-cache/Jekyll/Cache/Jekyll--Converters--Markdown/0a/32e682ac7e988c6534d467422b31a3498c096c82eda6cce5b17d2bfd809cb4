I"É+<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After going 4-2 at my last tournament, following a streak of three 2-4 tourney&amp;#8217;s, I decided that I was finally ready to go to an out of town tourney. Me and my boyz, the MilfoNati Connection, left around 10:51 A.M. E.T. on Sat. morning for the hour drive to Schumers, for the 12 o clock tourney. I WAS STOKED!
<br />
<br />
My decks had proved well last week, and My dark so far is undefeated against games in which cheating was not involved. For dark I was playing a Podracing/Tat. Mains/Drain/Court deck. I have named this deck Mains On Scooters Vol. I. My Light is a Super HighTech, Top secret QMC deck I have coined QMC TechingGizMachine From HELL!!!. I was ready for action.
<br />
<br />
Well Here goes nothing&amp;#8230; My rating going in was 1578.
<br />
<br />
Round 1: Mains On Scooters Vol. I VS. Tyler Martins (1804) Pile HomoDeck.
<br />
<br />
Well we are both in the squad so whoever wins gets a victory and the loser has not lost to anyone out of the squad. I could not remember this game, so this was written by my friend Tyler Martin. Everytime it says I, it is referring to Tyler. Sorry about the mix up.
<br />
<br />
Well, I know Alexâ€™s deck and he knows mine, sort of.  I 
<br />
Slave Quarters, Battle Plan, YISYW, and Scrambeld 
<br />
Transmission.  He goes with Sebulbaâ€™s Pod and Wattoâ€™s Box.
<br />
In my opening hand I got Goo Ney Tay, two twixes, and some 
<br />
SAC.  So it was a pretty good start for me.  First turn we
<br />
race, he draws a 3, deploys a docking bay, and draws up.  My
<br />
turn I deploy Goo Ney Tay and my twixes.  I get Shimi and 
<br />
naked Threepio.  I use him and get another twix.  He only 
<br />
gets seven or eight, so he canâ€™t do much.  We race and he 
<br />
gets a 3.  He saves up some and draws some.  My turn I use
<br />
Threepio and get Shocking.  I draw up some to get more 
<br />
twixes. He races and gets a two.   His turn he deploys Maul
<br />
to the Audience Chamber for 8 and lets me go.  My turn I 
<br />
activate about 20 and deploy Qui-Gon, Han, and Leia. I also
<br />
deploy Draw Their Fire.  He barriers Qui-Gon, but I Sense 
<br />
it.  So we battle, I retrieve 2(he deployed First Strike) 
<br />
and he loses 2.  I fire with the lightsaber, miss, and draw
<br />
two threes.  He draws a one.  So I lose Han and he loses 
<br />
Maul and two more.  His turn he tries to deploy Vader and 
<br />
Tarkin, but he doesnâ€™t have enough because of Goo Nee Tay.
<br />
Instead he deploys Tempest 1 and Igar to the docking bay.  
<br />
My turn, I Nabrun over Qui-Gon and Leia.  I deploy my other
<br />
Han, Bacta Tank, and battle.  I have a power 20 to his 13
<br />
I dunk Han and he loses Igar and one more.  Next turn he 
<br />
comes down with Vader, and saber.  Battles, hits Leia and I
<br />
hit him.  I lose her and a couple more.  I clear the site.
<br />
My turn I drain, deploy a monk to the quarters.  I draw a
<br />
couple and save a bunch.  Next turn he wins the podrace and
<br />
retrieves.  I It Could Be Worse all 11.  He deploys Maul and
<br />
Mara, he had force because he saved.  My turn, Luke comes
<br />
down, Han gets out of the tank, and Lando comes down.  I 
<br />
battle, exclude Mara, with a tracked 5.  I also hit Maul.  I
<br />
draw a 4, 2, and 4.  He loses Maul and a couple more.  A 
<br />
couple more turns of drains do him in.
<br />

<br />
Well I blew my first game, Dang u Alex George. Atleast my dark is still Somewhat Undefeated, but I don&amp;#8217;t want to mention why. 
<br />
<br />
Round 2: QMC TechingGizMachine From HELL!!! VS. AJ Kleins (1542) I&amp;#8217;m Sorry Three.
<br />
<br />
He is another player in the connection, so I am rather Poed. Well I also have played this deck, and lost too it both times before this. Lets see if I can change my streak. Well he goes first, and Miraculously gets a first turn DARK DEAL. Alright, Im screwed. I draw and then he goes. Lose 9. FU*K!!!!. my turn. I deploy Luke and Obi, AND TRIPLER BATTLE. Clash a trooper, hit the other one, Gift of the Mentor, Draw 3 destiny my 17 to his 7. Dang Dark deal and Bespin cloud city. He loses the trooper and 20!!!. I then move to his other site. His turn, forcedrains me for 8. DANG!!!. My turn battle, kill that site, but im 4 sites away from his other site that he controls. Drain for 2. He drains for 8. By the time I am one site away from him, I am dead. Another 7 turn game, Dangit. Lose by 4.
<br />
FL 0 (-14)
<br />
<br />
Well, well, well. What a game. It was down to the wire, but dark deal proved too much for my high tech deck. I guess I will have to win my next 4 games If I want any chance at the Tourney.
<br />
<br />
SUBWAY TIME!!!!. I order a 12 inch pizza sub from the rather ugly lady. I then go over and try to flirt with a girl in the restaurant. O SHIIT. HER BOYFRIEND SHOWS UP. I am a complete MORON!!!. O well. I get a good sub. YUM :-)
<br />
<br />
Round 3: Mains On Scooters Vol. I VS. Adam Reidys (1440) Endor Light.
<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHA!!!. My dark is going to demolish this podrace. He starts, careful planning, Rebel landing site and Forest, and I start wattos box. First turn Mara with saber, from my hand, he goes. Does not do anything, loses 1 from my objective, draws, my turn. Force drain for 2 at audience chamber, deploy DS2 Docking bay. Get out Maul and saber. I am set for the game. He deploys Gen. Solo, and Chewie of Kashyyk. Loses 1, I go. I deploy IGGY with gun, battle, capture Han, draw a 5, he loses chewie. His turn. He deploys, Obi with saber, Light Prof., Book, and I go he loses 1. I sit and forcedrain at chamber. Win the race. Retrieve 6 by emptying my hand with podrace collision, and he loses 11. He goes. Does not forcedrain, deploys Quigon and saber at forest, WHY NOT TATOOINE!!!, I go he loses 1. I deploy Darth Vader with saber to chamber, to complete my drain of 4. What a Ephing Biatch. His turn. Does not force drain at Iggys site, and moves over. I follow with Iggy, and he does not forcedrain me for the rest of the game. I have drawn way to many and by the time I finish I win by 25. Great game Alex George.
<br />
FW 2 (11)
<br />
Props: Podracing, Court, Iggy with captured Han.
<br />
Slops: 18 card hand. Being too cool for myself.
<br />
<br />
Well I win a rather simple game, because I guess he thinks Iggy cancels force drains. WTF!. 
<br />
<br />
Round 4: QMC TechingGizMachine From HELL!!! VS. Adam Reidys (1440) Podracing, no objective, palace.
<br />
<br />
I decide I do not want to do my monster tech this game, and instead just set up on Cloud city with my mains. I deploy them, flip my objective with Wedge in ship, by third turn. WOOHOO. I start looking for cards in my force pile to assure my presence on Cloud city. Deploy outrider and dash. While all this is going down he is sitting in Jabbas palace with 3 sabers. I play Menace fades to shut the funker up. He then decides he wants to be Reeeeeeeeal tricky and elis helrots all his characters up to cloud city. He battles Leia and Lando. Hits lando and operates, hes a dead duck, Path leia away now (hehehehe) and battle is canceled. He then moves them over to the middle site, with Leia, luke, and Obi. My turn. I deploy Celebration, Find I know move my Han and Tawws khaa over and NOW WE ARE READY TO RUMBBBBBLLLLLLLE. He battles, I clash Dr e. He hits only one character with 3 sabers. I hit Mara, Maul, and miss Vader. Dangit Lando. Destiny adders, I end up winning the battle by 25. He loses Vader and 17 more, he drew a 0 for destiny so Luke, Leia, Han, and Tawws stay. YAY!!!. I move around. Force drain, WIN THE PODRACE. Empty lost pile with that and celebrating. Win the game by 32.
<br />
FW 4 (43)
<br />
Props: Destiny adders. Celebration.
<br />
Slops: his gayness of elising and killing so that I could path away from action. Well I win.
<br />
<br />
What a marvelous game by the one alex george. I love retrieving everything. Well so far so good.
<br />
<br />
Round 5: Mains On Scooters Vol. I VS. Josh Rohrigs (1702) Light QMC podracing Mains.
<br />
<br />
Well I feel a little down on having to play a podracing deck, cause I do not know how my deck will fare against it. I get a first turn Mara with saber again, and it is his turn. He just draws and loses 1. PODRACE UPDATE. My 5 versus his 6 and I get no destiny this turn. HE DRAWS 2 0s. hahaha. Great. The rest of the game was a blur. There was not one battle. I get out the 3 saber carriers with sabers at the chamber, he flips his objective and runs off of tatooine. Loses 1 every turn. Drains for 3 while I drain for 4 and 2 in space. He has no space after I beat him down so he pays for battle plan. The podrace never ends, because of 5 Podrace collisions, and 3 a step backwards. What a gip. I finally do drain him out though, on the same turn that If I would have waited, he would have wont he race. I win this very very very very very oober very close game by 6. I would have lost if he could have canceled my drains. O well what a game.
<br />
FW 6 (49)
<br />
Props: Podrace coll. And A step backwards for being killer, killer cards.
<br />
Slops: Podrace coll. And A step backwards for being killer, killer cards.
<br />
<br />
Well there we go, my dark is 2-1 (ahem) again. Time for my light to skool some unsuspecting person
<br />
<br />
Round 6: QMC TechingGizMachine From HELL!!! VS. Darren Combss (1493) Weird Dark Deck, that does nothing.
<br />
<br />
Well this is a game, that made no sense to me. Lets skip to about the third turn, cause nothing really happened. He has blizzard 1 and Blizzard 2 on a Cloud city exterior site of his. I deploy Han, leia, luke and obi. No tripler, battle, 8 destiny, he loses everything and 25. I then proceed to spread out with celebration on table and my obj flipped. He loses about everything, but I end up emptying my lost pile. This game took approximately 6 turns. I win by 38.
<br />
FW 8 (87)
<br />
Props: Destiny, and Celebrate
<br />
Slops: demolition over a scrubby man.
<br />
<br />
Well that game is over and I am pretty stoked cause I know I got third place.
