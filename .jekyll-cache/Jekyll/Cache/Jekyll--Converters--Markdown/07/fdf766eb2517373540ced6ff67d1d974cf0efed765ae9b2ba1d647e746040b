I"W<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Searching the Internet for tournaments, I has the luck to find a SE Sealed deck tournament. These are my comments on the SE SD tournaments that occurred at 12:30 pm on Sun, October 15, 2000 at The Splash Page in Missoula.
<br />
<br />
Well, the tournament had a lot of new people. It is the first tournament that I have attended here in Missoula and for many players in their first Sealed Tournament. After delaying for close to half an hour, we got our eight people, which is exceptional for Montana and for a place without an established base. I apologize for not knowing my opponents names, but if they start going to tournaments on a regular basis then I will surely learn them and use them for reference.
<br />
<br />
Having decided to play LS, we got our choice this tournament, I proceeded to open my SE Starter and find the rares. I happen to get the one objective that actually works in this format. Very cool. So, I decide to run it, even if I cannot flip. I then remove all the cards that are not playable, and get rid of some locations so I don’t draw zeros. Actually, I had really good destiny this tournament, which is cool. If you want to look at my choices, they are below, otherwise skip to read about my games.

So, I have a pretty solid deck with a lot of ability two guys and a pair of matching pilots. That should make it easy to do well, since destiny should not be too hard a problem. 
<br />
<br />
Game One: 
<br />
My opponent reveals that he has the Death Star Assault Squad. Ouch. However, I try not to fear this too much. The usual action consists of my B-Wing coming down and draining until one of the fixed DS ships shows up and makes it’s life miserable once its brother gets there. Fortunately, by the time he got the DS AS out, I had a matching guy with ship, so I had ridiculous power of ten, because B-Wing was alive, and  Guy with Ship had a friend piloting. He had to lose the DS AS to attrition. Nothing on ground really bothered me, because DS has a hard time finding four ability. I win by 16
<br />
<br />
Game Two:
<br />
Pretty much the same running around in space. Ground battle consisted of me putting two pilots in Patrol Craft and reacting around, with thinly spread forces. He couldn’t get destiny but had power. Win by 18
<br />
<br />
Game Three: Same as before, this time with different guys in Patrol Craft. He gave me CC: Port Town Dist. and Casino to drain at. I didn’t worry about Bothawui and sites because he wasn’t challenging. Win by high teens
<br />
<br />
Game Four: Main event was when he tried to lay down smack on my guys, only to draw a site to my six. Kept battling Guy in Gold 4, I kept drawing high enough destiny to get battle damage, but no attrition. I had 4+Destiny to his 6. Kept drawing two or greater. The big play was when I got the six, causing massive forfeiture of his jabroni unmatching operatives. Won by high teens.
<br />
<br />
Well, I went undefeated but so did every other LS jabroni. Since my differential sucked, as it always does, I took last amongst the LS players. However, most of the vets played LS this tournament, so that is not exactly a telling sign. I hate differential, it sucks. However, this was fun and I learned that Patrol Craft are cool even if they have no power and the driver hops out to help with the battle. Great fun reacting those suckers over to my spread out sites.
<br />
<br />
Overall, I would rate the tournament as a success, because sanctioned tournaments are a rare breed in Montana. It was nice to get the first tournament this season in our area sanctioned and I look forward to writing lots of tournament reports from this area.

PS, sorry about taking over a week to post, but I have been extremely busy.
