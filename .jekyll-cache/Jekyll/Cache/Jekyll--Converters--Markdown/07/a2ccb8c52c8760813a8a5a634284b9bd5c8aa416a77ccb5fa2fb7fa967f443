<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>This is almost the same deck/strategy as last time.  I still can’t think of much that can beat this thing.</p>

<p>This is the start</p>

<p>Hunt Down
Epic Duel
Executor Meditation Chamber
Executor Holotheatre
Visage
Prepared Defenses
Imperial Arrest Order
Mobilization Points</p>
<ul>
  <li>one effect depending on what opponent is playing.</li>
</ul>

<p>=================================
UPDATE
=================================</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sense isn’t a problem. I grab it and play Alter. Sim will make it hard for you to get a low enough draw.</li>
  <li>Honor isn’t a problem. I activate about 10-14 force second turn usually, plenty to spread to 3 BGs 3rd or fourth turn.</li>
  <li>If you are going to give this deck less than a 5, tell me why. Don’t say ”good deck” and give it a 4. Why isn’t this deck worlds caliber?  <em>cough</em>LORDNIKON<em>cough</em></li>
  <li>Yes this deck can beat a good HB deck.  I have done it many a time, with out using anything but Search and Destroy, Visage, and space drains.  As a matter of fact, earlier today I beat it by 17, then 22, then 28.	I am pretty confident I have the game in the bag vs. Hidden Base.</li>
</ul>

<p>=================================
END UPDATE
=================================</p>

<p>vs. EBO  Start Resistance. Imperial Decree does jack in this deck. Resistance is better. You get out Search and Destroy and you sit there at your docking bays and Rendili and smack em for 6 a turn, while taking only 2. If they come for you, you beat the hell out of them. Use your high destiny and so forth to make sure you smash them in any battle or duel. Some people say that EBO beats Hunt Down, but I have beat 3-4 of them already, I’d assume not.</p>

<p>vs. Hidden Base  Start Battle Plan. Get Executor Dbay first turn instead of a battleground one. Flip, pop out Search and Destroy and watch their life force dwindle away. If they come down with Obi or Luke, duel em.</p>

<p>vs. Throne Room  This is a dying deck, but start Crush. This makes it so that you almost can not be beatdown. No Clash and no more than 2 battle destiny. if Obi or Luke shows up use Janus and Sim to rig some destinies and duel them away. The last time I played against a Throne Room with this deck I won by 32 cards.</p>

<p>vs. Profit  This is a dying deck too, but this is kind of a hard matchup. I’d start Crush the Rebellion with Mara and Evazan in the chamber. Mara won’t get Clashed and then you can smack and operate on anybody. Try and duel Obi and just smack Luke around. Usually if you win one duel you will win the game.</p>

<p>vs. Anything else  use your brain and adapt to their game. If they are non interactive set up Search and Destroy. If they are then duel them and beat em up.</p>

<p>Some card choices</p>

<p>Executor DBay - just in case I need to get to the Executor to stop a drain or setup Visage if they have a character there.</p>

<p>Sim Aloo and Janus - these guys are awesome in dueling. I set up your destiny and make sure I get 2 6s.</p>

<p>CC and DS DBays are mobile sites, so no Projection of a Skywalker or Lost in the Wilderness. I stole this idea from Brian Hunter. I stole it fair and square, too.</p>

<p>More strategy</p>

<ul>
  <li>Korea by the Deftones is a good song.</li>
  <li>Sleep is good.</li>
  <li>Around the Fur is a better song. ‘</li>
</ul>
