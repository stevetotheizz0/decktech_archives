I"[<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I woke up at around 12, and proceeded to get ready for running a tournament at the local card store. I got ready and proceeded to walk on down to the store, and got there a good 10 minutes early. Since the store was RIGHT next to the University of Tennessee, the players are ALWAYS late. Its a Sunday tourney, what can I say?
<br />
So, I find two players there playing their decks. Wow! 2 before the time we were SUPPOSED to start! Yeah!
<br />
Eventually a full hour and 20 minutes after the 1:00 starting time, we have enough to start. EJP Objectives were seen, as were Mara and her saber, Master Luke and Zuckuss in Mist Hunter. Also, Reflections was much traded and purchased. Lots of foils everywhere. Here is a list complete with rankings:
<br />

<br />
1st Game
<br />
-Jason's Huntdown deck went against Rob's Jawa deck. Im sure most of you are thinking, well, THIS would be a blowout.. but it wasn't. Jason's was a dueler, and there is no Jedi Jawa as yet, so no luck there. Also, a well placed Sandwhirl made several of his Imperials missing. Ouch. In the end, Jason pulled it out with a 10 point win.
<br />
-Craig's CPI deck played against Michael's Dantooine Base deck. Michael got the early jump by getting his nudj's out and then flipping the Objective.  A few turns later, things turned ugly, as Dantooine was actually blown away by the Death Star! Foil CPI and everything. This made Micheal, who had a limited bit of space on table, in a total lockdown, with only 2 force per turn. It was up to Craig to just whittel away and that was it. Criag by 17
<br />
-Matt and Joseph played, in which Joseph's ISB agents were met with doom on Cloud City. Matt won by 34. After this game, both dropped to go watch the Titan's game. Oh well...
<br />
-Thomas's ISB deck spreaded out quickly and drained at all of the docking bays before Tyler could flip the operative objective. Once he did it was too alte. RA-7 was giving Tyler next to noting in drains. Thomas won by 20
<br />
<br />
2nd Game
<br />
-Jason's Light Side Objective deck goes against Tyler's Dark Objective deck. On paper this looks bad for the Light Side, but Jason is a very talented player, and Tyler is really just a beginner. Long story short, Jason get a free Master Luke, and a Ben Kenobi opening draw. Frees Han and thats about it. Jason by 19
<br />
-Craig's asteroids are got the jump on Michael's ISB, but the Outer Rim Scouts game text and numerous starships in Michael's deck stop the sanctuaries. Michael by 7.
<br />
-Thomas's Hidden Base deck made quick and easy work of Rob's Bounty deck. The lack of the EJP objective and draining sealed his fate. Thomas by 31. After this game, Rob leaves for work... we now have a whopping 5 people! Wow!
<br />
<br />
3rd Game
<br />
-Jason's Light Objective flipped automatically when Master Luke dropped, b/c Michael didn't play any aliens. Jason then spread out and it battled what little Michael had to deploy. Jason won by 22
<br />
-Thomas's Hidden Base deck made easy work of Craig's CPI deck, by simply draining quickly, and not being effected by a lockdown that the deck needs to win. Thomas by 5.
<br />
<br />
4th Game
<br />
-Jason's Huntdown beat Tyler's Operative deck, when Vader and Company smacked the 0peratives site after site.
<br />
-Craig's Asteroids were just too quick for Thomas's ISB drop and drain in docking bays. The sanctuaries ate him up. Craig won by 5.
<br />
<br />
In the end Jason won with a 8(+70)
<br />
Thomas, after returning from a four month vacation, got 2nd with 6(+51).
<br />
the rest of the 5 that stayed placed as follows:
<br />
Craig Byrd 4(+10)
<br />
Michael Crosby 4 (-32)
<br />
Tyler Crosby 4 (-39)
<br />
<br />
All in all, not TOO bad a tourney.. just wish people would stay to play the whole thing!
