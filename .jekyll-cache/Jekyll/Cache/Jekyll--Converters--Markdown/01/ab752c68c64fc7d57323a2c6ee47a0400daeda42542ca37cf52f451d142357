<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>First Iâ€™ll arm the death star with a superlaser. then all get as many sites out as I can. Then Iâ€™ll put a leader in the conference room, and Iâ€™ll deploy all my gunners to make sure I blow up Alderaan. Iâ€™ll also deploy other characters as they come through my hand to help defend the death star sites. Iâ€™ll deploy my patrol droid, im4-099, and battle against force drains. After I blow up alderaan Iâ€™ll flip my objective and start deploying battle ground systems. Then Iâ€™ll deploy all my star desroyers and my starships. If unpiloted I will add r4-m9 to pilot the ship.Then I will force drain my opponent to death, but just before theyâ€™er dead Iâ€™ll make an attempt to blow up yavin 4 (just for fun). â€˜</p>
