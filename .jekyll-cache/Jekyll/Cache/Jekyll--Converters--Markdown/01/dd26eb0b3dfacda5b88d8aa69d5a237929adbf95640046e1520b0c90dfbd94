<p>Update</p>

<p>No one plays GRIMTASHH in my area and the few times they did they didnt get anything so if GRIMTASH is big in your area change a couple cards but dont tell me to worry bout GRIMTASHH cuz no one plays it against me.</p>

<p>Ive been playing this deck pretty much since day three of worlds. This is the best version of hunt down high destiny dueling. It plays with 10 sevens so you can choke capture and blind duel the opponent to death.</p>

<p>Always go for the first turn flip if they know the deck they wont come after vader that early on and if they dont well you can take care of them. The 3 maras are for a quik invasion of the oponnents docking bays. Im not sure what the meta in other regions but we get a lot of new age throne room around here. That and i use her a lot to do blind duels against Luke just incase for some reason i should loose i still have vader.</p>

<p>The space fleet is a bit skimpy but the whole game plan when it comes to dedicated space decks is to wipe out there site with the high destinies. stick 4lom and iggy on zuckuss and youve got a mean ship especially when your drawing sevens for your destiny. You can easily hold a system while chasing the opponent around space.</p>

<p>Visage never gets cancelled or atleast for that long since i play 8. Yes it isnt too smart to have them when it comes to grimtashh but no one plays that around here and you would be surprised how quikly i start to cycle the sevens back into the deck using either reactor terminal or janus.</p>

<p>You pretty much play the deck the same every game you set up drains and wait for the opponent to engage you. If they dont come after you then just drain t hem and use search and destroy to hurt the space and cheese decks. As soon as they engage you then you either duel them or beat them up by choking or capturing.</p>

<p>When it comes to dueling if your afraid to blind duel then dont play the deck. I blind dueled JK luke with lightsaber on the third turn of the game with focused attack and won by 3. From there on out i had won. Late game you want to non epic vaders obsession so you can retrieve a @#$% load of force.</p>

<p>The deck seems all balls but it wins and when it wins it wins big. Ive one games with this deck by as much as 44 and it consistly wins by a lot. It has lost maybe 3 games since ive been playing this version. It lost to Brian twiggs palace raider decks cuz at the time i had no retrieval protection and i couldnt do jack against his harvest except sit there and jerk off. It truly is a great deck yet it is hard to play.   â€˜</p>
