I"¥<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is my first tourney report
<br />
I got to the local card store at 12:00, the tourney started at 2 and was 4 game, I figured i would play test my teched out deck of WYS against tournament director James leiser,s cloud city occupation deck, it seemed to do pretty good, considering it was the only deck i had made that had the potential to beat that deck. After playing it a couple of times i decided i would play it and I had to trade some cards for that i was short for the deck like dash, or OOCTTâ€™s. at about 1:30 all the hard core players started to come like scott mccelland, and jeremy kauffman, we talked for a bit till the rest of the players got thier. we started the tourney a little after 2 with 14 players. heres how it went.
<br />
<br />
First game- me LS vs. barret ???? DS (i didnâ€™t catch his last name)
<br />
      It was my brand new WYS deck vs his BHBM deck. He started out as normal by pulling the emperor at the DSII DB, and pulling rendilli, then he picked up the rest, I pulled my &lt;&gt; DB, flipped first turn with a palace raider and ECC lando. Next turn he put ECC vader and tarkin against lando. he battled, i shot tarkin but he canceled the destiny, i played slight weapons malf. and solohan. i drew 2 3â€™s killed tarkin and lost lando as forfeit.
<br />
later i got rebel scout luke out of the deck, got vader out of there and spread over the 3 tatoiine sights. (i had a palace raider on a partrol craft and 2 diffrent battle destiny adders in my hand so every one was quite safe plus he wasâ€™nt activating that much any more.)
<br />
I eventually set up tatooine celebration up and had tatooine dominated. he couldnâ€™t find any more characters but i lost 3 for a couple duels but eventually i drained him out.
<br />
END RESULT- me/win by 23       +23/ 2 VP
<br />
<br />
2nd game- me DS vs rory diabler LS
<br />
Rory is a local player that was only playing to make it an even 14 players. I played my huntdown against his RTP deck. 
<br />
first time i drop vader in the yavin DB, pull rendilli, and the endor DB, then i move vader in the warroom. this was basically a beating for him, i drained him of about half his deck before he finally fliped, but by then it was too late, he really couldnâ€™t do anything about search and destroy, visage and drain of 6. for about 6-7 turns. i eventually drained him out and won by 20 cards.
<br />
<br />
END RESULT me/ win by 20       +43/ 4 VP
<br />
<br />
3rd game  me LS vs Scott MCcelland
<br />
This was probably the most exciting game today, my WYS deck vs scotts my kind of scum deck thats not scum but uses myo as the rep. I was nervous about this game because scum was one of the 2 decks that i have trouble against.I started usually by flipping first turn with 2 scrubs at both DBâ€™s, because i pulled a fallen portal in my hand, he just pulled the sail barge then the sight and fortified the audiance chamber, i started draing for 2 then i ploped down a palace raider and a patrol craft down at one of the DBs then i moved a RFC and a EPP han in to the cantina. he responds with e EPP fett(which i barriered) guri, and some other mofoâ€™s the beat me down he retrieves he looses some scrub, i loose both guys. for a few turns it was nothing but drains, then i finaly try to raid the mofoâ€™s out of the cantina with talon cardde, EPP han, and EPP luke. he barriers luke and i grab it, but i have to sit the guys in thier for him to battle and retrieve. I screwed over guri by drawing 1 then smokescreening the other to ovweride guriâ€™s text saying may NOT DRAW MORE THAN ONE. I wiped out the cantina and had set up celebration, with the new admirals order out so i could move during my control phase to retrieve and drain more. thier were a few other battles but my attrition ended up killing him in the end. he had to pick up with only about 8 cards left to prevent me from retrieving around 6 a turn. 
<br />
END RESULT me/win by 20     +63/ 6 VP     ]
<br />
<br />
4th game me vs james  ????  (i donâ€™t know his last name, he is some guy from massachusetts.
<br />
<br />
I played my huntdown deck from his WYS kessel run deck. i had fun with this one since it was a different player to play against besides the players that go to the shop regularly. I drew my hand and got all my DBâ€™s and rendilli in my hand and no vader, so i just drew it all up and got lord vader and his stick. during his turn he put down jedi luke at the home one DB and left him thier ???. I put vader and his stick down at the endor DB and sat thier about 3 turns letting visage do its work, i also sat palpy in the cantina and dr. e./ponda baba at the DSI db., eventually he stated draining at kessel, so i put zuckuss and a pilot, with bossk at rendilli. he had no ability so i won tha battle, eventually he did a kessel run with leebo, but secret plans prevented him from retrieving. he brought down melas, RFC, and jedi luke against palpy, i played I have you now, with a tracked 5, 5, 6, and he lost the sight, palpy got hit so he died too. I still had a drain of 5 left and search and destroy finished him off.
<br />
END RESULT me/win by 16     79/8 vp
<br />
<br />
 I ended up winning the tournament, and a foil luke skywalker. Iâ€™m stlii waiting for deciphers employees to send me prize support, but who knows decipher is nothing but incompitance. James leiser i hear he just got his PA 2nd place prize support from decipher. (it only took a year.)
