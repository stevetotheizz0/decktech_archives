<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>The startegy is simple, start with Bad Feeling Have I, for most everything, Special Precautions for Hidden Base, and Secret Plans for Profit(as if you all didn’t already know this). Get the force generation sites out fast and flip A.S.A.P.  I wish I had more to say, but it’s fairly simple, not unlike othe Ralltiir Ops decka, just my little spin on it.</p>
