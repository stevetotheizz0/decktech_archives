<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>I won’t waste anyone’s time explaining how it works-you should all know by now anyway.  I will explain a few card choices that you may not understand</p>

<p>A step Backward-why would I play this and not use Anakin’s?  Check the CRD-If the DS podraces, I can use this to remove their race destiny while not removing the one that I stack on the site-also they can’t play hit racer or podracer collision.  Also, the card does have another use but it’s very rarely used that way.</p>

<p>As good as gone-what does this card do?  Oh yeah, it gets around the Responsibility/Much anger combo.  DS doesn’t like using it on Han or Luke because you can edge them, so they will go for Lando, wedge, or theron nett.  Use this to take them back to your hand-the combo is broken-and you can redeploy next turn.  Much quicker than using the hoth db.</p>

<p>It’s a hit- the card is so good.  Not only does it cancel about 5 good DS cards, but it can also a force drain over and over again.  PLay it, then track with Mirax or Threepio and who cares if they are sitting with Maul or Vader in your Cantina.</p>

<p>I don’t think I need to explain anything else.  The deck is a beast-it can and has beat anything out there.  No this is not Clint Hays’ deck(it wasn’t really Clint’s either) ‘</p>
