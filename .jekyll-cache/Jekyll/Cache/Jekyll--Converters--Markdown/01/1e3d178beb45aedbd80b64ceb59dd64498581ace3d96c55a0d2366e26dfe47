<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>You grab your sites and BCC first turn. next turn drop bespin. drop a lone vader and his lightsaber(or without it) if they battle him vader’s eye and i have you now(if you have the lightsaber on him then use you are beaten) if it’s darth vader he adds one to your destinies so you kill everybody.(really high destiny) once someone dropped a luke w/ stick and battled me. i have you nowed and hit him. i drew a 6, 6, and a 3. they are all +1 and luke was hit. he drew a 5 and vader died and luke died with 14 overflow.(that was second turn, i might add.) Mara by herself can also use vaders eye to add a destiny</p>

<p>The QMC YISYW+Launching The Assault+Home One combo is popular so i drop dengar and bossk and fett and some forfeit fodder and chunk it. boom. no more celebration.</p>

<p>i have some ghhhks in here in case they limit my destinies and kill me.</p>

<p>i have this is some rescues in here to stop out of commissions which would hurt my vader combo severely. they also have a huge destiny.</p>

<p>I have levitation attacks and those high destiny devices to raise my power in battle and i could get them for my destiny draws(and i usually do)</p>

<p>i don’t have dark deal in here for a reason. all the stuff to pull it off would hurt my destiny(which is the point of this deck) and QMC is popular so i probobly couldn’t pull it off without it getting canceled.</p>

<p>decks like QMC generals that limit my destiny draws OWN decks like these but they aren’t popular in my area.</p>
