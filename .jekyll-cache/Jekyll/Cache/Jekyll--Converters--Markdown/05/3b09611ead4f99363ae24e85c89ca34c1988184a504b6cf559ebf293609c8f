<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>This is probably one of only a few Dark Deal decks that doesnâ€™t use Sabacc manip.	The key to this deck is Port Town District.  Start that w/ Expand the Empire on it for awesome alien bonuses and force drain bonuses all over Cloud City.</p>

<p>The musicians are just awesome. Lyn Me can usually subtract 4 or 5 from your opponents power, Umpass-Stay makes them all huge power.  Rappertunie can make a character power 0 and w/ Rystall you even retrieve when you deploy them.  I like to deploy them in a group and Elis Helrot them around for a musician beatdown.  Spread out and drain w/ everyone else, you can make them lose 15 or more a turn w/ Dark Deal and Cloud City Occupation.  The Sacrifices work well against Enhanced characters or when you havenâ€™t got a Ghhk or something else.	The combat cloud cars are enough to hold Cloud City, and there is definitely enough ships to hold Bespin or keep them away from Coruscant if they have it.</p>

<p>Against EBO Drain wars, draw a lot in the beginning and set up fast.</p>

<p>Against Profit Start Ak-Rev and Rystall at the AC, then go for musician madnessYou can have Umpass-Stay and Lyn Me there by turn 3 and they will have a very hard time beating you in battles.</p>

<p>Against Mains Take your time. make sure you keep a Ghhk or Sacrifice or Elis Helrot in your hand.  Wait until you have plenty of guys to set up Dark Deal, then drain to death.</p>

<p>Against Ops practically same as EBO
