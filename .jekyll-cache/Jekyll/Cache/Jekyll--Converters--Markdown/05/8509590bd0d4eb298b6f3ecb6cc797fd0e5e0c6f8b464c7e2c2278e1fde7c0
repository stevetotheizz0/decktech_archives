I"Ì<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is going to be short and sweet, as I don't know how the hell you people can remember every itty bitty thing that went on in a game! I'll do the best I can, but try not to be too harsh...
<br />
<br />
I came to Ottawa from Montreal, with Eric Paquin as my sole passenger. My other buddies had dropped out, leaving me in despair, but I was undetered nonetheless. This includes Farzin Zakikhani, who is an excellent underrated player in the Hoth: Ice Plains region. 
<br />
<br />
As I got there, I met up with other quebecers (I think we were around 11 in total), including Yannick Lapointe and Raphael Asselin. I knew that there were some strong Americans who had made a road trip of going to Grand Slams, so I was hoping for a really heated tournament. Ha, I tried to strike up a quick convo with Clint Hayes, but it seemed like he snubbed me (?), no insult intended. Jonathan Chu though was very cool, as were Steve Brentson, who's bad luck plagued him the whole way.
<br />
<br />
If you'd like to see the decks I played, they're both titled Ottawa GS decks...I took a Profit and HD.
<br />
<br />
GAME 1: Matt Mitchell, Hunt Down
<br />
<br />
From what I've known, Matt used to be a good player. Recently though, according to him, he's been in a downward spiral, so I didn't really know what to expect. He deployed many characters 4 ability characters at his own Tatooine sites early on(Jundland, Moisture farm). Unfortunately, Vader failed to make a showing till mid-game, and since Han had been rescued since turn 2, his pile was shrinking by 4 a turn. It's unfortunate I couldn't deal any significant battle damage, as Visage was draining my (and his) force pile away. I eventually did win through 'attrition', ending up with a +17.
<br />
<br />
FW 2 (+17)
<br />
<br />
Highs: He's a great guy, and happened to be the only other smoker there!!
<br />
Lows: I was really hungry (breakfast was a no show)
<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME 2: Dominic Gaudreault, Throne Room Mains + NeverTellMTO
<br />
<br />
This was a game that had to be played. Dominic and I have only played a few games, but each time I've only narrowly beat him. I think he really wanted to win, because to some, i'm an overrated player. Well, he was getting his chance. 
<br />
We both drew first turn, 2nd turn I deployed Vader to a BG and flipped the Obj. Nothing much on his side, but he does save some force. On the 3rd turn, I deploy Endor and the tyrant, thinking that he can't do much with only 12 force, plus I have imperial barrier. On his turn, comes the falcon with luke at the head. I play IB, and he plays skywalkers, sucks for me. He then uses his last force to initiate battle... but, among some other mistakes fails to realize that skywalkers can't initiate combat. Ouch. Newayz, on my turn comes the avenger with ozzel/evax, and i proceed to apply beat down to the poor falcon. Visage stayed the whole game and eventually  dwindled away at his force pile. The game was still close near the end, but he was beat by 14. It's unfortunate I don't have reactor terminal in my deck, as my hand size was very big.
<br />
<br />
FW 4 (+31)
<br />
<br />
Highlights: He may be @#$%y, but he's a softie at heart (according to an ex-girlfriend, so I hear...) 
<br />
Lows: I'm still hungry
<br />
<br />
GAME 3: Jonathan Marchi, Throne Room Mains
<br />
<br />
This game was not exactly a clincher, but there wasn't much Joe could do. I knew that he had beat Steve Brentson (2100 or something) in his first game, so I was a little nervous as to what my opponent was playing. Anyways, the game ended up in the bag by turn 5, and he was left will little to do.
<br />
In this game as well, my opponent made the mistake of deploying Leia with my objective being flipped, and this he was punished for. When will people realize ?? :) I eventually grounded out a win by +23.
<br />
<br />
FW 6 (+54)
<br />
<br />
Highlights: I'm not hungry any more.
<br />
Lows: That sinking feeling in your stomach when you climb the tournament ladder. (it only gets harder from here...)
<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME 4: Eric Paquin, Hunt Down w/Cloud City Sabacc
<br />
<br />
My poor friend had to play me, his ride. I tried to threaten him but he refused to lose... damn. Newayz this game got ugly, and ugly did it get. On my turn 3, Eric had just realized that he didn't place any aliens at the Chamber, and he got, to say the least, upset. I freed Han, nabruned over to Lando, destroyed Lando with Luke, Leia, Chewie and Han. He demanded a rematch because of his gross error at the start, but I couldn't. You have to be fair, but this wasn't my fault in any way. You learn the most through your mistakes. Ended up with +20.
<br />
<br />
FW 8 (+74)
<br />
<br />
Highlights: I won
<br />
Lows: He's in the same car, and he's 6'5'.(we made amends, phew)
<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME 5: Yannick Lapointe, HB with Alderaan retrieval engine
<br />
<br />
Although Yannick and I have only played 3 times(he was 2-1), and I must say, I have the utmost respect for this guy. Not only is he a world class player, but he knows how to win/lose graciously. My last 4 games were against him, and I enjoyed every one of them. 
<br />
   In this game, there wasn't really much action. It seemed that Yannick was either hurting from bad feeling/crush, or he never found what he was looking for. Either way, I was draining for most of the game, and only a few of his epp's found their way. We fought some, and he lost. He never retrieved a single force, which I admit, he couldn't, because he never got a foothold into the game. +25
<br />
<br />
FW 10 (+99)
<br />
<br />
Highlights: Only 5-0 player left
<br />
Lows: ummm.....
<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME 6: Yannick Lapointe, Hunt Down
<br />
<br />
This was a really close game, one in which I rescued Han on my 2nd to last turn! Since he had such a tough force guarding the chamber, I left Luke and Ben at the palace and let his own visage do some dirty work. Mara Jade died twice with her saber, and vader died 3 times. I lost my fair share as well, and by the end, all my lukes were gone, so visage definitely did me in. I made an enormous blunder in the end, with Jabba attacking my master luke, and I didn't return him to his hand. If I had used Luke's ability, it would have been game. As it would have it, I lost by 2. I'm kinda glad I did though, because then yannick would make it into the finals with me, and we're both Quebecers!!!!! (Sorry jonathan chu!!)
<br />
<br />
FL 10 (+97)
<br />
<br />
Highlights: Really fun, interactive game
<br />
Lows: I made my only known mistake in the tourney so far
<br />
<br />
So I ended up in first place after the 6 games, but had yet to play Yannick in a 2 game match. And as it is 3 o'clock in the morning, I will NOT be describing those games :) but will instead just tell you I won both of them, and walked away with those 3 cool uncut sheets. I tip my hat to Yannick for some great games, and hope to provide him with more serious competition locally. I don't think the visiting americans did that badly, but I wouldn't know. mouhahahaha...

The store owner apparently made some wise ass remarks to Terwilliger and deserves to be called a !@#!%^$*$ (insert whatever the **** you want).
