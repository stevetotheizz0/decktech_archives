<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Starts off Obis hut and audience chamber unless they start the tat system or a tat site then pull out jabba palace. Get monks to tat sites fast for drain, ignore your opponent, the monk drain will win. If they come down vs. the monks you got your its a traps (follow with luke or obi), houjix, solo han, it can wait and if all else fails chances are that you will draw a five.  Space is not necessary in here, the tessek bumps my drains to 3 each plus the hope shes alright acts like a visage. If they dont come up against the monks, go to them with epps and undercover spies. Heres a list of the tech in here in case there is something you dont quite understand.</p>

<p>4 monks- um they die</p>

<p>8D8- better then artoo cause hes cheaper and can go into the audience chamber with ephant mon there</p>

<p>yoda stew- better then tunnel vision. tunnel visions purpose is to prevent me from drawing my whole force pile to find one card. this allows me to pick up my whole force pile and put back all the excess. Plus its used. much more versitile too as it acts like a traffic control.</p>

<p>it can wait- better then barrier, it just is.</p>

<p>skywalkers/desperate reach- i dont like barrier and they are fives i can put back with stew.</p>

<p>solo han- 2 destiny with a monk.</p>

<p>ooc/shock/eyes open/bith shuffle- these are just in here cause they are 5s that go back. Im tired of people asking why I play with keep your eyes open.</p>

<p>dtf + monk- innitiate with a monk and then retrive one they lose one and the battle is over cause monk dont participateâ€¦it works.</p>

<p>NO barrier in here cause it is getting to popular and @#$%s out here pack mad defense for itâ€¦it can wait is better anyway.</p>

<p>I think thats about it.</p>
