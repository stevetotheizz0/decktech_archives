<p><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>update</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong><strong>*
i am going to put a lsjk for a gold squad 1 in this to help agasint a BHBM and possibly a hunt down. also, i am going to put in a do or do not and wise advice for D&amp;R facilities and goo nee tay.  and if you want to put in a little more sac protection, i think it might not be a bad idea, mabey for a few starships.

<p>stategy</p>

<p>the basic strategy of this deck and every ebo deck is simple, get your space up and balanced fast and drain their pants off; and this is how you do it.
turn 1take echo base garrison and the war room and deploy them, and drop all your land characters to the 4th marker to make sure they dont think about getting prominence on hoth early.  if you got a signal, i generally take out effects in this order
1.rebel fleet
2.incom corp
3.strike planning
4.rebel planners
5.bacta tank
the reason i take those out are
rebel fleetto stop their early drains befor you get all set up
incom corpto get your xwings drawing destiny’s before you can get your fleets out, and to give them a power boost
strike planningto pull dodonna and gen cal; dodonna to double rebel planners, and cal to pilot the falcon or a mon cal
rebel plannersby this time you should have a gospic and you will have the dodonna with strike planning, if you get them earlier, take this effect erlier.  this is a key card for your dominence in space.
bacta tankso you can forfeit your pilots for battle damage, and bring them right back.
after those, the effects really depend on how the game goes, if they keep tryin to come to hoth, bring out ice storm, if you keep losing your ships, take D&amp;R facilities, or if you are experiencing a lot of battles, take out your matelian savrip to reduce your losses, if they have a lot of land, take goo nee tay to slow them down a lot.
after turn 1, take your character with garrison, take out your other two hoth sites.  next turn, take out your character, and take out ebo, and then finally, start taking out your systems, and by that time, you should have plenty of starships to have a fleet up fast.  once you get all your systems up and your fleet balanced out over them, your drains will be pretty steady and secure.  any other advice i can give to you would be mabey thinking of getting a semi super falcon up, which is gen cal and epp han piloting, and miem numb and epp lei sitting in the back seat, you will only get 3 destinies out of that, where as the ”real super falcon with cappy instead of epp han will give you four, i just chose epp because he is more versitile and can be used on land too.</p>

<p>matchups</p>

<p>BHBMi would prob just give him luke, just keep your forces extra concentrated in space so they dont win many battles if any so they cant turn him.</p>

<p>hunt down i didnt even bother putting honor of a jedi in this deck for this matchup, because every decent hunt down is running no escape, so it would be a waste of a card.  so in hunt down, put all your epps to their 1/1 docking bays to take away their battlegrounds to make sure they are losing for visage as well.  try to give them the biggest drain and beatdown in space possible to make them lose their key cards.</p>

<p>ral ops is dead, i dont know hardly anyone who plays it anyomre, so i wont go into that.</p>

<p>sycfa ties get your draining up as fricken fast as possible to make them lose their key cards, but i would try to stay concentrated at your sites so they dont capitolize on your small band of x-wings out force draining, but that is just me, it is up to you on that one.</p>

<p>as for the new jp sealed obj, i have never seen it in action and dont know how it works, so i can comment on that.  if there are any other matchups i didnt metion that you like to know abour d-mail me.  thanks for looking,
