<p>Effects
Imperial Decree
Stop big drains.
Dreaded Imperial Starfleet
Cancel a few drains.
Reactor Terminal
Sienear Fleet Systems x2
ok, you set these up on wakeelumai early to get some force retrieval most of the game.</p>

<p>Interrupts
Short Range Fighters
Retrieve 10 with sienear then 10 more with this.
All Power To Weapons x4
Those ties are pwoer 5 each</p>

<p>Twiâ€™Lek Advisor
Get out decree or somethin else.</p>

<p>Point Man
Cancels some gay cards.</p>

<p>ok, you start wakeelumai and get out SFS. Then you deploy ties and retrieve and drain. If they come to fight, play all power to weapons to have power 5 ties. Eventually you should overpower them and retrieve enough to win the game.</p>
