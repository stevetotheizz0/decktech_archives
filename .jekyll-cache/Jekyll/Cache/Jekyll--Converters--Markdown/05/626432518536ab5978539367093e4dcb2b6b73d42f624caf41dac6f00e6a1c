<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>Start by Deploying Wise Advice to add to your training draws.  I like using DoS because Luke is better with the teamwork destiny adders.  Try to get electrobinocs to DoS ASAP to help with training Destinies.  Once you complete Test 5, assuming you can track a 7, you can use On the Edge to retrieve mass amounts and Surprise Assault to damage opponents and prevent them from draining. (just make sure to leave some active force.) Battle Plan is in there to slow the drains down in the early game, while Transmission Terminated helps with Hunt Down. ‘</p>
