<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>Ok Before you turn you nose up and think ahhh this is JUST another Court Deck playing Scum. Well you couldn’t be more wrong. I am using an old combo that will soon be everyones favorite again, what you ask. I reintroduce to you Dr. Evazan and his Disarming capabilities. The advantage of the Light Side characters with weapons is nuetralized with this stragedy. I was playing this deck the other day and my opponent felt quite superior droping EPP Luke, Han, Leia, ECC Chewie, and Obi-Wan with his Lightsaber in front of me and playing Order to Engage. Bamn My Turn, Activate, Disarm Obi, Operate, Disarm Luke Operate, Disarm Leia, Same, now I drop Mara with Saber, and Dengar with Blaster, not over welming but nice. I start a battle retrieve 2 due to his Draw Their Fire,and my First Strike plus another 2 for Scum, he loses 2, Fire the Blaster at Chewie, hit, operate, he takes a shot at dengar and misses, fire at Han, miss, swing at him and hit, but I don’t operate, I draw a 4 for Attrition and Han is sufficiently wooped. Anyway a long way around telling you how to use this great combo in a deck that plays pretty well, and it’s a whole lot more fun to play then RALOPS or Hunt Down.
Thanks
