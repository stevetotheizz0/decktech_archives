<br />
the kashyyyk regionals came and went with a a bang. the tournament started at about 9:30 but ended at about 6:00. also i was very excited cause i am the youngest state champion out there(12 years old) and i wanted to prove it wasn't a fluke. plus, steve wall was coming down from maine and i wanted to see if he was actualy any good. so here's the pre tourney stuff.....
<br />
<br />
it all started about 3 weeks before regionals. gold 18was giving out the spoilers and i was searching for decks. i found myself on icemans page looking at old tr's i read last years regionals where he had played his firestarter deck. i thought i could revive the deck with ansb as a safe house for oola. my brother(hayes hunter, rated 2088) was in camp so i couldn't play test with him, so i was left with steve beroni(rated 1810) and the schiemrs(both in the 1700's). i was also in a camp so i couldn't play much so i was unable to play with the schiemers. however i skipped the last day of camp(the day before regionals) to play with steve beroni, it was time to test the firestarter deck out. 
<br />
<br />
i arived at steve's house at like 11:00 am andstarted play testing.i first played with light and it sucked! oh my gosh it sucked, however steve's dark deck was excelant but the deck still sucked. so then i made a dark deck. it was a set your course deck wthi myonim omith cause nobody is packing shocks cause of the new anti number/scanning crew efect. i played this for the rest of the day at steve's and liked it. however i was still working on a light deck. i went from a firestarter to a mwyhl space drain to a endor local uprising/trm start. both my decks were ok, but steve still beat me every time, but only by 15-5.
<br />
<br />
now it's like 7:00 and i have not great decks. however we make it so steve can come over and play with my brother who has come back from camp today, also he would play test till the night is old and would sleep over. well we go to my house and we eat a little and then we play test. i play steve again with my light and i just was fed up with the deck, so i made a new objective with asp droids and ewok catapults. it sucked bu i liked the catapult thing. however i played my bro with my dark deck and i lost horrible, he would get a superfalcon to my death  star turn one and i could do nothing. so now it was 11:00 and i was tired i had bad decks and regionals were next day. i set my alarm for 6:00 to get in 2 more hours of play testing and fell asleep.
<br />
<br />
i woke up next morning and woke steve up. both of us tired we went downstairs to refine our decks. steve and my bro talked a lot at night while i was asleep so steve made some changes to his decks whule i made 2 new decks. i liked the 7's thing so i put it pack to the uprising/trm thing and played steve. his deck is very good so i still lost but i did better then anything else i played so i was playing that. for dark i made a rops with a total of 4 d*II cards and played that. i won and i decided to play that.
<br />
<br />
so we we left and got signed up. on to the games.
<br />
<br />
game 1- my light vs. somebody from maine's court deck.
<br />
first off this kid was wearing a hat the had 2 rifles on it, so i was scared that if i won he would shoot me(he actualy did threaten me once). also while we were shuffeling he told me he made this deck a year ago and that he was going to lose... this kid gave himself a real confidence boost. i don't remember much except i saw no d*II cards, he played gamoreans and i retrived 12 force from on the edge. i also drained in space with tycho and wedge in matching ships at kessel and endor.easy win.
<br />
2 +24
<br />
overall 2 +24
<br />
<br />
highs: winning. giving me a confedince boost with my light deck.
<br />
lows: nothing.

<br />
game 2 dark vs. shawn mcarthy test to 6.
<br />
i got my objective flipped without any at-st's and got out search and destroy. from there he lost 4-5 force on my turn and 1 force his turn. even though he had honor out i spread i ocupied 3 batlegrounds.he eventualy did flip his objective but i had at-st's out by then and he had very little force left. i won handily by 20

game 3 my light vs. brian cyzenski's(1879) cct/ emp's prize.
<br />
brian is one of my friends and i don't enjoy playing my friends very much. so we started playing i and got out 2 nudj's first turn and 3 twixes. from there i drained in space while htting him on the ground, i made sure never to have luke in the carbron chamber in case of all too easy. he played some sac so i coudn't pull off many retriveal with my 7's so instead i uesd them to shoot lord vader and tarkin and stuff. however i pulled off on the edge 2 times when he activated all his force so he couldn't sense it. i retrived 2 times for 12 force my great start and 7's one me the game.
<br />

<br />
<br />
game 4 drak vs erik markarians ebo with mon cal's.
<br />
from reading decktech i knew i would eat his deck like pie. i got a quick flip and got search and destroy out. i also gor decree going to he could only drain at my death ctar for 2. he beat me up in space but i was able to run and control 2 sytems and 1 site. he also tried to stop search and destroy by putting down some 2/2 guys at north ridge. but they were met by vader and some at-st's. in a last ditch effort he tried to attack my ralitir site but i came back and smacked jedi luke for 10 force.easy win.

game 5 light vs. andy's tat ocupation
<br />
agian i don't remember much about this game. however i tried to make a early space presence with tala 2 with blout and spiral. he then came with zuckuss and bosk and saving some force and made me loss blount. i then moved spiral to endor to drain there for the rest of the game. thi game was very action packed. me going on the ground diceing and herc seffing. honor of the jedi stopping ocupation some times. me retriving a total of 24 force with on the edge and catapults. andy had a very good deck and played it very well, however my deck was just too much for him.
<br />
2 +14
<br />
overall 10 +96
<br />
<br />
highs: great game. andy is a great persont o play against. 
<br />

<br />
<br />
steve brenston also won but he also played light so i couldn't play him. steve brenston was almost guranteed to make it to the finals but if i lost i wouldn't make but my brother would.
<br />
<br />
game 6 my dark vs. micheal schiemers hyper destiny adders mains
<br />
instead of my usual start i stared bad felling cause he has been playing a deck like this for tha last 2 tournies.this turned out to be a good decision.i started by drawing alot. i also then put down some space, bosk and a dreadnaught. he followed with han leia and a medical frigate, batled and played i know. i had to lose my ships and a few. he just fell into my trap. from there i started to flip my objective because what i acomplished by him coming after me in space was making him spend all his force so obi and luke couldn't come after me together and i took leia and han out of the ralitiir equastions for a while. well i fliped my objective and og t search and detroy out. he came after me with luek and be and stuff but he couldn't find a week spot cause of my reacting at-st's. so in the end i just out battled him and stuff.
<br />
2 + 14
<br />
overall 12 +110
<br />
<br />
highs: great game. i had a losing streak against mike and i finnaly broke it.
<br />
lows: none.
<br />
<br />
well i did it! i made it to the finals steve brenston won hit last game by i4 so he ended up at 12 +135.
<br />
<br />
i got to play steve in th finals for kashyyyk regionals, here's the games.
<br />
<br />
duel game number 1. my dark vs.  his light profit/ non-uniqe aliens
<br />
he got a quick flip but i took a while cause i ws trying to stop the profit damage by throwing out vader and some walkers at some mains. i eventualy flipped  but i was lossing the damage race like 6-3. he was also canceling my drains with baraging table so i could do nothing. i got my space out late and i didn't get batle order out like i wanted. he won the first one.
<br />
 0 - 23
<br />
<br />
deul game number 2. my light vs. his big blue dark.
<br />
i got out some quick drains in space while he jest drew and drew and drew. he eventualy put out executer with some 2/2 guys. i reacted with super falcon and th spiral. i batlled and made him lose 2 2/2 guys. but i had to lose spiral. he then lateraled damaged the falcon ang came after it, i drew 2 7's and a 0. he had to lose a bunch. while we have been batling in space he had dropped bubo down and ate a nudj and ploped some walkers and crappers down. i responded with obi and twass and wege and a rouge squadron pilot. i batled and we had a 3 force swing plue he lost every thing. however he had trampled my asp droid so i would have to retirve the old fashiond way, by tracking. i eventualy was able to retirve 2 time for 6 each. i was also in control of the board. i had a drain of 6 and he had a drain of 1 but he had to pay three for it. however he new i had more retrival coming so he drew up when i had 20 cards left for life force....
<br />
2 +20
<br />
overall 2 -3. 
<br />
<br />
so steve won the kashyyyk regionals and as i look back on it he picked his light to go  first because he knew he would win with it, so he would be able to draw up and win.
<br />
