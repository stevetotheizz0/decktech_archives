<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>This deck is very very fun to play. You totally control their ground drains and you have plenty of space power. First, use mob. points to get wakeelumai out(if it is in your hand, get executor out). Get some locations out and deploy dreadnaughts then your free ties. Control the skies and drain, use presence to help. If they start ground drains, simply put down one of the 5 undercovers spies to stop the drain. If they play a deck that is in space, you should have plenty of power to fight em off Just throw down a dreadnaught and a couple of free ties to each site. All power and Dark Maneuvers will help too. Late game, use all power to get out lots and lots of ties then use short range to retrieve. Use sienar and the ties (and squadrons) to retrieve up to 24 force. (deploy all ties, sabers, sword and shield, assault squadron, then the three ties that were put in the used pile with the squadron.) Also anytime you lose a tie, they go to used pile for more retrieval. So, unless they use indirect damage, then it will be hard to lose Remember, The ISB objective is just to stop their drains with undercovers spies.  â€˜</p>
