<p>edit2 Gen is born retart. If some one playing froce choke deck you do not need a system for the menace fades. If u read the cards a little it will help u under stand. qui qon make them redraw there destnies from reserve deck. What was that makes them +1 after the first dueling. So u should have 8 for each draw. U got enough sevens to deal with strike blocking. U pull grabbers with defensive shields. Like i told in my stradegy space is for hoth or dark deal. Its a preventive measure. Seriously dude u need to look at the cards before u give peoples ratings. This deck will beat any deck u put front of it.</p>

<p>edit Invasion is not what this deck is worried about. With intruder missiles as destinies draws and controling inner naboo sites there should not be a problem.</p>

<p>Goo nee tay is a great card with this deck. But i like to stop the early force drains quick. Battle order gives me time to set up if need it. U never no when u will get a bad hand.</p>

<p>stop edit</p>

<p>This is a powerful dueling deck. The card selection is very powerful and suprising. This deck had succes against all the major decks in current play.</p>

<p>some card choices</p>

<p>Suprise assualt WIth the high destinies in here there is a no brainer. This is a side stradegy.</p>

<p>on the edge No problem with high destinies and activation</p>

<p>Naboo this is a decision time. If you see dark deal or high ground drain use menace fades and naboo system no problem.</p>

<p>What was it This is a high under used card in the dueling process i believe. After the first dueling process all ur dueling destinies are +1 and with sevens laugh at opponents.</p>

<p>Obi wan with stick Can not be circled with some red cards. Put him at generator and make him +2 and with saber built in he is +4. no problem there</p>

<p>caldrean h This guy is made for this deck. Put him behind a jedi and they are safe from a big beat down.</p>

<p>First couple of turns</p>

<p>Activate and deploy a jedi if possible. If not drew some and start the race. Matters on what they are playing start the drain race and dare them to come to naboo for dueling. This way u can make them out of commision and drain safely.</p>
