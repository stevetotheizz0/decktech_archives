I"×<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Here I go with my first tournament report since last September...
<br />
<br />
Brad Vogel finally was able to have tournaments at Tri-county again. The first one was supposed to be last weekend he cancelled at the last minute. I still showed with Wayne Cullen because neither of us got the email in time. We played some fun games and I got back into playing mode. Brad scheduled another one for this weekend but couldnâ€™t get it sanctioned because of the 14-days advance rule. 
<br />
<br />
I finished up my trimester exams on Tuesday so I started to think up decks. I know having nothing from Reflections 3 and Theed Palace will eventually hurt me. I get lazy and just take the decks I had been working on in October: BHBM choke thing for dark and WYS w/rogue speeders for lightside. 
<br />
<br />
So I get to the place at around 12 and see Brad. He gives me my 2 packs of Coruscant that I was supposed to get back in September. I pull a Senator Palpatine and a Destroyer Droid which was kind of cool. I buy some Reflections 3 packs and get a Lord Maul which isnâ€™t too bad. Me and Brad start a game and Sam and Alex show up shortly after. Here I go with my pre-R3 decks.
<br />
<br />
Game 1: My DS BHBM Vs. Brad Vogel (1892) Profit
<br />
Brad starts Profit and EPP Han. Then he has his shield thing, Aim High &amp; Insurrection, this fish effect from R3, and some DS2 effect that cancels You are beaten and some other stuff. I put Mara and Dr E with Ponda Boba at the Audience Chamber and I start my stuff: Crush the Rebellion, Blaster Rack (v), and IAO/SP. I pull a 1/0 docking bay, deploy the Emperor to Jabbaâ€™s Palace, deploy Bad Feeling Have I, and pull some stuff out of my deck. On his turn he deploys Goo Nee Tay and the Battle Plan shield, then he draws I think. I drain and pull Maraâ€™s stick and move her and Dr E outside. I eventually get out Janus as well. Brad puts naked 3PO inside the AC with the new Leia so I stop draining. I deploy P-59 inside to kill Leia and I get out First Strike. I miss my shot and I only kill 3PO. I decide to move Mara and Evazan inside but theyâ€™re killed by an EPP with saber I think. I have the Emperor and Janus outside now and Brad kills both of them with EPP Qui-gon. Then Brad plays Resilience to get him back. I then battle Leia inside to retrieve both of Palpy and Janus. I get out Lord Vader with saber and he forgets about Your Destiny damage. He sends out a suicide EPP Luke to kill someone and he loses to Your Destiny again. I pull Palpy out again and Vader and him are draining for 3 outside. Brad gives me EPP Luke. Later on, Brad puts the new Lando with EPP Han and flips. They move to Vaderâ€™s site and I try to Sniper Lando but he plays Itâ€™s a Trap. The site gets cleared and EPP Luke is left. I drain with Palpatine and Janus at a docking bay and he comes down with EPP Qui-gon. He swings at the Emperor and I play Force Field. I lose Janus but I redeploy one from my hand next turn. Then choke Vader with saber goes to where Han and Luke are. I capture Luke and then battle Han for some overflow to win. I win by 21.
<br />
FW 2(+21)
<br />
Highlights: Winning without post-Coruscant cards, Force Field!!
<br />
Lowlights: I had no idea what that fish card did really and he played 5 Jediâ€™s Resiliences
<br />
<br />
Weâ€™re all hungry so we go across the street to Nathans. We talk about our plans for DPC Tri-county and tournaments at my house. Good stuff.. I eat a bacon cheeseburger and on the way out we get to watch some kid playing DDR (Dance Dance revoluton or something).
<br />
<br />
Game 2: My LS WYS Vs. Alex Warshow (1664) Destroyer Droids
<br />
He starts the Senate, the shield thing, IAO/SP, and something else. I start Aim High/Insurrection, Your Insight/Staging Areas, and Squadron Assignments. He puts out Lott Dod and some new card that gives him more force at the Senate. I grab a docking bay, deploy Battle Plan, and draw up. He puts out Allegations, some other card, and the WYS counter card. I put Mirax in her ship to Tatooine, put Melas to Cantina, and drop two cheap smugglers to the Senate. I clear out Lott Dod and let him go. Xizor and a Destroyer droid beat up Melas and I flip back. On my turn I put EPP Han, Melas, and Talon Karde to reclaim the Cantina. I drain for 4 a turn but he cancels the 2 at the Cantina with the Destroyer droid card. He kicks me out of the Cantina with EPP Maul I think. I put ECC Chewie to my Tat: DB and reflip. He drops 3 destroyer droids but I dodge away. I put a Raltiir Captain with Chewie inside the Cantina. Now everything goes downhill. He puts out Evazan and a Destroyer Droid to the Cantina. Then he plays Rolling, Rolling, Rolling to move P-60 over. Then he battles, operates on a hit Chewie and casues me 6 overflow. I save up and drop Rogue 3 with Wedge and a RFC to clear 3 Destroyer Droids from the docking bay. Alex was just shocked to see my deploy that speeder. Eventually he shoots that down and I canâ€™t shoot at his droids with stupid Oh, Switch Off. He clears me off the ground and puts Maul in ship to space. Lott Dodd and Yeb Yeb kick me out of the Senates and he locks up his win. I put EPP Luke to space and after two battles there, Maul in ship remain. He spreads out to some CC sites and he retrieves with Squabbling. I decide to draw up at the end and he wins by 21.

Highlights: clearing out senate on turn 3, killing 3 destroyer droids with Rogue 3
<br />
Lowlights: The rest of the game basically
<br />
<br />
In the other game next to me, I got to witness Sam draw two blind sevens vs Brad. Then Samâ€™s General Blissex (NWA?) goes up against an EPP Vader and Vader misses!!! Hahahahahahaha.... That was the saddest thing I ever saw in my life.
<br />
<br />
So I come in a respectable third. Oh wait, there were only 4 people... Well there was no prize support, not that it matters...
<br />
Standings:
<br />
Sam Diamond 2-0
<br />
Alex Warshow 2(+12?)
