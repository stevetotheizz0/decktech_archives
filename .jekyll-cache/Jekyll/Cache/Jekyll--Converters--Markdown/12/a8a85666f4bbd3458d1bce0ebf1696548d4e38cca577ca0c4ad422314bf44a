I"Á<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">ItÂ’s here! It is finally here!!! Every week I wait for Saturday because of one thing.  SW:CCG tourneyÂ’s at the local shop, Champion Cards &amp; Comics. So I wanted to share my fun with my friends so all week I had been teaching my friend, Robert.  All week I trained my new apprentice (Robert) for the local tourney.  I invited him over the night before but he couldnÂ’t make it but, he did come over the morning of the tourney to go the tourney. So we come together to Champion Cards &amp;Comics but I couldnÂ’t play him to help him learn more but we arrive a little early and sign him up and we get ready.  He used the deck I wasnÂ’t using at the time. (Props to Kevin for allowing him to use my deck.
<br />
<br />
Since this was the new Endor/DS II format, pretty much the decks were much similar so I knew what to expect.  I made sure that I had enough ground and space to be able to control both, if I needed to be on the ground I stayed there and the same for space.
<br />
<br />
Round One Â– The Battle Starts!
<br />
My LS ground/space vs. JonathanÂ’s space and slightly some grounds stuff.
<br />
<br />
I already knew what he was playing.  Lately in regular tournaments he has been playing the big blue in space.  I went straight to the ground and started Battle Plan and Squadron Assignments.  I start, some how with a good ground force with Midge and General Solo.  Get that down first turn then draw some.  He gets Flag. Executor out second turn and later the Thunderflare. But I deploy in space slowly and start draining. Back and forth I went in space from planet to planet and he followed.  I got out the Homey One and he split up his group thinking he could catch me  at a single planetÂ… He was wrong I deployed more space and battled. He loses some. I drain him to death and I havenÂ’t deployed much so I win by a lot!

(+28)

<br />
Total 2(+28)
<br />
Props Â– Beating Jonathan who I thought would spank me. Also my friend did well playing with my DS but he lost.
<br />
Slops: Not getting Chewie of Kashyykk out.

<br />
<br />
Game Two Â– The Onslaught Begins
<br />
My DS ground walkers/Space star destroyers vs.??? (Sorry I canÂ’t spell his name)
<br />
<br />
Well I started Combat Response/Battle Order/Something Special Planned For Them.  Well I started with 2 Star Destroyers and the rest ground stuff including a few walkers.  The guy who I played was a newbie like me and played like me. He never drew too much and he managed his force wellÂ… but he spread his forces too thin.  I beat him battling both in space and in on the ground but he force drained me well and one of his effects kept me for force draining him for awhile. But I pull it out and win by 8.
<br />
<br />
Total: 4(+36)
<br />
Props: Having a good social time and I had fun.
<br />
Slops: Not winning by much.
<br />
<br />
Round Two Â– Ding Ding Ding
<br />
<br />
Game Three my LS vs. Robert PurcellÂ’s DS( actually my DS)
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well this is my apprentice. Though I have been playing only for a few weeks I had taught him and he seems to be having fun.  Before the game I told him I wouldnÂ’t hold back. I didnÂ’t.  I got to the ground quicklyÂ… There isnÂ’t much to say accept he did well keeping me from draining but I smacked him. I got homey one going and battled and pretty much dominated.
<br />
(+14)
<br />
<br />
Total: 6(+50)
<br />
<br />
Props: Beating my friendÂ….
<br />
Slops: Not beating by much.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4 Â– The Big Finale
<br />
<br />
My DS vs. RobertÂ’s LS.
<br />
<br />
Well I am playing my apprentice again =)!  Well I get walkers down quick! Wahoo and he gets his space machine up with the Defiance and Liberty and a non-unique Cruiser after a turn or 2.  Third turn I get Visage and 3 ties out where he had his lone  Homey One. Smack him there and go on. Running from him where his main space force comes. On the Ground he kepy running from my walkers led by Arnet. Robert Marches right into a loss.
