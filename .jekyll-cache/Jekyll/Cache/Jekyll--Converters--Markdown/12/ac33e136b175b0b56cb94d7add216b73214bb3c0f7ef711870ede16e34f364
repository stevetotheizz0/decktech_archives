<p>Strategy: ‚Äò</p>

<p>Before Strat I want to point something out to my fellow decktechers. I review decks alot‚Ä¶ and I mean alot and I also read every review on every deck I review. It helps me figure what the mindset of players these days are‚Ä¶</p>

<p>You guys are nuts‚Ä¶ and mean too. I‚Äôve seen 20 decks given horrible reviews and insulted because they started Mobilization Points‚Ä¶ cause Don‚Äôt Do That Again‚Ä¶ Why are you nuts? As said I review lots of decks and read almost all of them and let me tell you that in the last 48 hours all but two lightside decks submitted haven‚Äôt played DDTA at all (and one of them now says they don‚Äôt). Hell you guys don‚Äôt just not start it‚Ä¶ you plain don‚Äôt use it. Figuring out who‚Äôs using it isn‚Äôt that hard either. If their racing‚Ä¶ no. If they start a planet (‚Ä¶ no. If they need key effects (EBO and MBO)‚Ä¶ no. Profit‚Ä¶ maybe check the Han they deploy if General probably not. Agents‚Ä¶ possible check the agent if their using an actual agent then probably not. Rescue Leia‚Ä¶ not unless their nuts that deck is hard enough without wasting a starter. HB‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶ your kidding they give battleground systems. Good in Him‚Ä¶ good chance especially if they play scout luke. Training‚Ä¶ normal no but maybe. Non-objective‚Ä¶ most no but any that start Slave Quarters is trouble. And if your still worried play Your Insight and pull it when you see they don‚Äôt have it.</p>

<p>Ahh‚Ä¶ that was long. Anyway that said I usually start Mob. not Fanfare(the dark side of DDTA ironically). I posted different to show you can.</p>

<p>First off flipping isn‚Äôt the big point of this deck, it is a perk if they stop you it‚Äôs okay. Your there to battle and drain big.</p>

<p>Second stress on getting as much force generation out as possible use Presense on Ralltir itself. If possible deploy Early Warning to DB‚Ä¶ this is huge because most your ship deploy free when they go to Ralltir as Reacts.</p>

<p>Third‚Ä¶ use fanfare to pull mostly armless when you need it.</p>

<p>Signal For What you Need.</p>

<p>Battle and Drain‚Ä¶ use Force Field and Lighting used only to protect your Sith and hammer Jedi. Expanded either the forest for immunity or the Prefect office for power and forfeit +3.</p>

<p>Your have three Dark Jedi and lots of Imperials, use your two DP‚Äôs only when your sure it‚Äôs devastating.</p>

<p>On the occasions when your objective is flipped use it‚Äôs bonus‚Äôs to their fullest.</p>
