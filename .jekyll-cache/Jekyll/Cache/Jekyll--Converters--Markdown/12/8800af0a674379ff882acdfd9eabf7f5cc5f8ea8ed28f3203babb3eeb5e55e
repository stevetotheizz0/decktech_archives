     Ok, we had 2 four game tourney-s in 2 days. I wasn-t gonna write one for either but then I decided to write one for both so back off... I-m rated 1809 going in to this thing.
<br />
<br />
Saturday-s Deck-s~~  Decks are WYS with Palace Raiders for light, and for dark Abyssin MKOS without Gailid, any grabbers, or any space. 13 people show up.
<br />
<br />
Game 1~ Abyssins vs. Jason-s (the new guy at 1500) Dagobah turtle deck... yup that-s right
<br />
<br />
He starts with Dagobah as his starting location. No Objective. I was freaked out. I-ve only played in a sealed deck tourney 1 other time with this fool so I didn-t know if he knew what he was doing or not at this point. I had dismissed him as a scrub, but I thought I might be mistaken. Yeah right... He tried to Combat Readiness or whatever it is for 2 non-unique sites to Dagobah. Game over right? I drew the AC in my opening hand so I pull Lower Passage and no longer have 0-s in my deck. I pull Mighty J and pair him with an Abyssin. He pulls the swamp with Dago text. I put Bib at JP and an Abyssin at LP to flip. Lose YCHF for S&amp;D. Deploy it, move abyssin to JP with Bib. He deploys Yoda-s house and DOS to it. Then encampment and an ithorian. WTF! He revo-s the Hut and moves the Ithorian to the swamp. My turn. Drian 1 at JP. He plays Surprise Assault, and he draws a 7 and a 1. I lose 2. Having learned my lesson, I pull Hutt Influence with POTH. I put Xizor with Abyssin at LP. He deploys Wedge t the encamped site and moves him. I blocked his drains with an abyssin to Den o Thieves and an abyssin to the lost pile to retrieve it. So we continue draining each other but my cancellation and S&amp;D caught up to him. If I had CHYBC I would have won with just S&amp;D. When the game ended he had as follows:
<br />
Y-s Hut with DOS w/Reflection
<br />
Dagobah Swamp with Ben Kenobi with Jedi lightsaber and Lightsaber Pro. And Figrin
<br />
Non-U swamp with Ithorian
<br />
<br />
I pull off the win by 9.
<br />
2(+9)
<br />
Props: none
<br />
Slops: almost losing to Dagobah Turtle deck 3 years after it was at its best.
<br />
<br />
Game 2~WYS vs. Avery Poliak-s (1723) COTVG
<br />
He starts POTH, Secret Plans, and something else. I forgot what. His turn he draws and says go. I say wait. Lose 1 to court. LOL. My turn Squadass for Wedge and Red Squadron 1. Lose 1 to court and go. He deploys SE Jabba, SAV, and Ephant Mon to the AC. I respond with I-ll Take The Leader, A Palace Raider in Lars Family Speeder, Melas and Mirax. Then he deploys 4LOM w/gun and Boba w/gun. He battles. WTF! He says, cancel Palace Raiderâ€™s text. I say no, the vehicle is enclosed. We go to a ruling and you know how that turned out. He frowns and cancels Mirax-s text. Tries to shoot Mirax w/Fett. Misses. Tries to hidden weapons. Draws a 1. I draw 3 battle destiny and his guys die. I deployed some more guys and Celebrated on Tatooine. He tried to come to space late, but it wasn-t enough. I won with no cards in the lost pile by 34.
<br />
4(+43)
<br />
<br />
Props: Winning with ease, sorry Avery.
<br />
Slops: Winning with ease, sorry Avery. You know what to do though... get back on the scene
<br />
<br />
Game 3 WYS vs. Jeff Lavigne-s (1736) Copied Weekend At Brugge Winner Rops
<br />
I start Ounee Ta, Squadass and Battle Plan. He has regular Rops junk. Iao and Mob Pts and junk. So basically, I get flipped fast with my lowered deploy on Raltiir and he kills my Lars Speeders with High Speed Tactics. He also tramples a few raiders until Talon shows up. We battle back and forth, he flips his objective a few times, 0 to 7, 7 to 0, 0 to 7... we battle and move around trying to manage drains and stuff. Finally I get him off the board and get a win in a close game. FW by 3.
<br />
6(+46)
<br />
<br />
Props: Beating Raltiir. It still has merit. I hate it, but like to play using it...
<br />
Slops: Not much. We had a good game. Well HST sucks... and Trample...
<br />
<br />
At this point we have 3 undefeated players on the same side. Me, Chris Hines, and Kris Lavigne. I can-t win the tournament unless they both lose coz my differential is lower than theirs.
<br />
<br />
Game 4 Abyssin Swarm vs. Jeff-s CC Sabaac
<br />
Well, no Gailid means small drains, and no grabbers means uncontrollable sabaac(k)ing. Not sure how that would be spelled. So I try to fight him down, retrieving with SAV and 1st Strike, cycling a Ghhhk. He plays an OOC and nails the Ghhhk. I lose at all sabaacs but 1 when I snagged his GliG1. He finally got Pucumber Piss to CC and the drains get nasty and I lose by 24. There isn-t a lot of detail to explain on this game. He-d sabaac and retieve more than I drained for, and I would battle and retrieve, but I started losing characters.
<br />
6(+22)
<br />
<br />
Props: Jeff for getting revenge
<br />
Slops: Jeff for using Sabaac
<br />
<br />
So the tourney ends as follows:
<br />
1st: Chris Hines (got decree foil)
<br />
2nd: Tim Guzman
<br />
3rd: Troy Caswell
<br />
4th: Dan Christy (me)
<br />
<br />
Sunday-s tourney: Well, a quick 4 gamer before the Jedi Knights demo goes down. Only 10 people however. Decks are as follows: MKOS Abyssin Swarm with Gailid and a lil bit o space. But still no grabbers. and the same WYS.
<br />
<br />
Game 1 WYS vs. Jeff-s Rops
<br />
Again huh? Well this one was pretty lop-sided. I knew what to do right off. Talon hit fast with alot of backup. I took cotrol fast and killed anyone he deployed. He never managed a flip, and I never flipped back. FW by 34
<br />
2(+34)
<br />
<br />
props: Me for getting a high differential
<br />
slops: none
<br />
<br />
Game 2 Abyssins vs. Kris Lavigne-s (1884) HBX
<br />
We all know that MKOS kills HB. He setup his space and I was blocking drains with Den O Thievery. 3rd turn, I had Mighty J and Gailid at the AC, and A couple dudes at JP. Put an abyssin at the lower passages to flip and move heem to JP for protection. I had also setup S&amp;D but I forgot it alot and I am a scrub. Dammit. He brought JK Luke to the AC and fought. He killed Jabba but Gailid stayed. My turn, I deploy No Escape, get back Mighty J. Deploy him to AC with Myo and 3 Abyssins. POTH Bib to JP. Battle and draw a total of 8 for destiny. He loses Luke, ICBW for 5 damage and loses a couple more. So we drain back and forth after I put Chall and abyssin at the Passages and capture his Boushh. Lte in the game I bust out with Zuckuss in his little jet, battle some x-wings and retrieve a grip. A late All Wings keeps him in a little longer, but  eventually get him after Abyssin Ornamenting for 7. 
<br />
FW by 19 I think
<br />
4 (+53)
<br />
<br />
Game 3 WYS vs. John Spadora=s (1577) Copied Brangus Superstar
<br />
QWIK NOTE: John had beat Matt Berta before this game. Huge upset. No offense to John, but it was and everyone knows it.
<br />
<br />
He set up fast, and I couldn-t get up any activation to save my life. I drew and got 2 JK Lukes and 2 EPP Hans, and e plyed Unexpected Interruption after SCrewing me and removing Chewie. I thought he-d get monnok but it wasn-t there. I did manage to get down some palace raiders in the speeders. He had at this point taken over my Mos Eisley and my Cantina.I got Dash to Tatooine and set up Celebration. I managed to battle him off of Mos Eisley. We exchanged drains for a bit, but mine were free coz I fulfilled battle plan. He was killing me with Miyoom Onith. I was hurt for characters. I got out No Questions Asked and moved Han into the Cantina on my control phase. I deployed Mirax and battled. He had IG-88, Janus, and Davin Felth. I shot IG and he missed the capture on Mirax. I drew some sweet destiny and cleared the site. By now he had Jade at the Back Door draining but I would plat Control/TV everytime. I would celebrate, track it and draw it. eventually I drained him out. Win by 19 but it was closer tha  it sounds.
<br />
6(+73)
<br />
<br />
props: John for playing a good game
<br />
slops: IG-88 for missing a crucial capture
<br />
<br />
Game 4 vs Jeff Lavigne-s Sabaac.
<br />
WTF! 4 out of 8 games against the same guy. Oh well, Jeff is pretty cool. This time I had Gailid so I had drains that could hurt him. Plus I had Monnok in my hand the whole game. He had deployed Lando and EPP Obi to the casino and drew. Before he was ready to get rid of his first double od sabaac, I monnok-ed. Got those. My turn, No Escape to get back Monnok. In his hand he only had EPP Luke, and I had a ghhhk, so I wasnâ€™t afraid to spread thin early. I put an abyssin at the passages, and Ephont and an abyssin at the CC Lower Corridor. Flip. He bring Luke to the lone abyssin in Jabba-s house. I play Wounded Wookie. He battles and I use a Myo to stop his draw. I recycle the abyssin. My turn, Myo to AC, some abyssins to Myo and battle. He loses a few. Later I monnok and kill alot of stuff, deploy an abyssin where he has Lando and battle retrieve my 3 and ghhhk out the damage. He activates and I masterful move to get the Monnok back. After that, his fate was sealed and I complete my destiny. Win by 26
<br />
8(+99) (I think)
<br />
<br />
So I finally win a tourney. I was a chronic 2nd placer, but I finally broke out of that. By that time Kendrick and Kyle showed up and they brought prize support. YUP!!!! Decipher brought us 2 boxes of R2. I got 10 packs for winning. It kicked ass. Final was as follows:
<br />
1st: Dan Christy (me)
<br />
2nd: Kris Lavigne
<br />
3rd: Robert Corbett
<br />
4th: John Spadora
<br />
<br />
So I stayed for the Jedi Knights demo and it was pretty cool. It is what YJ should have been like, and then people would have liked it. It is easy, but strategic. And Vader with his Lightsaber is a one Sith wrecking crew. 
<br />
<br />
Also I started playing Raw Deal, so if you have any foils for the Rock or HHH let me know. I-ll trade Wars or what little rares from Raw Deal that I have for them.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my TR and hope to see you clowns here for the DPC!!!
