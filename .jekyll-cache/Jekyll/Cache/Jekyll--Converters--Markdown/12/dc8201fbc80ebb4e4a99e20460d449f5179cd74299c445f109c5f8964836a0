<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>This deck is designed to keep your opponent guessing until your set up, hopefully by then it will be to late for them to do anything about it.</p>

<p>This deck is also self contained, meaning, no one should be deployed away from any of your locations except undercover spys.</p>

<p>Your 5th turn you should be draining for around 10, by then you shoud be set up at bespin, both sites, and some clouds. At least 1/2 of your drain should be unmodifiable because of the objective. Make sure there is alot of backup for Bespin, you need to keep that system</p>

<p>Try to hook up your studly ground characters with plastoid armor curtosy of the eloms, power &amp; forefit +2, and &lt;6 weapon destiny needed to hit are all very good things. Slso get your bothans undercover to any ground drains that hurt.</p>

<p>Retrieval is also big, Celebration will give you 2 most of the game because you WILL have control of Bespin, and the sabbac playing should keep you in the money because Lando is a pimp.</p>

<p>The main keys to this deck are, Lando is a handy guy, keep him around and he can save the game for you, and donâ€™t, under any circumstances loose control of Bespin, itâ€™s nessary. Bottom line, if you loose control of Bespin and cant get it back you will loose the game.</p>

<p>Well, tell me what you think, any and all comments appreciated greatly. Thanks.</p>
