<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>Start
There is Still Good In Him/I Can Save Him
Endor Chief Chirpa’s Hut
  -Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and Luke’s
Lightsaber at the hut
Endor Landing Platform (Docking Bay)
I Feel The Conflict (Effect that deploys with the objective)</p>

<p>Heading For the Medical Frigate (Starting Interrupt)
  -Squadron Assingments
  -Insurrection
  -Staging Area
*(Note DO NOT TAKE OUT INSURRECTION OR STAGING AREA.  THEY ARE KEY TO THE DECK)</p>

<p>As for the Game play of the deck</p>

<p>On your first turn, you will be activating 7 force alone by yourself (2 from the hut, 2 from the docking bay, 2 from Luke unless an imperial is at the landing platform, and 1 for yourself.)  Deploy the Home One docking bay from your reserve deck.	Deploy a scrub character there to gain the extra force generation.  On the following turns, deploy the spaceport docking bay to the planet that the opponet is located.  If you come across an Endor/Death Star II based deck wait until you have deployed one of your systems or the opponet has deployed a system.  The idea is that you are deploy a 1/1 site where your activating 2 force and the opponet only drains you of 1.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the total activation of the deck for the Light and dark side</p>

<p>-Without effect 13/5
-With effect 17/5
-Controling all docking bays 21/5
-Including Aquaris and Luke 26/5</p>

<p>The idea of the deck is to battle.  You can control space by deploying pilots with their matching pilots.  There are many enhancing cards towards battle such as the weapons, the EPPs, interrupts, the Admiral Orders, and the effect Crack Shot.  It is possible to win only 3 battles and ensure a lot of 6 (Of which 8 cards have destiny of 6 or higher) in your reserve deck when you attempt to cross vader over.  If you don’t have a lot of 6’s in your reserve deck, win 4 battles and draw a 3 (20 cards in the deck).  Cross Vader over and game over.</p>

<p>If the opponet is playing Ral Ops, and ovoiding Luke all together, deploy a spaceport DB to Ral on your first turn. Move Luke to the Endor DB.	Second turn, move to Ral and have an Imp capture Luke.	The opponet now has to lose 2 force unless Vader is escorting Luke.  The Lightside Visage.</p>

<p>Now to explain the cards</p>

<p>Why No Cap’n Han and Super Falcon?  I used the EPPs and Slight weapons malfunction to hold the ground forces.	I use General Calrissian and Nien to hold space in their mini-super Faclon.</p>

<p>Why 2 Luke’s?	There are a few things that the opponet can do.  They could send Aliens after Luke and try to kill him (Using 4-Lom to cancel his game text).  That would really hurt the deck.  The Second Luke is a back up incase that happens.  Besides, Luke is a destiny of 6.</p>

<p>Why the 2 Admiral Orders?  First, they are destiny of 6.  Second, they help out the deck.  All of my Unique starships are immune to attrition &lt;4 (or adds 2 to the immunity).  Opponet’s starships without pilot characters aboard are power -2.  That could hurt the bounty hunters in space.  Remember, All I have to do is win the battle.  My force drains at docking bays related to systems I orbit are +1.  And my starfighters can be relocated to a docking bay if they are lost from a battle.  Get one with Admiral Ackbar and the other ensures that it will stay on the table.</p>

<p>Honor of the Jedi kills any card that makes you lose force.  Bye, Bye Visage.</p>

<p>Aquaris I can generate 4 force there and risk only a drain of 1.</p>

<p>Dantooine Reduces the deployment of starships.  I thought about the R. Point, but I knew I couldn’t get anywhere after they are deployed.</p>

<p>Crack Shot Shot starships and they can’t satisfy attrition. Nice.</p>

<p>X-wing Laser Cannon If Zuckuss in Ship is still hanging around after the admrial orders, deploy on Hobbie’s ship Red Sqaudron 4.  Use 2 force to make X=3 and bye, bye Zuckuss.  Can take out the Baron as well if your destiny is right.</p>

<p>Steady Aim It can add 2 or 4 to a weapon destiny draw.  Blue Squadron 5 adds 2 to weapon destiny, Ten Nunb adds 2 to weapon destiny, Intruder Missle can add 3 to the weapon destiny if the captial was targeted during the battle.  Add Steady Aim for 4 and you have a weapon destiny of 11 with out drawing destiny.  You can take out any star destroyer you want, even the Executor.</p>

<p>Enhanced Proton Torpedoes I took out a Victory Class Star Destroyer with one of these at the recent Death Star Pre-Release.</p>

<p>A Few Maneuvers Add 2 to the maneuver of any starship, used interrupt, destiny 6.  Enough said.</p>

<p>Why the Maneuvers, Proton Torps, and Missles?  If the opponet is playing Endor Ops. where they set up the Death Star and That’s Things Operational, attack the Death Star and Blow it away.</p>

<p>Colonel Cracken is good anywhere, in space or on land.	Choice wisely according to where the opponet is strong in forces.</p>

<p>As a few reminders, Luke can be captured by an Imp on a walker.  All Luke has to do is be at the site of the Imp (Read the objective).</p>

<p>Also, unless and Imp is at the Endor DB, don’t forget to drain of 1 at Chief Chripa’s hut on your first turn.
