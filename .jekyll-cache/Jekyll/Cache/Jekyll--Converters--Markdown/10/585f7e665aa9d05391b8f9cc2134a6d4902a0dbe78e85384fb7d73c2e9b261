<p>Fanfare â€˜</p>

<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>strategy</p>

<p>the watto strategy isnâ€™t really hard to understand or to explain, watto just likes direct damage, and thatâ€™s the fact.</p>

<p>i decided to start with â€œbad feeling have iâ€ cause EPPâ€™s will kill my watto and this really sucks,donâ€™t forget to</p>

<p>pull out as the fisrt action â€œThere Is No Tryâ€, so you are a litlle bit protect from â€œalterâ€.i always try to flip watto</p>

<p>the first turn, the best way to flip watto for zero force is in combo with â€œTelevan Koreyyâ€, this small guy just rulez</p>

<p>then i try to get out my jabbaâ€™s palace with â€œNeimoidian Advisorâ€ this card is tech, with the audience chamber, holotable and the bridge</p>

<p>the force activation â€œmustâ€ be enough for watto, give direct damage with â€œSearch &amp; Destroyâ€,â€Wattoâ€ and â€œFirst Strikeâ€.</p>

<p>i put in also a tatooine maul for the space, maul in ship is a biest, just a QMC Killer, with watto iâ€™am also able to pull</p>

<p>out the Executur and maul in ship, this is always enough for space, cause watto will never drain high he will kick</p>

<p>a.sses in battle or give his loven DIRECT DAMAGE. so try protect watto and the gane is a auto win donâ€™t deploy to fast</p>

<p>your big mains, (except palpy with janus) keep maul with stick and EPP Vader for the importnat battle againt qui etc. â€¦.</p>

<p>this was the main strat nothing amazing new, but it still works and works and works â€¦â€¦</p>

<p>Why Colo Claw Fish?</p>

<p>i think this card must be in every dark deck (ok if opponent plays starting for light side itâ€™s junk, but otherwise?)</p>

<p>with colo claw fish youâ€™ll be able to kill mains like qui,ben or luke easily itâ€™s a better feelign if you battle and you see</p>

<p>there is a dest of 6 on the fish so think about it ?</p>

<p>Why Unsalvageable ?</p>

<p>this card is tech, it keeps you watto â€œaliveâ€ and it will help your Executor against Power Pivot or something else and itâ€™s</p>

<p>a nice dest of 5 and the best thing itâ€™s used interrupt</p>

<p>so the rest of my deck is normal (i think, or?), maybe put in one more â€œChance Cubeâ€ sometimes it will help you if you keep</p>

<p>this interrupt in hand for battles @ wattoâ€™s junkyard.</p>

<p>thx all for reading/rating my deck, and please write helpfull critic or some new awesome ideas</p>
