I"j<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">here we are in milwaukee, and i am playtesting for the last
<br />
time before the qualifier and you know what my deck sucks so 
<br />
in desperation i turn to my good buddy yannick and he shows me
<br />
is light side ,witch after i see him play against gary, decide
<br />
to build a similiar one minus a few card of is deck and for my 
<br />
dark side well gary just looks at it well show me the error 
<br />
i was doing when playing it and made me change a few card 
<br />
that help a lot.
<br />
<br />
so my light side was: mind what you have learned( direct damage)
<br />
and dark side was: bring him before me.
<br />
<br />
now on to the tournament 
<br />
day 1
<br />
<br />
well for day1 i didn't keep track of my opponent i know i played
<br />
great player such as martin raveling, jim li, todd rowe and others
<br />
but in the end of a 8 match tournament i standed undefeated
<br />
at 8-0 + 132. Wich is my very best EVER, now i am qualified 
<br />
what a relief.
<br />
<br />
day 2 annouce to be a lot more tougher than yesterday we are 
<br />
about 50 and you can see only top player are here. on to the tournament.
<br />
<br />
my light side vs eric hunter rop's
<br />
<br />
Well i played against 1 ralltir ops before this match and i won but eric is
<br />
a mutch better player than the other guys. But with afa and my 2 
<br />
presence of the skywalker on table + uncontrolled fury are just enough 
<br />
to give me the win.
<br />
FW 2(+6)
<br />
<br />
dark vs todd rowe 
<br />
i think if i remember correctly he started only rendez-vous point 
<br />
and 3 effect no hidden base so thats a relief well basicly 
<br />
i set up search and destro by turn 3 with vader at a spaceport
<br />
docking bay and mara + emperor at the endor docking bay.
<br />
FW 4(+26)
<br />
<br />
light vs ray bordier bring him
<br />
Now ray is a very good player and i must say that it is fun to play 
<br />
against him. In this game ray made one heck of a masterfull move 
<br />
i gave him luke to vader on his turn he moves vader to the docking 
<br />
bay and at the beggining of is control phase he rise my friend vader
<br />
and frees luke now at this point i am thinking he fears a beatdown 
<br />
since i got 10 card in hand + 10 card already activated, so on my turn
<br />
i do like everybody and drain he play lost in the wilderness
<br />
and the only thing i can do is watch my luke go missing. basicly 
<br />
after that vader came with a bunch on people made me lose 3 
<br />
to your destiny and he won
<br />
FL 4(+2)
<br />
<br />
dark vs geoff snider profit 
<br />
i dont really remember this game but i know that search and destroy 
<br />
was set up quickly and we battle it out on tatooine.
<br />
FW 6(+20)
<br />
<br />
now at that point i am 3-1 and this good because i am at the
<br />
4th table.
<br />
<br />
light vs hayes hunter bring him
<br />
hayes is a very good player we start of like usual for a few turn tough 
<br />
hayes only draws and like on the 4th turn all at once deploys
<br />
cc : downtown plaza, presence of the force, vader, is lightsaber
<br />
and some scrub. this is not good i only have obi-wan with lightsaber in hand
<br />
so i gave luke to vader drew and played it could be worst when i had it
<br />
now at that point i only got one afa and already lost 1st test 
<br />
ok i am in trouble so i finaly send obi with leia and manage to clear 
<br />
the site after a couple of turn but hayes just comes back with 
<br />
tatooine cantina, vader, mara and their lightsaber and that was just 
<br />
enough to give him the win.
<br />
FL 6(+4)
<br />
<br />
dark versus erick peterson
<br />
he starts yoda's hut + 3 effect and thats ok by me. so i 
<br />
start setting search and destroy but he decide to come and see
<br />
me with ben kenobi (deployed at tatooine docking bay) and 2 scrub 
<br />
ok next turn vader and his lightsaber comes to is site circle 
<br />
ben slash one of the 2 scrub and he lost some force to that +
<br />
search was completed and that basicly ended the game.
<br />
FW 8(+26)
<br />
<br />
so in the end my dark side never lost i went 12-2 at gencon 
<br />
got a lot of rating since i am at 1776 of rating and finish 
<br />
9th in day 2 i would say i had a good week-end. well i am 
<br />
sure to see every one a deciphercon and sorry if i made 
<br />
mistake with the grammar.   </font></td>
