<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Like Most Other Hunt Down Podracing Decks the opponent loses force from podracing, epic duel, counter assaults, visage of the emperor and draining.</p>

<p>ASAP you need to get the holotable and start draining there and then going off dueling with vader and maul.</p>

<p>With The new effects from Coruscant-They Will Be No Match For You and The Phantom Menace are excellent making maul immune to attrition and dueling with him and NOT placing Hunt Down Out Of Play.</p>

<p>The Starships are in there for taking over opponents location or catching them off guard if they think you don`t have any space.</p>

<p>The Force from visage won`t really hurt you because you can retrieve it with podracing.</p>

<p>Against WYS and QMC Start Draing at the holotable, win the podrace and duel the jedi.</p>

<p>Play Counter Assault with their lower power characters and make them lose loads of force.</p>

<p>Against HB all space Drain away at the holotable and any location with Maul and Vader. Their loss from visage and podracer will win the game for you. â€˜</p>
