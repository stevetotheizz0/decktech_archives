<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Ok basically every game hereâ€™s your start</p>

<p>Prepared Defenses, IAO, Mob. Points, Oppressive, Your Insight, Insignificant Rebellion, DS 2 Throne Room and of course the objective.</p>

<p>Basically deploy to get a drain going, when they either deploy to stop the drain or deploy elsewhere to match it beat them up with multiple destinies, imperial commands, emperors power etc.  First Strike and Insignificant Rebellion speed this up.  Donâ€™t get Luke unless you can apply beatdown fast or if heâ€™s draining you bad because you will lose one force a turn and the destinies are relatively low in the deck so you most likely wonâ€™t be making them lose force to the duels.</p>

<p>Basically the strat section is the same for every deck</p>

<p>CONTROL SPACE, this is the biggest thing Dark has going for it right now and one of the keys of winning every game.  Wanna beat WYS?  Get the system early and keep it.</p>

<p>WYS</p>

<p>Control the system, get them to stack cards.  Grab Harvest  Set up decree if possible to shut down the drains.  Out drain them and just beat them to oblivion with Imperial command.</p>

<p>EBO</p>

<p>Beat them up with search destroy and battle plan.  Set up decree with hoth sites or planets, whichever works better.  Start decree instead of oppressive for this matchup since there isnâ€™t anything really worth grabbing.</p>

<p>Hidden Base Flip</p>

<p>Probe the hell out of them.  Basically same strategy as EBO just you must probe the system.  Probing the system increases your chances of winning exponentially, not that it is hard anyways.</p>

<p>Mains</p>

<p>Play smart, thatâ€™s how you beat mains.  Play smart, I canâ€™t tell you how to beat mains you just gotta do it.</p>

<p>Hope you like the deck</p>
