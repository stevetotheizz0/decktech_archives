I"d<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I wanted to write a tournament report again for the heck of
<br />
it and was going to write about Saturday’s (10/14) tourney
<br />
in St. Cloud, MN, but I decided that I wanted to keep my
<br />
decks and my opponent’s decks as secret as possible until
<br />
after the Minnesota Grand Slam. So, instead, I decided to 
<br />
write about the Tuesday night tourney at Mirkwood Coffee &amp;
<br />
Comics.
<br />
<br />
We play a tournament at Mirkwood every week, and I found out
<br />
that I could only play the same (and against the same) silly
<br />
purple cards for so long before I needed a break. My Dark 
<br />
Side decks, especially, had seen so little variety (BHBM &amp;
<br />
Hunt Down) that I needed to completely rethink the whole
<br />
process. Meanwhile, I had *finally* managed the week before
<br />
to regain possession of a Dantoine Base Operations card
<br />
which I had really wanted to play since Death Star II had
<br />
brought out Menace Fades. I figured I could play DBO a lot
<br />
like RalOps. So I built a DBO deck and decided to play an
<br />
Old Skool Jabba’s Palace manipulator complete with Mi’yoom
<br />
(yuck), Scanning Crews (yuck, yuck), Dangerous Times (yuck,
<br />
yuck, yuck) and only two Death Star II cards: Lord Vader &amp;
<br />
the Chimaera.
<br />
<br />
We had some mid-teens number of players. Chad Steger wrote a
<br />
report about the same tournament and might have had more
<br />
general information.
<br />
<br />
Game 1: My DBO vs (sorry, forgot his name) Random Tie Stuff
<br />
This kid seems like a nice guy and just recently started
<br />
showing up for tourneys with his brother. Between the two of
<br />
them, they seem to have each specialized in one side of the 
<br />
force, borrowing the other brother’s left-overs to play
<br />
their weak side. He played his brother’s random left-overs
<br />
against me. Which was okay with me since my DBO was fairly
<br />
weak. He started Meditation Chamber... and that was it. So I
<br />
had no clue and started with my usual Signal and Goo Nee Tay
<br />
to kill deployment at Dantooine. I can’t remember much
<br />
about the game other than that we both deployed sites and 
<br />
drew for a few turns until he left a Dreadnaught on its own.
<br />
The Falcon came down and was soon Legendary, and that was
<br />
about all that was needed. Can’t remember what else I deployed
<br />
or why...
<br />
FW 2(+33)
<br />
<br />
Game 2: My Old Skool Manipulator vs Garret Larson HB B-wings
<br />
Hmm... Well, Garret had expressed many times in the past how
<br />
he hates manipulation (and frequently starts Scrambled
<br />
Transmission just to kill it), so since he’s a bit larger
<br />
than me, I tried to make him promise not to beat me up after
<br />
the game (he didn’t promise). When we sit down to start, I 
<br />
say the only Style Points I might get for this game are
<br />
Old Skool points, and when I reveal Jabba’s Palace and 
<br />
Expand the Empire, we both agree that I got those. Then I 
<br />
proceed to Scanning Crew and Monnok and do crap to him and
<br />
force drain with Gailid (pulled him with Audience Chamber
<br />
since Garret had no characters in his hand) and Dangerous
<br />
Times so that his B-wings, Surprise Assaults, Intruder 
<br />
Missiles and stuff are all clumped into doubles, and
<br />
Monnok comes back to chew up cards. Vader and his Saber add
<br />
to my drain and back up Gailid, and Garret later reveals
<br />
that he didn’t have enough systems in his deck to flip,
<br />
having constructed the deck in a hurry and forgotten one
<br />
of his usual systems. Nonetheless, I’ve been holding a
<br />
bunch of cards in my hand and have taken a few drains of 2
<br />
or 3, not wanting to put a ship down against his B-wings
<br />
until I was safe from the Missile / Power Pivot combo.
<br />
FW 4(40-something)
<br />
<br />
Game 3: My DBO vs Herb Macy’s Endor Ops / Death Star Constr.
<br />
Herb plays this objective a lot, and I’ve seen it most
<br />
frequently (and recently) with high-ability guys like Vader,
<br />
the Emperor, Janus, Sim Aloo and such. So I start Goo Nee
<br />
Tay, and it turns out this is some variant of his deck that
<br />
plays a lot of 2-ability pilots and matching ships. This
<br />
was a fairly ugly game for a dispute in the middle, but at
<br />
some point, I flipped to reduce his drains. He got his Death
<br />
Star constructed and was getting me for 2 with that and 1 at
<br />
Endor. I had a hell of a time getting a ship and finally
<br />
drew the Tantive and started battling with that. At one
<br />
point, I battled against some stuff at the system the 
<br />
Death Star was orbiting, and he shot my Tantive (I had 
<br />
forgotten about his Superlaser and That Thing’s Operational
<br />
- even though I was losing force to it)... so I lost it and
<br />
a couple pilots and Han to the Bacta Tank. Next turn, Han
<br />
came back out and got on the Falcon with Leia w/Blaster,
<br />
wrecked some ships of his (over the course of two turns, 
<br />
since I actually lost the first battle and had to wait on
<br />
Legendary) and got Legendary Starfighter out and Honor of
<br />
the Jedi (to stop his Death Star damage) and landed the 
<br />
Falcon at the Landing Platform (instead of facing 5 or 6 
<br />
Star Destroyers at Endor). He never deployed to Dantooine,
<br />
so I just drained there for one a turn, one at the Landing
<br />
Platform and Legendary for 2 each of his turns, while he 
<br />
was getting me for a grand total of 1 at Endor.
<br />
FW by 11.
<br />
6(+50-something, maybe 60... do you really care?)
<br />
<br />
Somehow it turned out that all the 2-1 players were on the 
<br />
same side of the force as me, so I ended up playing against
<br />
the top 1-2 player--Graham Neal. Graham Neal? He’s one of
<br />
the better players in our area. What was he doing at 1 and
<br />
2? It turned out he was playing SYCFA Ties without the 
<br />
Sienar Fleet Systems that Jim Li had borrowed...
<br />
<br />
Game 4: My Old Skool Manipulator against Graham’s EBO -
<br />
Baraguin.
<br />
<br />
I thought he would beat me because he would get EBO
<br />
out with non-unique aliens and drain with pilot &amp; ship
<br />
combos he would pull with Squadron Assignments. Instead,
<br />
I managed to set Gailid at the Audience Chamber first turn
<br />
(again no characters in his hand--well, apart from the two
<br />
Ishi-Tibs) and back him up shortly with Vader and his Saber.
<br />
Scanning Crews tore him apart. Dangerous Times and Monnok 
<br />
and Secret Plans (why weren’t more people playing with this
<br />
and Aim High at worlds?) made life hell for him, and I
<br />
pulled off the biggest win of my career. FW +41.
<br />
<br />
So, the whim that brought me back to Old Skool JP
<br />
Manipulator proved successful in the local meta (I was
<br />
lucky not to face Profit--it would have been a much more
<br />
difficult game), and I managed to successfully use DBO
<br />
before No Escape comes in and needlessly kills an already
<br />
challenged deck type.
