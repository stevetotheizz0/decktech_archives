<p>Objective (1)</p>

<p>You can Either Profit By this/ Or be Destroyed ‚Äò</p>

<p>Strategy: ‚Äò</p>

<p>Put Down An Unuseal amount of Fear with any Deffsive Sheilds you have. Use the Objective to get down Jabba‚Äôs Palace and Audience Chamber, With Han Frozen there.(a captive) Use Podrace Prep to put down Podrace Arena, Anakin‚Äôs Podracer,Boonta Eve Podrace and one of the fallowing effects A remote Plant,Goo Nay Tay, or No Disinagrations. the effect deployed will depend on the deck your opponent has.</p>

<p>First thing you do during your oppnents control phase, is start up a podrace. Snice most people don‚Äôt podrace they won‚Äôt have a podracer in their deck. So it will be an easy win most likely in four to five turns. Your opponent will lose 6 forcew to make up you not being able to force drain at Tatooine Locations. The six you gaain back should leave you with only one card lost if any.</p>

<p>Always leave yourself with at lest two cards to pull up each turn. Untill you get Leia, Rebel Princess in your hand along with Someone Who Loves You. Put Leia at Audience Chamber Free Han with Someone Who Loves you Then If Opponent Has people there move them away at the end of your turn.</p>

<p>Then Just sit back and make your Opponent lose force. Makeing kessel runs as needed. To regain eight force. going from Coruscant to Kessel and Back. Use the Outrider with Dash and Leebo piloting. so as opponent loses one force for you completeing the run. Note you will need the help of A Few Manvers to make the run.</p>

<p>Also Know that it‚Äôs best not to battle with this deck.  ‚Äò</p>
