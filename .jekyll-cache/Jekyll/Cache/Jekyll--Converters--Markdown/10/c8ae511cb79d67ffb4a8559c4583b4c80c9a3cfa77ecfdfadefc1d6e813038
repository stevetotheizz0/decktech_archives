<p>Strategy: ‚Äò</p>

<p>this deck sets up like a well organized drug bust.</p>

<p>on the first turn (force impending)I pull</p>

<p>(and deploy) crix, who pulls his CoK who pulls</p>

<p>wuta who pulls a site i can also pull back door and</p>

<p>bunker (i get a force because TSID). If i have enough force which is xtremely doughtful I pull genaral calrissian who pulls GS1. Anyways Even if I dont do all those steps I will still have plenty of</p>

<p>activation on turn 2 where I pull more sites</p>

<p>and scouts. by turn 3 or 4 I will be set up for</p>

<p>flip when I flip I send scouts into bunker and use the +4EE bonus and a charge to blow it away. If</p>

<p>the druggy¬ís come to the bunker i¬íll blow them</p>

<p>straight to hell with concussion gernade or a charge.once I clean out the bunker I spread out in my grace turn (they have no hand) and drain. the game should be quick after that because of the force swing and O.K.  drains at Endor. this deck isn¬ít a battling powerhouse on ground or space but i have good enough forces to maintain what i need to of both places (8 destiny 6and7s help).</p>

<p>Why 3 different AO¬ís? even people on crack can</p>

<p>see that lots of AO¬ís R compatible w/scouts   concentate all fire=scouts immune &lt;6 better</p>
