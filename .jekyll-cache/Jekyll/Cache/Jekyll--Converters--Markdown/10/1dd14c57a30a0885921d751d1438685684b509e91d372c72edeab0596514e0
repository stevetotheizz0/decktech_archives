<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Start out with the starting stuff (of course). Twiâ€™lek for Bad Feeling Have I or another effect of your choice. Get Vader out as soon as possible at one of the very few sites I have in (I need to add more). Open a can with the other cards you have in. This is basically it, just remember to have them lose for Visage. HoloNet is in for Transmission Terminated. I got Tortures in for Odds. IAO if theyâ€™re main hoppers and Bad Feeling for mains also, donâ€™t forget about most of their mains being +2. If Hidden Base is what theyâ€™re playing then probe with the ships and drain them out on the ground. I probably need to toss in a Ghhhk. You might want to slip in Crush The Rebellion and an Evader or two for those few Revo decks still runninâ€™ â€˜round. This is basically it, this deck stands up surprisingly well against about any variety of decks. I like it and thinks it kicks ass.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reviews guys.</p>

<p>the tall guy Iâ€™ve been planning on adding another Visage maybe 2. Cause a destiny 7 never hurt anyone.</p>

<p>redawg77 That is a really good idea. I will put one in as soon as I get one.</p>

<p>Annihilator Well Ben, all I have to say to you is donâ€™t build such good decks for Reid next time. =)</p>

<p>morbius 18 Youâ€™re right about the Zuckuss in Mist Hunter, as soon as I get some EJP Iâ€™ll pop it in.</p>
