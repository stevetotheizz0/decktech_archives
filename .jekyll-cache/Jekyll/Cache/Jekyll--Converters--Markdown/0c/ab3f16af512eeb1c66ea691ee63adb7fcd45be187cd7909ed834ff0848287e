I"$<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Yo, what’s up?  How do you like my TR so far?   I just finished reading "hayes hunter speaks out" so my title is a pun on my good buddy hayes’ newfound celebrity status.  So anyway, i’m typing this report in between classes and have only 30 minutes to write it so it wont be edited and it will prolly be pretty sloppy...so it will be like all my other trs.
<br />
<br />
So it’s a local so no pre tourny garbage...it is the fist local in mass held while hayes is away, so it is kind of a proving ground for the next great player to take hayes’ place in mass.  My budyy mike gemme calls me numerous times during the week to talk about cards, but i am really not into it and just decide to play the same decks i played at ramapo with like 4 cards diff from my dark deck(hunt down jizz) and one diff from my light(wys solid).
<br />
The notables who are there:
<br />
-mike gemme
<br />
-eric hunter
<br />
-my boys aka the numbs
<br />
-paul moholick
<br />
-steve brentson
<br />
<br />
So i get to the store with my boys pretty early and there is this guy there who talks to us about pot for like 20 minutes without stoping even to take a breath of air and ben numb the whole time pretends that he’s interested and is like, "i totaly hear that" and "thats cool, tell me more."  Anyway mike gemme eventually comes in his teched out car and the tourny starts pretty soon after that.
<br />
<br />
Game one - my light vs. some local kid’s senate mains...
<br />
well i get strike force in my opeing hand so i automatically win.  I set up 2nd turn with teh following:
<br />
dash at kesel
<br />
mirax at tatooine
<br />
luke with saber at a docking bay
<br />
melas at the cantina
<br />
philo at his docking bay
<br />
I’ll tale teh leader
<br />
<br />
...so i’m draing for 13...he’s not doing anything...he fights me late game but that doesn’t work for him.
<br />
Full win by 27
<br />
<br />
Highs--neh
<br />
Lows--neh
<br />
<br />
Mike gemme plays ten numb and wins, brentson loses...ben beat vegas.
<br />
eric wins by a bunch.
<br />
<br />
Game 2...my dark vs. Mike schiemers Hidden mains
<br />
Mike used to be 2000 and is still a damn good player.  He just got assed by tatooine and coruscant and cant make decks anymore.
<br />
I get my podrace set up and win it...vader comes down.  Very interactive game that goes like this:
<br />
I put vader down.
<br />
He kills him with an epp
<br />
I put vader down again
<br />
He puts anothe repp down and kills him...this goes on for like 4 turns in a row but visage is hrting us both and he runs out of epps before i run out of vaders.
<br />
Full win my 11.
<br />
<br />
Highs-very fun game
<br />
Lows-nada
<br />
<br />
gane three i play steve celluchi who is an upcomong player in our region.
<br />
<br />
My wys vs his hoth...yeah its an auto win.
<br />
I start dont do that again and set up in space and beat him in every battle we have and contro space...legendary comes out.
<br />
He never gets set up so he loses...I win by 27
<br />
Highs-neh...lando drained in the cantina the whole game
<br />
Lows-...neh
<br />
<br />
Game four i play the man, mike gemme.
<br />
My huntodwn jizz vs his wys solid.
<br />
well he beat me in this matchup pre coruscant but huntdown jizz is alot better now so i know i have a chance.  i start snatch instead of the box and it wins me the game.
<br />
He drops the non unique db first turn and i have noescape so i get vaders and maul in ship down 2nd turn...i put so much pressure on him so early that he is @#$%ed.  maul inspace at atatooine...vader with saber at teh db and visage.  Palp comes out late with janus too.  he wins the race but cant retrieve because of secret plans...no edges because no han or luke.  Full win by 9.
<br />
<br />
Highs-playing gemme
<br />
lows-beating gemme
<br />
<br />
afterwards we go to wendys and eat food.  End of story.
<br />
<br />
game five...my wys vs eric hunters wys killa (watto )
<br />
well he starts watto with 3 effects and flips first turn and i lose 2 interupts from hand...i have no characters in my opeing hand so i have to draw...i give him to drain of one(i start battle plan but he still pays 3 to drain for 1 all game long).
<br />
I set up space but late cuz of my slow start...i get legendary off and the kessel drain but he just got a wicked fast start and i can never go to ground cuz he just kills my dudes with tramples.  Full loss by 9
<br />
Highs--good game
<br />
Lows--bad luck
<br />
<br />
well i’m 4-1, gemme is 4-1, eric is 4-1...
<br />
<br />
I play ric gaudioso .
<br />
<br />
My jizz his wys solid...
<br />
<br />
well he starts normal wys stuff but i win the race in 3 turns and limited resources and visage and cantina drain end this game in 10 minutes.  He gets luke out late and we both lose to visage but its still too late for him to pull out teh win.  Full win by 19.
<br />
<br />
Eric beats mike because mike leaves 2 cards in his deck box(i’m pretty sure miek woulda won the game if he had been able to pull of the race).  But its all good.  Eric win s the tourny by 6 diff oever me.  All in al a good tourny--top 3 are
<br />
eric hunter
<br />
justin desai
<br />
mike gemme
<br />
<br />
the new top 3 players in kashyyyk.
<br />
<br />
Afetr the tourny we hang around...ten numb goes 4-2 which is ill and fun is had by all.  A very fun local.
<br />
