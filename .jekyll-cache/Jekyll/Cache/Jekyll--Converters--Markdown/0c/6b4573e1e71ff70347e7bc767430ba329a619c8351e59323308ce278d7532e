<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>You should know how Throne Room mains work by now. If not, go look at someone else’s strategy or go look at my long-winded strat section in version 1.0.</p>

<p>A couple of comments</p>

<p>1)Yes, I know I have low duel protection and no numbers protection. This is a meta decision, I’m the only one around here gutsy enough to duel and nobody who’s any good thinks about messing with DS numbers.</p>

<p>2)Yes, I know, there’s 4 Hans in here. Yes, it sounds extreme, but so far I’ve found that it works very efficiently, especially with a Savrip out to toss spares to.</p>

<p>Tracked 5 destiny + Tawss Khaa + Bacta Tank = Best combo in the deck, hands down. Just had to say it.</p>

<p>Anyway, going over the changes from version 1.0.</p>

<p>1) Replaced CCLower Corridor with Kashyyyk. It’s a decision that helps a lot against Ralltiir, and I saw no big reason why I should just throw more force their way. I’ve got the Yavin 4 generics to drain at, if it must be.</p>

<p>2) Took out a Nabrun for Uncontrollable Fury. With the popularity of IAO, 2 Nabruns didn’t seem necessary, and conversely, Fury can do some major damage if they can’t teleport Vader over to a fight. Plus, it’s Vader/Tarkin killer, which I had felt uncomfortable about since there’s no Smoke Screens.</p>

<p>3) Replaced Gift Of The Mentor with Don’t Get Cocky. I found in playtesting that Luke and Obi would often not be together to use GiTM, and the saber search function doesn’t matter too much in here with EPPs galore. I envisioned Luke as an emergency pilot w/Han on the Falcon in place of Leia, and also Luke and Han being a strike force on the ground. This change proved itself when I used DNC to kill Tempest 1 and a pilot towards the end of a game against RallOps.</p>

<p>I’ve thought about adding another Tranmission Terminated, Draw Their Fire, cool stuff like that. Feel free to advise, obviously.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking a look, and a final comment</p>

<p>Do not rate this deck solely on originality. Somebody gave version 1.0 a three star rating, the only comment being ‘It’s just not original’. I could’ve told you that one. The cool thing is about being unoriginal is that if you can play the deck well enough, the originality of the deck matters extremely little. Plus, it’s my own spin on a very popular decktype. It’s fun and it’s powerful, it works for me. Already won a tournament. ‘</p>
