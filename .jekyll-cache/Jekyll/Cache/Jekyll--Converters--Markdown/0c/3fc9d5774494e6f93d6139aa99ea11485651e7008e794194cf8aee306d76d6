I"@'<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Back at ya another time, with a report this week from Modesto, at Kriers Cards and Comics, and I’ll follow this one up with the tourney the following day at Pleasonton....TR begins NOW.....
<br />
<br />
<br />
Prelude
<br />
<br />
I was planning on holding a tournament myself this past Sunday, but something was nagging me in the back, telling me it wouldnt sanction, so I held a poll and after all the whining and complaining I endured, I decided to cancel my tournament and get some tourney action in myself instead. 
<br />
<br />
Once again I talk to Steve Daniel and I get myself the ride I need to head down to Modesto. The new store for Modesto tourneys didnt look bad, alot better than the Gauntlet though the Gauntlet had more room, this place was alot nicer. We get a nice turnout with 29 people, and were doing 6 games to make it one hell of a tourney.
<br />
<br />
I decided I needed a break from Throne Room, its lost at least one of my games every tournament, plus it was getting a little tedious looking for Nudjs all the time, so I made a version of Stimmed Jim’s EBO and decided to try it. DS had to be BHBM......24-0 and still red hot, I couldnt find the heart to make another DS. Pairings announced and its GAME TIME.
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Game
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1: LS EBO Smackdown Hotel vs. Some Jabroni’s DS Starter Deck
<br />
<br />
This game was over in about 10 minutes. I play this new player who learned the game only a week ago. All he has is a DS DS2 Starter and a few cards from prize support, and my EBO wrecks it. I set up EBO while he sits on Hoth but forgets to drain all game. I get out Super Falcon and sit at Kiffex for 4 a turn. He drops ships to Hoth and I drop OTE and slide over to Hoth. He drops a few TIEs and battles, a Punch It! later, I win the battle and wipe out about 10 ships. He has no more answers, and thats game.......It really was that damn quick. Win by 34.
<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 2(+34)
<br />
Highs: Starting strong
<br />
Lows: Smashing a scrub
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2: DS BHBM vs. IDMWYNI’s LS Profit Smasher
<br />
<br />
I forgot his name, I think it was Chris, but Im not too sure. I start off with Mara to the AC, but I manage to get screwed with both Emppys in my opening hand. He still comes down 1st turn to the AC, followed by Maras stick the next turn and both move out for the drains.  He sits back and draws for a few, eating my drains. I drop DLOTS to the AC and Blizzard 2 and Veers to JP, hitting him for 4 a turn and making him fight for Han. He does nothing for awhile, but eventually decides to take over Rendili with Wedge for a drain of 1 a turn. He hands Luke to Vader, but that doesnt mean much. He tries to smack Veers but draws below my immunity, I draw double destiny thanks to Command, and kill off a few people. He has no answers until I decide Vader needs to be outside with Veers and leave the AC open. He comes in with Leia and frees Han, I pick up Vader via Rise, My Friend and smack them. He tries to come back by hiding Han at Obis Hut, but I kill off all the other Profit guys, and he cant come back with no drains. Win by 18.
<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 4(+52)
<br />
Highs: Winning past another one, 25-0 now
<br />
Lows: Nothing too much
<br />
<br />
<br />
Clayton Atkin decides to show up after the first game and he joins the fun after borrowing and switching off some of Paul Feldmans decks. Steve, Kyle Ishimaru and myself head to Subway for some much needed munchies. I converse with Carl Hardy and theyre into the new WWF Raw Deal CCG, something Ive been meaning to check out. I head back and finish my footlong, and pick up the Triple H(no need to be a marky mark just yet) starter as Game 3 begins. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3: LS EBO Smackdown Hotel vs. Jeff Fields DS SYCFA Interceptors
<br />
<br />
Jeff and Kevin Shannon are late coming back for the 3rd game due to them getting some food for Feldman. Jeff starts off drawing for systems and setting up Lord Vader at the Dbay to activate. I set up EBO, but it takes some time because I cant find my aliens. He sets up a Dread, Merrejk and an Interceptor to Kashyyk. I respond with the Super Falcon and battle, draw two 5’s and a 7 to clean house. He reponds with a few TIEs and we duke it out, he forgets to play All Powers and loses about 8 TIEs because of that. I get Legendary out, and now hes struggling to kill the Falcon. I get OTE out and he runs with Bossk, eventually getting sick of it, drops a load of TIEs, laterals and battles. I Punch It! and get mad power regardless, and he cant find an answer to the Falcon. I battle him the next turn, play I Know and wipe out every TIE there and then some. Legend and OTE are nagging at him, and he cant off the Falcon, my drains add up, and thats it.  Win by 21.
<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 6(+73)
<br />
Highs: Giving TIEs the beatdown they so heartily deserve......playing Jeff
<br />
Lows: Nothing much
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4: DS BHBM vs. The Golden Girls LS MWYHL Landing Claw Hell
<br />
<br />
Or as I like to refer to it, where my BHBM runs out of steam. I start looking for my Dbays, and find the generic one, but no Endor one.......I just realized I removed it for a Vaders saber(why? I dont know)....so Honor will work this game all game unless I can Alter it. This complicates things. She gives Luke to me late, losing a few to Your Destiny, eventually i get every back to the TR and duel for 3 a turn. She gets Honor out late, and blazes past her tests. I cant respond to anything, and she Landing Claws my Rendili drain, and Projections my Dbay drain. Im praying for a miracle, it never comes......she finishes Test 5 and retrieves a junkload thanks to On the Edges. The only thing hurting her is my AO and General Veers on Rendili, and I lose 1 to my objective evey turn. She comes to battle me in space, but I wipe out her fleet. She retrieves Home One and drops to Kessel to finish me off.......all thanks to that last BG I TOOK OUT......Loss by 13.
<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 6(+60)
<br />
Highs: Playing a good game....
<br />
Lows; I love how my brain goes on TUMORS and screws me like this......and my DS has finally suffered a loss......
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 5: LS EBO Smackdown Hotel vs. Kevin Shannons DS HDADTJ Speed
<br />
<br />
My brain took a vacation this game......I was totally out of it. He sets up Vader to Endor w/ stick 2nd turn, amazing speed for Hunt Down. I set up EBO 3rd turn, losing constantly to his drains and Visage. I drop Squassin and show ARTOO TO LOOK FOR LUKE......I dont know where that came from. He lets me take it back to do another action(retrieve a cannon with Baragwin), but I forget what the action was and take not only Luke, but JEDI LUKE to space. Now not only can I not drain, I have to deploy them to Kiffex(the only system out) and manage to land Luke on Hoth and sit and wait for him to get me. I eventually get Falcon to Kiffex and start draining, but by now he has Emporer, Vader, and Mara spread across 3 Endor sites with Overseeing It out, and Im taking 12 a turn plus Visage to my 4 towards him. I cant make a comeback when youre draining more than EBO, and he drains me out by far. Loss by 28.
<br />
<br />
Cumalative Score: 6(+32)
<br />
Highs: Nothing much
<br />
Lows: Did you read the game?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 6: DS BHBM vs. Thomas’s Undercover Profit Hell
<br />
<br />
Im feeling kinda tired and demoralized after Kevin wiped me all over Modesto, so I just want to end this ASAP and get prizes and head off. Mara starts to his Objective, first turn for her saber and Emporer to JP for the trap and a drian of 3. He drops a spy to Emporer and I cant find a walker or Tramples for the life of me. I drop the Spaceport Dbay to Tatooine, but he’s got spies there as well. He heads to my Throne Room and I send DLOTS in to handle them. Obi misses Vader with his saber across about 6 battle between the 2, due to low destinies on our part. I eventually kill Obi thanks to Janus, and I proceed to move to Tatooine. He frees Han with Leia late game, and he cant retailiate, as I pick Vader up and off the both of them. He eventually gets EPP Han to Tatooine and hides at the Hut, but by now, Ive fried and Trampled the spies and am draining for hell to his Profit damage. He cant find any answers from Luke, so he just gives. Win by 23.
<br />
<br />
Final Score: 8(+55)
<br />
Highs: Finishing strong, despite my migrane headache and a dry throat
<br />
Lows: Pretty much the last 2 games, and my DS losing its first loss. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Results
<br />
<br />
I get screwed once again in prize support, getting nothing of value and more trash to throw to scrubs. Steve pulls his fourth Lord Vader, so he’s happy. I end up 7th place, right behind Kevin Shannon. Paul Feldman took this tourney, proving he still has some juice left before Worlds. At this point, I can barely move, but luckily Steve hooks it up with some Twix and I get some sugar to last me to Kevins house.
<br />
<br />
We stay for awhile until the store closes, as me and Steve learn how to play Raw Deal(He picked up Austin’s starter). After a quick analysis of the rulebook, we played a few and Triple H smashes Austin 4 games in a row.......maybe he is just that damn good. We cant find packs of it there, so we head to Kevin Shannon’s for the evening, for food and some ZZZ’s before Pleasonton the following morning. 
<br />
<br />
I’ll hit you again with the Pleasonton report soon, watch for that......
