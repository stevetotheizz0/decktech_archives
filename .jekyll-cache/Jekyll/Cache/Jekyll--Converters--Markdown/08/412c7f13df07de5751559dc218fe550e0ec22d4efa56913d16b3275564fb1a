<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>This deck was made to counter the Mains decks out there wich pack 2 Shocking Infoâ€™s and consider that Manipulation defense.</p>

<p>Start with Tatooine, and Combat Readiness to pull Tat JP (usually).  First turn pull the AC (duh).  Hereâ€™s the basic strategy</p>

<p>vs.  Mains - Grab their Shockers (or Voyeur them if you donâ€™t have a grabber).  Use Frustration to take out their Grabbers.  Scan away their mains, and get Occupation going.	You should always know whatâ€™s in their hand, so group your guys if they have a beatdown crew assembled.</p>

<p>vs.  Anything that starts Yarna (HBX, Speeder/Ops, Ewoks, whatever)  - pull an ability 4 guy, and Alter Yarna.	Shouldnâ€™t be too hard with the destiny in this deck.  After that, Scan to find out when you can kill them with Monnok.</p>

<p>vs.  *.strom  -  Grab/Voyeur HDWGITM.  Monnok.	Scan.</p>

<p>vs.  Hidden Base non-swarm  -  Try to hold the system for Occupation.  Hopefully they are depending on Rebels for forfiet fodder.</p>

<p>This deck obviously has some weaknesses.  Hidden base w/o rebels or duplicates, for example.  I should probably add a Security Precautions, and Oppressive Enforcement wouldnâ€™t hurt either.  If the LS starts Wise Advice AND plays several Grimmys, that would also be very bad.</p>

<p>LMK what you think. â€˜</p>
