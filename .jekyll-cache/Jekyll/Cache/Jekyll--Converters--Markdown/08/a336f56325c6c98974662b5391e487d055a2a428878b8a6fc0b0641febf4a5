I"Ï<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The weekend came around and it looked like my choices were to go down to tournament in Cinci or bang my head against the wall all day in the dorm. So I get up early and get down to the Greyhound station. The bus gets me down to Cinci by about 10:30 and from there I take the local bus out to Acme Games in Mt Washington where the tourney was going to be. We start with 15, get up to 18 and finish with 17 people on the day. For light I was playing my Danger 2.0 WYS, a combination of a lot of different strats seen here on D-tech. For dark I was playing ISB space, shamelessly copied from what I could get from both Hunters with a couple mods of my own for lack of better cards. My rating going into this tourney was 1591 with a 3-1 from last week not in.
<br />
<br />
Game 1 vs Matt Rheudeâ€™s  (1502) WYS podracing
<br />
<br />
I start the usual IAO, MPoints and something else which didnâ€™t matter along with Sebulbaâ€™s pod. He starts podracing jank and Squassin. Not much really happend this game. I set up, but not finding an imp command, admiral piet or merrejek; draw ozzel and sullust for podracing before he damages me so i just stop stacking. He inserts AFA and puts Dash in the outrider at Kessel. Next turn I activate a ton along with some I had saved from before. AFA pops, so I drop Executor and Thrawn and Kessel, Lateral Damage on the Outrider to Corusant and proceed to beat the crap out of the Outrider for 15. Strangely he doesnâ€™t forfeit the Outrider or Dash. The rest of the game consits of me chasing Dash between Tat and Kessel while he filps for a little while. Then he forgets to move the Outrider so Thrawn lays beats again for the win. I never fliped ISB and we never finished the podrace.

<br />
Game 2 vs Wes Sutermeisterâ€™s (1574) Court podracing
<br />
<br />
I start Insurection, Squassin, and Insight while he gets Wattoâ€™s Box and we put podracers at the Arena. He drops Mighty Jabba and 4-Lom w/gun to the AC first turn. I ditch Insight for Honor and start setting up in space. He come up to space once at Kashyyyk against the Pulsar Skate with Mirax and an RFC with Fett in Jet, 2 destiny later The Skate is legendary and he never came back to space again. He won the podrace, but i take 2 damage off with Honor and now have a stack of high destiny to track. I just keep pouring on the damage, Falcon draining for 3 at Kessel, 2 at Kashyyyk, Jedi Knight Luke drains for 2 at the Tat DB. Then I take the AC with Lando w/gun, Chewie Protector and an RFC and that stack of high destiny. Next turn he comes for the beatdown with Lord Vader and Maul. Oops, no beatdown for you. The rest of the game consists of him draining with those 2 while I just keep making him hurt till he dies

<br />
Game 3 vs Michael Akridgeâ€™s (1543) SYCFA fliping Big Blue
<br />
<br />
I start Insurection, Squassin and Donâ€™t Do That Again vs his MPoins, Million Voices and Battle Order. The big play comes early as I put out Capn Han on the Falcon to Tat the 2nd turn. He responds with the Executor, the Star Destroyer AO and Capt Godheart . I get lucky and pop a 6 while he pulls a 1 so I just suck up the 4 damage. Next turn is probably what won me the game. I check my RD with Insurection, no DBâ€™s but I knew that and what I need is there so its all good. Squassin the Outrider for Dash, put an RFC on the Falcon. and battle. Reduce power of the big E by 6, Darklighter Spin  the Falcon for a 7 for my first destiny and then get like a 3, while he draws low, like a 1or 0. So he has to chose, either suck up the damage of at least 11 or just pitch the the ship. He pitches and the Falcon goes Legendary. Paply is camped at the D* Db so I donâ€™t think I want to go there. Rest of the game is the Jedi Knight camped out in the Tat DB again and and big space drains and fights as Star Destroyers are going down like a bad habbit. His retrival keeps him in the game for a long time till finally he has like 3 SD at Tat. I battle instead of running and making the Menace Fade. I canâ€™t quite kill him, so next turn I spit up and drain him some. He draws up soon thereafter.

Game 4 vs Michael Akridgeâ€™s RST bunker blowing
<br />
<br />
So we switch sides and do it again. I start the usual 2 plus i think Secret Plans. We set up etc etc, he gets the bunker blown on like the 4th turn, while I have the big E at Sullust draining away. Unfortunatly for me Chiranu hit the lost in the 8 from Bunker go boom. I convert his Endor, cruise on over, set up Battle Deployment and Vader+Tarkin and backup. Its just a drain race mainly, I get Arica at the Back Door to plug that drain. We battle some,  we both lose some retrivable scrubs. In the end my drains at Endor and later Sullust do the job. Just another day on the job for the ISB.

Game 5 vs Matt Scottâ€™s (1918)RST bunker blowing and podracing
<br />
<br />
I get a god hand this game. All 4 admirals in the opening hand. We race and i donâ€™t slow him down so i can set up with Piett/Merejek. I just put out as much good stuff as I can before he blow the Bunker. I get big E at Endor and Devastator at Sullust draining for 3 each thanks to Cherianu. That doestnt last long as Battle Plan comes out and most of my ground forces are gone. Arica gets the double agent treatment. Then Home One comes out with Ackabar and starts chasing the weaker parts of my fleet around. I drain for a lot but his mad damage hurts and he retrives most of his stuff. Eventually I cant pay for Battle Plan for all my drains and he keeps draining for free and using I did it and fliped RST to get stuff back.

Game 6 vs Matt Scottâ€™s SYCFA flipping Big Blue
<br />
<br />
Geez I make this whole long trip to this tourney and I play 3 different players and 4 different decktypes. Sheesh! Anyways he starts Million Voices,and I cant rember what the other two were. Anyway he flips on like the 3rd turn by just barely blowing away Alderann while I just started draining at Kessel with Capn Han and Lando with gun in the Falcon. Chimera pays a visit with Thrawn and the slugfest begins. This game is a big blur I knocked down lots of SDâ€™s and killing pilots, he kept retriving. I got most of my ships out, but couldnâ€™t adminster any huge beatdowns. It was just a waiting game and this time the Falcon didnâ€™t go legendary till late in the game That was probalby the difference as we ended up timing out. Iwas down by 4 in the end.
