My friend Lewis spent the night and we playtested pretty lightly.  It was the same matchups that weÂ’re used to.  After that we go and play Heroes 3 on the computer.  We watch the Sixers play the Lakers and go to bed.  We get up 8:30-ish and watch some cartoons.  For breakfast thereÂ’s frosted mini-wheats.  I check my e-mail for Patrick Hines, who needs to loan us some vital cards, and Brian Robinette, who Lewis and I are buying a booster box from.  We leave at 11, since the computer says it takes an hour to get there.  We get there at about 11:45.  Neither Patrick nor Brian are there yet, and the tourney starts at 12:30.  Lewis and I go to an Italian pizza place across the street, and get a medium thatÂ’s more like a large (size-wize, not price-wise).  And take it back to C&amp;B Cards and Comics.  By this time, its about 12:10 and Brian and Patrick are there.  We eat most of the pizza, then Brian tells us he left his Tatooine for us in the back of his truck back at PatrickÂ’s house.  Oh, well.  Patrick loans me the Hidden Base he said he would, and loans Lewis General Madine.  He also gives Lewis Great Shot Kid.  Lewis buys a LS Death Star he needs for his deck, and weÂ’re ready to start.  Overall, we have 14 people playing.

For LS, IÂ’m playing my awesome Hidden Base/ EBO deck I designed myself
<br />
For DS, IÂ’m running TIES with a SYCFA base.
<br />
My friend Lewis is running MBO and Walker Garrison.
<br />
The pairings are called, and I cringe.  My first opponent is Adam Weinstein, current state champ and beater of the likes of Stephen Lewis.
<br />
<br />
Game 1: LS vs.Adam WeinsteinÂ’s Hunt Down Podracing Odds (1817)
<br />
I start off with a fairly decent hand with Geezum and some other stuff.  I havenÂ’t read the podracer rules yet, so he lets me read the epic event.  I fin ) Tat I donÂ’t have to draw race destiny.  This is a good thing, because my deck is very card intensive.  On his first turn, he deploys the Emperor to the racetrack, then inserts odds.  I start setting up through what heÂ’s doing, and then I lose Hoth to Visage.  Damn.  Now I canÂ’t flip my objective, which means his drains will be killing me.  I get out Geezum and pull the shield generators on my third turn.  I figure he doesnÂ’t have anybody in there besides Vader, the Emperor, and Tech Mor.   He is able to get out Vader with the Emperor, and also gets out Mara to the 4th marker.  I have EBO set up by now with EPP Luke, Madine and Geezum.  Odds shows up at the top, so I have to lose 4.  He completes podracing with Selbulba, causing me to lose mucho force, while he retrieves.  I answer with a big drain of 15 on my turn.  I have all my characters beefed up at the docking bay, and after his drains I have 2 force left.  I think IÂ’ll get another huge drain in, but he has other plans.  He moves Mara to the DB and VaderÂ’s Obsessions Luke.  Oh well.  ThatÂ’s game.  I did draw 2 5s, but he got a 3,6, and 7.

The Good: Draining the state champ for 15 in one turn.
<br />
The Bad:  Hoth in the lost pile, Podracing, Odds.
<br />
The Ugly:  Luke for getting smacked around by a girl.
<br />
<br />
Lewis played the same type of deck I played, by the eventual winner of the tournament.  He was able to blow up the Death Star and only lost by 21
<br />
<br />
Game 2:  DS vs. Brian SpeightÂ’s Hidden Mains (1472)
<br />
Well, this game starts off slow.  He gets out the Tatooine DB and I Dark Waters it.  He deploys Dagobah and Courlaug with his objective.  I deploy Wakemulli and Sinear, but I canÂ’t find any of my systems.  I draw up a bunch and finally get a system-endor.  He deploys his Endor and draws.  I deploy my endor over his and deploy an interceptor with guns there.  I also get out Dreaded Imperial Starfleet and Return to Base.  I have about 6 force saved up, 3 for the guns and 3 for the EmperorÂ’s Shield.  He deploys the Home One there and battles.  I react with the squadron so I can get a destiny.  I draw high and forfiet the squadron to the R2B.  He moves the Home 1 to Dagobah.  On my turn, I get out more systems.  I spread and drain with little opposition.  There were only 2 more battles.  One turn, he deployed the Spiral with Han and Leia against my TIE but didnÂ’t battle.  I brought some forces upon him, the Vengeance, another TIE, and a Dreadnaught.  I also played APTW to help out.  He lost the system and some, while I lost the Dread to the R2B and lost the Vengeance.  In the final battle of the game, he deploys the Falcon with Han and Leia to Corlaug.  Again, he doesnÂ’t battle.  I activate carefully.  I use I CanÂ’t Shake Him to deploy the TIE cannons from my Reserve, deploy Fighter Cover, and battle.  I use Flawless Marksmanship to add 2 to my destiny, use 3 to fire, and draw a 5.  Battle over.  I drain him out.

Game 3:  DS vs. Devin CifersÂ’ WYS (1641)
<br />
In this matchup I was a little worried.  I hadnÂ’t really played that much WYS with my deck, and I had no protection against multiple destinies.  My only retrieval was Something Special Planned For Them.  I got a standard starting hand, though it also had SFS.  I pulled Wakemulli and deployed it, then drew up.  I now had in my hand Lateral Damage, a Black Squadron TIE and the Tallon Roll combo.  He deploys Corellia, then deploys the Falcon, Han, and Chewie.  Sweet.  I deploy the TIE to Corellia, Lateral Damage the Falcon, and then Tallon Roll.  He draws a 5, while I draw a 3.  His 5 to my 9.  I win.  The falcon is lost.  I draw up some more and get a few systems.  On his turn, he shows Mirax to pull the Skate, then deploys both and R2-D2 to his Kessel.  He also deploys a card that saves his butt many a time that game- HanÂ’s Toolkit.  It can cancel any interrupt or effect targeting the starship it is on.  No Lateral Damage, and no Relentless Pursuit.  IÂ’m glad IÂ’m running weapons.  On my turn, I deploy a TIE with cannons to Kessel and battle.  I use three to fire, and draw a 5.  His maneuver is 6, so it looks like itÂ’s lost.  However, he uses A Few Maneuvers to add 2 to the maneuver, and so I miss.  Damn.  He tells me heÂ’s running 4, so my weapons pretty much wonÂ’t work on him.  I donÂ’t lose too much to battle damage.  He gets some guys out to the Cantina and Docking Bay, even Qui-Gon.  I dark Waters the DB and deploy U-3PO to the Cantina.  During the rest of the game, I avoid the Pulsar Skate, and he makes about 3 Kessel Runs for 9 each, prolonging the game and lowering my differential.  I keep draining him for about 10 a turn, so eventually I win.

Game 4:  LS vs. Devin CifersÂ’ BHBM (1641)
<br />
As we started playing, he said something to the effect of Â“I hate Hidden Base because I donÂ’t have any space.Â”  I knew this was going to be a quick and easy game.  I start off with a system, an x-wing, and Luke in my starting hand, along with 2 hoth sites.  I pull Madine, activate, deploy a system, and draw up.  He gets out the Emperor (R2) to the D*2:DB and also pulls the tatooine DB.  On my turn, I pull the Echo DB, deploy Madine there, pull Geezum, pull the Main Power Generators, and deploy the 4th marker and another site from my hand.  I also deploy a system, then move Madine to the corridor.  On his turn, he deploys Jabba to the Tatooine DB, puts out the CC: DB, and deploys Mara, Guri, and Vader to the 4th Marker.  He moves the ladies to the 1st marker and draws.  On my turn, I deploy the War Room from Reserve, deploy Luke there, and deploy EBO.  I deploy the Tantive IV to Hoth, pull my last system, and flip.  I then shuttle up Geezum to the Tantive IV and move Luke to the DB and Madine to the Corridor.  I draw some, including Obi-Wan, and Signal for a Traffic Control.  On his turn, I lose 3 force to Your Destiny, and he drains me for some, which I cancel.  He deploys some more characters to the 4th marker and moves some of them over.  He  also moves Mara and Guri to the DB.  On my turn, I drain for 3.  I then continue by deploying an X-wing at each system.  I also deploy Obi-wan to the Echo DB and move Madine there.  I shuttle Luke up to the Tantive IV and draw a few.  On his turn, I have to lose 3 again to Your Destiny, then I cancel all his drains.  He deploys more stuff and moves in to try to cancel EBO, but heÂ’s not fast enough.  On my turn I drain him for 18 again, leaving him with only 6 cards in his reserve.  I also dump my hand.  On his turn he activates, drains, and draws up.

Well, with my score I end up getting 5th.  Lewis got 6th.  He blew up the death star again in the last game, but lost.  I got a pack of Cloud City and a pack of Tatooine.  Ther rares from them were You May Start Your Landing and LS Lando.  The winner, , got a box of Tatooine.  He pulled 2 Mauls and a bunch of other stuff.  Patrick decides to stay for a little while longer with somebody, so I load up Lewis and Brian in my car and drive to PatrickÂ’s house.  When we get there, Lewis and I pay Brian and he gives us the Booster Box he left in his truck.  I get a stack of packs, Lewis gets a stack of packs, and we divide the middle.  I pull regular and AI of Watto, Qui-Gon, and Obi-Wan.  LewisÂ’ picks arenÂ’t so good, but he gets a Watto, Jar-Jar, and some other stuff.  I drive back to LewisÂ’ house and drop him off, then head home.
