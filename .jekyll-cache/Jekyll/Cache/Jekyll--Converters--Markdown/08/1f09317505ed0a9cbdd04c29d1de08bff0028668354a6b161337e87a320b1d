<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>Depending on the deck you play, you should play differantly. This holds true with many decks but especially with this one. If you are playing a hunt down or unknown type, you need to get chasm out. This can stop them from drawing that Visage destiny 7 or even better hurt them for drawing the same vader in a dueling or battle destiny. But wait, thereâ€™s more Set up the uh oh Bo Shuda combo and use take me to Jabba to put out rennek and then figrin. Use figrin to wager every turn especially if playing Hunt Down. Suddenyl the odds of them drawing a vader or doubled unique card increases, you retrieve and theey lose force
This isnâ€™t the main strategy however. Most of it revolves around the classic beatdown with mains, Super Falcon and multi-destinies.
Should you play Raltiir, try to get the Hâ€™mnethe and the eloms out in battles. Beezer can stop reacts and the Mechanical failure is a powerfuly destructive tool.
Herc Seff is awesome in reducing drain potential and the starships with Landing Claw can give you a decent bit of aid in space. This deck is all about careful planning as stated with the starting interrupt.</p>

<p>On a side note I named it after Mark Hamill for obvious reasons. Heâ€™s got some cool pictures in the deck. Also Iâ€™d someday like to see people post along with thier strategy on the deck, ways to play against this deck so it would look like

I just find things like that funny. â€˜</p>
