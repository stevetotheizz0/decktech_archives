<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>First Turn you pull out the War Room and the corridor, next turn Dagobah and Yoda’s Hut. Then Drop down and beat down. Oola is for Hoth just stick her there and use her whenever you can. Recycle high destiny, and do your best to track it. The baby SAC (4-2-0) can be helpful for that effect or interrupt you just need to get rid of. If you know you’re going to have to sense something and they have Hunt Down, hold on to the sesnse because you’ll need more than one to draw a 1 or less. The spies are there for perimeter patrol/Endor Ops. The little space goes a long way. Why cloud City? I don’t have to worry about Always thinking with you’re stomach, and there’s two sites with 2 dark icons, so Imp. decree won’t hurt as bad. That’s it…</p>

<p>Peace Out’</p>
