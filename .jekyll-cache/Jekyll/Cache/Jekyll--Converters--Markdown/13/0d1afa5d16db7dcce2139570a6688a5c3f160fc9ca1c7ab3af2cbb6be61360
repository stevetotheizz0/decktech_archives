I"<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">ok so a few weeks back i go to a tourney and like 5 people show, so it goes unsanctioned, no prizes or ratings or stuff and i’m kinda bummed.  so a few weeks later we decide to go to tolcon the next week and playtest some.  paul, jacob, pubes, doug and i are gonna go, but paul and pubes gotta work and dougs got "company" so its just me and jacob.
<br />
i’m pretty sure i’m gonna play mwyhl and rops but gotta test out this speeder thing when we get there, its good but i like the dagobah deck better. so i decide on mwyhl cause its really tough to beat. jacob has made the imperial occupation deck that uses tatooine and generic sites, and wants to use my yops for light ( dont ask)
<br />
<br />
so we hear there are 3 tourneys duncan is running, but we only want swccg swiss (there was a cool idea, the player who plays in all 3 tourneys w/best overall score is the triathelete champ)
<br />
<br />
so we get there and wait about 30 minutes after its supposed to start and 3 people show and it gets sanctioned. 
<br />
in the mean time we play a game where you gotta guess rares in packs and whoever guesses the most right gets the packs.
<br />
<br />
well now its time to start. my light is basically yannick lapointes deck from gencon, test 1, falcon, afa, ect
<br />
dark deck is rops with lots of mains, emperor, force lightning, overseeing it personally, ect
<br />
<br />
<br />
game 1. my light vs evan’s bhbm/weapons
<br />
ok i start battle order,wise advice and the anti-odds card (i do every game). he starts the normal stuff but his 3 effects are crossfire, an entire legion of my best troops and superficial damage.  so thats strange but i say ok and we play. he gets out cc downtown plaza. i give him luke and his objective eats him for like 15-20 force throughout the game. so he gets in a few drains and duels, and i cant get test 1 off nor find afa or cap’n han so i’m worried. i drop epp obi vs a few bounty hunters with guns (actua guns, not epps)and i kill them, and get in a few drains there, but eventually kill off obi (on the edge for 6 when no 7’s are in your deck, like automatic-ghhhk) to avoid the beatdown.
<br />
i setup falcon with leia in it draining at kessel and keep hyper escape handy.  eventually find my afa and win duels, drain him out win by 14.
<br />
fw (2) +14
<br />
hi: winning
<br />
lo: not getting any cards i needed at the start
<br />
<br />
game 2. my dark vs ???? roche/asteroids
<br />
well he stars roche and some anti sac and anti odds. i start rop, iao, mob points and opressive enforcement. i’m worried cause i dont have chybc in my deck. anyway i set up fast, and flip turn 2 i think.  he tries to set up rycars run but i kill his ship.  i get out ability x3 and search n destroy and start rolling. cancel the 1 sanctuary he deploys since i control roche.  basically i was draining for 6 on ralltiir, 2 from aaa, and 1 from s &amp; destroy a turn and that did him in.
<br />
fw (4) +33
<br />
hi: winning vs a deck i wasnt sure i could beat
<br />
lo: not winning by more since i overdeployed
<br />
<br />
game 3. my light vs jacobs tat occupation
<br />
so we both know each others decks inside out and know i’ll win, basically its a question of by how much. anyway he gets crap out early due to his 14 force turn 2. well i fight him with luke/obi, hose ocupation with honor, and use afa to cause damage.  he has a bunch of stuff at the system and i cant get together the 2nd copy of mega falcon so i let him drain me in space.  i use on the edge for like 15-20 force through the game.  i get out some good stuff like clash of sabers, beat him up and win.
<br />
fw (6) +47?
<br />
hi: i won, but it was kinda cheap since i knew his deck
<br />
lo: beating a friend
<br />
<br />
so i’m 3-0 and in the lead, here is the showdown for the title.
<br />
game 4. my dark vs dans docking bay mains
<br />
he starts the "matt lush rop killa" start and i’m worried. io start ultimatium in case he gots odds. well he deploys tawss khaa to a dbay and i’m not as worried as i would be vs eloms.  so i deploy mara to fight tawss, tawss steals maras stick and i gotta lose her.  so he gets lots of stuff to raltiir and yavin d-bays, and is draining me for 2 a turn, while i run and drain but he retrieves with fingerin dan. ( i never flipped the entire game, if anyone cares).
<br />
so i put desert between the dbay and rest of ralltiir and he wnt move cause he thinks i have sandwhirl. so i get out some stuff and drain some.  he puts out draw there fire (this may have won me the game and lost it for him). i get setup and am fighting his stuff and draining, doing damage with dtf. he is also, so its pretty even and getting down to the wire.  he puts ackbar alone at his cc corridor thinking i’m out of guys, but down comes lord vader to stop that. slowly but surely i begin to takle out caharacter by character (arnet and asts pilot adding to attrition is huge)
<br />
from wedge, obi, han to jedi luke w/stick. i have like 4 cards left he has 3, and i deploy aaa. he then draws his last card after losing 2 to aaa, which gives me the tourney.
<br />
fw (8) +50ish
<br />
hi: winning the game even though i didnt flip
<br />
lo: winning mainly because of his card (dtf)
<br />
<br />
so i win, and dans loss puts jacob in 2nd place, while dan finishes at 3rd.
<br />
<br />
i get good prizes, some packs and a rare from duncan, i pick foil ben
<br />
