<p>1 jabba the hutt</p>

<p>1 lando calrissian</p>

<p>1 bane malar â€˜</p>

<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>well this is pretty simplistic. on the turn 1 i pull out lando and the east platform. turn 2 hopefully i drew either docking bay 94 or audience chamber. hopefully i can have lando to tatooine byt the end of this turn. turn three bring out jabba to the audience chamber and move lando with jabbaâ€™s proze there. now jabba is power 6 plus a destiny and has immunity to attrition less than 6. he should be ok all by himself at the audience chamber. especially with none shall pass. fromt his point on focus on setting up the dark deal. you can use mobilization points to pull the executor from reserve deck. and deploy to bespin cloud city long enough to play dark deal. try to hold on to it with the starships in the deck. i wouldnt try venturing further than cloud city though. use bounty to retreive force wheenerv they bring domeone out. and jeep yer captrives at the itnerrogation room for a heafty force drain bonus. this deck should be able to out drain most decks. any help with this deck is appreciated thank you.</p>
