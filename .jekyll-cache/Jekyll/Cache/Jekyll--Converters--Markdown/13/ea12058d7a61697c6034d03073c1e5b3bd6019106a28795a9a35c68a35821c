<p>Objectives (1)
Rebel Stike Team/Garrison Destroyed  ‘</p>

<p>Strategy: ‘</p>

<p>Well, this deck flip the objective by blowing up the bunker.</p>

<p>To start signal for Goo Nee Tay or if SAC is big go with Do, Or Do Not.</p>

<p>Now here’s the tech.  It Can Wait &amp; Yoda’s Stew gets you the force and the power to keep the bunker clear so you can do that nice 8 damage.</p>

<p>The character base is very strong, using the endor persona’s of han and chewie are for recycling chewie and han being immune &lt; 4 plus his nice ‘tarkin’ ability.</p>

<p>The ships are the best the LS can muster without swarm so can give a good challenge to the DS decks.</p>

<p>So really look at this deck…it has battle power and completes the objective.	No numbers protection because I don’t see it in my area but you can easily sub it into the deck.  Also you may question dueling protection being zero.  Well for starters I just let the DS try to duel me.  I’ll wait till they play vader then just drop obi elsewhere.  I don’t mind if we both lose from visage.</p>

<p>For against ops the dresselian commandos are nearly gods.</p>

<p>For blowing away the bunker you can nicely use throw me another charge and grab explosive charges or add to your destiny.  Plus it’s a cycling 6 that stops the big trooper swarm also.</p>

<p>After the bunker goes boom then what?  Well it’s mains and stuff hold out and drain on endor…and in space with the “fleet”.</p>

<p>Remember if the DS really plays to hold the bunker let them.  Just go drain away on endor and beatdown on their other hold outs.</p>

<p>Thanks for looking.</p>
