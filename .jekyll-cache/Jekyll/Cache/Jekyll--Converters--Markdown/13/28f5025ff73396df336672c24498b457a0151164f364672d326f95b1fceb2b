<p>Strategy: â€˜</p>

<p>The strategy behind this deck is to get an Echo site and EBG first turn. Using the latter, get out Hobbie, Zev, and Wedge to set up EBO by your 3-4 turn. Once thatâ€™s done, get set up with at least 3 X-Wings at Kiffex first, then Tatooine, then Bespin if needed. From there, distract a ground opponent with spies and EPP beats while you drain for at least 7 a turn. Against a space opponent, beat them up with OA and Incom Cor. If ties are big in your area, use Aim High instead of Wise Advice and add another grabber. Here in Seattle, Rallops and HuntDown are still pretty strong, (although Ties are getting popular) so thatâ€™s why I use 2 Trans. Term, cause most HD players donâ€™t expect it anymore. Against Rallops, well, just set up faster than them and track your OA so the added destiny wonâ€™t like wipe out all your X-Wings.
This is a solid deck, it makes good use of EBG so you donâ€™t have to use key characters to set up EBO, and it gets mass activation for EPP beats. Oh yeah, the system choice is based on drain potential (Kiffex) and battle advantage (Put like 4 wings at either Bespin or Tatooine, EPP Beats just got better) So try this deck out, itâ€™s fun and good, itâ€™s, itâ€™sâ€¦ just a solid EBO.â€™</p>
