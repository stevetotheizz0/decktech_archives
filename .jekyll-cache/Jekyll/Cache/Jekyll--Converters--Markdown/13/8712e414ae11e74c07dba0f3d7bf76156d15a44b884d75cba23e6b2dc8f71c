<h2 id="techniquestrategy">Technique/Strategy</h2>
<p>Against Bring Him Before Me or Hunt Down and Destroy The Jedi on Turn 1
send Yor Insight Serves you well to the lost pile to retrieve
Honor Of The Jedi</p>

<p>For Jedi Test #5 Try To Track a 7â€¦.Against BHBM your should try to track
R2 in Red 5 so that when You defeat Vader in a BHBM duel, Luke will not
cross to the DS.</p>

<p>At Peace is in here For Protection Against Broken Concentration.</p>

<p>Once The Training Grounds is out, Search for a Jedi Test During EVERY
TURN, This includes Your Opponents Kepp all Jedi tests in Hand
at All Times.</p>

<p>Intruder Missles arent just here for Destiny Tracking, They can deploy on
EVERY Starfighter in the deck except R2 in Red 5 and Red Squadron 1.
And the Quad laser cannon is For The Starfighters.</p>

<p>Super Falcon = 4 destinies
Han(P), Lando(P), Liea, Nien Nunb
Put leia as a Pilot With Lando If You Encounter ZIMH</p>

<p>Sense Alter Protection - I know it will be hard at first with the +4 and
the high Destiny Deck, But After you flip, which doesnâ€™t take long, You
should be able to keep your opponent from playing any devstating effects,
or intterupts. OFFENSE</p>

<p>Retrieval, against Something Special Planned for them, Being able to
retriev 18 cards should be good enoughâ€¦Having that card placed out
of play shouldnt hurt you too bad.</p>

<p>ROCHE - Battground System where opponent canâ€™t force drain you.
	Also Used with S&amp;KF</p>

<p>Wedge vs Red Squadron leader â€“ I use Wedge Instead he has better destiny,
and I dontplay with other Red/Rogue Squadron pilots except Luke.</p>

<p>Crackshot - This card just kicks butt in this deck because I hit so often.
&lt;/I&gt;â€™</p>
