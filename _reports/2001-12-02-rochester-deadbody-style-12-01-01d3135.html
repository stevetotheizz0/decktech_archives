<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay here is the TR from the tournament at Face the Music in Rochester on 12-1-01 run by Peter Jacobson.  I wenet with the same DS as last week Lightsaber combat with lots of random  7’s and Dark Jedi beats, for LS I was all set to go with TIGIHis Deadbody (updated with soem r3) until my DS beat it like a $3 hooker, so I stayed up way past my bedtime to build Throne Room Mains with Bacta Tank Luke beats, basically it chews up Lightsaber Combat like a hungry wombat, and can handle everything else if played right.  so anyway on to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my DS vs. Ian and his PodProfit<br/>
 The most uneventful game of the day, I won the race cause his destiny suck, and mine don’t, he loaded up in the Audience chamber with everyone but a Jedi and I took over my 2 sites, I was draining like mad, so he dropped Qui-Gon, who was combatted away by Darth Maul, then Ian spread out his guys on Tatooine, the opportunity that I had been waiting for I activaed all but 1 (a 6) deployed Lord vader and a combat card of 7 under him to the site next to luke, moved him in and iniated Vaders Obsession, I won by 8 retrieved 8 and the 8 he lost ended the game.  FW by 35<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my LS vs. Ryan and his Lightsaber combat<br/>
 Wow dream matchup, a scrub playing the deck mine is designed to beat.  actually a really boring game for him, I got out all my Twixes, and revoed his.  I activated 20 to his 5 and dropped EPP beats on anyone he deployed, usually Luke w/Saber on a jedi slash both die, luke swims in Bacta, repeat.  When he left Aurra Sing at a site alone Han, Leia (both epp stylin’) and Chewie protector jumped him for 25 force overflow and drained him out. FW by 27<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 my LS vs. Mike Raveling and his BHBM that he tossed together in the car<br/>
 Okay this was a really fun game, but Mike got killed by the same thing that helped do in Ryan the game before Goo Nee Tay and no Icons from me.  We battled over the only Battleground which was the Endor DB, I revoed 2 of his sites and drained in the Throne room and at the exec DB with wusses when he finally got vader out (after Palpy was dead) he got luke and went to my Hoth DB where he couldn’t fulfill the CHYBC defensive shield so he had to come back to the endor DB where I met him with epp Obi and death, I should have won by more, but I wasted both my On the Edges trying to houjix Leia I used the first and said 6 knowing that I only had 1 7 in the deck and it might not be in my reserve, plus it is r2 in red 5 and I drew it than like the goof that I am forgot that I could use it as a 0 and used my other to kill her off, thereby killing all my retrieval.  Oh well it was a fun game, and I was really proud to shake Mikes Cold Clammy hand and walk away with a win by 8.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 my DS vs. Graham Neal and his WYS<br/>
 This was a really boring game with only about 2 battles, both in the cantina where I got rid of his guys, and he got rid of mine, but since he has a lot more characters in his deck than I do, he got the better end of it.  This was really a drain race, and since he had more locations (and I have no space so his kessel drain went uncontested) he pulled it out by 7<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 my LS vs. Tyler and his Lightsaber combat.<br/>
 See game 2 with a few minor differences.  He came to battle my Home 1 with Thrawn on the exec, used Imperial command to draw a 3rd destiny, even though I had 17 in forfeit in pilots alone so Home 1 would stay alive, I grabbed the imperial command and then deployed the venerable Han Leia Chewie combo to draw a stacked 6,5,4 (the 4 was random) to blow up the big E and take over space until late when he deployed Zuckuss at Carida to try and lower differential.  The other main difference is he kept coming to attack me, at the Naboo Docking Bay, where Fallen portal made him waste Tarkins Ability twice, and my EPP’s held strong against the vile Dark Jedi Herd.  Full win by 22.<br/>
<br/>
At this point I am in 2nd behind Graham who is undefeated but whose differential sucked (he had just beaten Mike by 1 and was going to play him again) but Justin wasn’t far behind and since he spent the day playing scrubs I knew I needed a good game here to have a chance of winning.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 my DS vs. Chris Perman and his LS Senate<br/>
 This was the most boring game I have ever played it was a total drain race since we had 1 battle that just killed off both sides, and after that I wouldn’t go to Corescant and he wouldn’t come to Naboo, we just drained and since I had drained for 5 almost the entire game, and he drained for at most 3 (until the last turn) my drains did him in.  Full win by 18.<br/>
<br/>
So Mike beats Graham and Justin can’t win by enough to catch me, and I walk away the victor with my 2nd foil Twi’lek to show for it.<br/>
<br/>
Final 10 (+103)<br/>
1. Me Garrett Larson<br/>
2. Justin Alfs<br/>
3. Graham Neal<br/>

It is decided that Justin and I should come to every Rochester Tourney being the most succesful car in attendence for the second straight time.<br/>
