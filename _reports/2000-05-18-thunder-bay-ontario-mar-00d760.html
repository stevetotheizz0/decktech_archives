<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well this is kinda out of date but I wasn't sure that this should be posted.  Thunder Bay, Ontario is located away from anything on the shores of Lake Superior.  That outta the way we have 6 regular players but do have about 10 that play SWCCG.  We decided one day to run a tourney but not at all a regular style.  So the 6 regulars decided we'd make it fun.  We played the tourney over 2 gaming sessions and set it up as such;  No deck changes were allowed once we started so we had to list our deck contents and leave the list with the store owner who could check the decks if a question arose (never happened cause we trust each other enough).  So basically we had to play each person once over these 2 days and the final game was between the 1,2 3,4 5,6 players.  So basically we played 6 games each 3 DS 3 LS.  Now that I explained our unorthadoxed tourney setup I can get onto the regular tourney report.<br/>

<br/>
Saturday morning arrives and after a night at the bar till 2am then out for food till 4am I barely get up at 10am to get to the store for 11am.  I worked on my decks over the week and felt they were tweaked as I wanted them.  For DS I was playing a version of my Powerhouse Aliens deck i've posted on decktech.  It's a court start then I take to the air using the objective gametext to get ships out.  Used scum for retrieval and had ORS and mara on the ground with at-ats.  For LS I was playing a deck I've been working on but didn't do as well as I wanted to.  It's a levitation deck that uses super falcon and tatooine celebration.  Basically has 3 tunnel visions, 3 jedi levitaions, 1 starship levitation, 1 levitation.  So I figured i'd get what I want when I want.<br/>
<br/>
So get to the store at 10 to 11 and head over to the game room.  The store owner is totally cool (had a class with him in university).  He bought a new location and set up 2 game rooms just for CCG players so basically every weekend some CCG has a room booked.  The other players arrive with the last getting there at 1120.<br/>
<br/>
Finally we start, we all act as TD for ruling (basically vote on a ruling if we can't find it in the CRD).<br/>
<br/>
Players are:  Derek (myself), Ian, Mark, Marky Mark (2 marks but this one likes to wear the skaters pants), Kris and Josh.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 1  DS vs Ian Endor Ops (a pet project of his and mine)<br/>
<br/>
Well Ian didn't know what I was playing so started regular Endor ops start and goo ney ta.  I start court and scum.  First few turns we set up our hands and he deploys first.  Drops bunker, epic event and DOS and movers her to bunker.  Now I know his deck enough not to go smack lone leia.  So basically I retaliate with Zuckass in ship to endor and boba to kashyyyk.  He smiles activates, plays throw me another charge grabs a charge and plays it and another.  So i'm looking at getting that bunker blown up next turn.  I go drain him for 3 and look to my hand.  I have mara, bliz 1 and ORS.  So i drop them to rebel landing site.   He looks worried now since he hits me for 8 with the bunker but i smack down for 5 with drain.  His turn he pulls for bunker and my god...I lose 8 force.  Then he drops endor han&amp; chewie against mara and company.  We draw destiny, cancels mine but he draws a 2.  He loses 2 force and says go.  Well I drain for 3 drop kiffex and play bossk in bus there.  Move at-at to hidden trail.  Now he's worried cause i have lone mara at his chewie han combo.  He activates and initiates.  I drop moment of triumph and pull my destiny 4 (he cancels) then a 6.  He draws 0.  So he's pissed right off.  He loses chewie.  I figure I have the game.  Me turn I drop blizz at-at with mara she hops aboard and basically that ends the game.  He battles a bit on the ground but loses each time.  I retrieve with scum a few times.<br/>
<br/>
FW 22<br/>
Highs:  My deck working out ok although he had no space in his deck.<br/>
Lows: Dam bunker and his bluff about warriors courage and leia.<br/>
<br/>
Ian tells me after he couldn't seem to draw the characters he needed.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 LS vs Mark Ralops<br/>
<br/>
So I'm all ready for this deck, he's play ralops for so long that i'm used to what he's playing.  So I start tat, farm and spaceport street.  He does normal ralops start with swamp and bad feeling.  He goes and pulls a sleen drops a site and plays a sleen to that.  SO i'm looking at a force choke from a Ralops and he's getting 3 force from me.  So I smile activate and leave my force there.  He goes drops another site pulls a sleen.  So now he has his setup already and I have nothing going.  My turn activate and drop ben to farm with sabre.  His turn he drops 3  2 ability imperials to ralops sites and flips obj.  Then drops vader against ben.  SO i think cool battle time.  He doesn't battle.  SO i activate, tunnel vision and pull out leia with blaster.  Can't play her though not enough force.  I pass on fighting it out (stupid me).  His turn he drops tarkin against ben initiates battle then plays circle complete (ack where did that come from) i draw oh 5 he cancels and draws a 5 plays destiny adding dueling interrupt and draws a 3.  Well obi dies and such... blah blah blah.  So he locks me down on activation.  I save up for a couple turns drop falcon out to tat and move to raltir but his drains hurt and bad feeling pisses me off.  <br/>
<br/>
FL 17<br/>
Highs: None got stomped, well he got stuck with a big hand.<br/>
Lows: Got Stomped....pulled no sites or levitations.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3  LS vs Josh CCT Drain.<br/>
<br/>
Well i give him chewie with gun and do my reg start.  He starts any methods.  His turn activates drops dengar with gun and moves chewie to prison.  I go, activate drop ben to farm and drop Rendezvous Point.  He goes plays down some sites and a few characters (his collection isn't big so it's basically non mains).  I activate and drop luke with sabre and leia at one of the sites.  Battle hit both his characters. He draws 3, i smoke screen for 5.  He loses both characters and about 11.  I take over draining on CC he battles a bit but i get savrip out so lose nothing at the sites.<br/>
<br/>
FW 16<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Getting an ok draw.<br/>
Lows: Not getting the levitations going again.<br/>
<br/>
So that ends day 1 and we all talk about how our decks worked or not.  Kris is the only undefeated.<br/>
<br/>
Next weekend I do the same thing stay out at the bar till 4am and get up a little later.  I arrive at 1130 apologize and curse a bit.  Then the store owner comes over with the swear jar and I dump my dollar in.  (25 cents a swear).  So they yell at me a bit for being late but whatever I was out with women they were at home watching x-files.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 4  DS vs Marky Mark Jawa Siesta<br/>
<br/>
Well basically not much said.  He had no space adn walkers trample jawas.  He did get one good battle out 6 jawas and the leader guy that makes siesta non unique.  I lost some force he loses 1 jawa forfiet like 8 or something.  Next turn i trample big boy after drawing it up and basically that ends the game.<br/>
<br/>
FW 18<br/>
Highs:  Seeing a jawa deck and trampling that noses bastard.<br/>
Lows:  Having ONE JAWA soak a 5 attrition.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 DS vs Kris Profit Farmers<br/>
<br/>
Well he's had this deck since profit came out.  He converts my sites but i start chall mara pull engineer and put my site back.  His turn he plays farmer leader and boshuda.  Well that sucks.  I go play kiffex and drop boba.  He goes drops 2 tat sites and says go.  I drop endor and zuckass there after draining him.  THen move mara and company to tat JP.  He goes and drops another site and a farmer at each.  He pays 4 force and cancels my scum and then smiles.  Well he has his big combo going but no vaporators yet so i have like 1 turn to cream him.  Look to my hand and see ORS blizz 1 and trample.  Schweet.  I drop on a farmer attack he loses a bunch, I move and trample another.  Somehow he forgot to houjix that first battle he tells me after that game.  So i feel good and @#$%y and spread out on tat.  His turn he drops ben and masta luke against ORS and blizz 1.  I play moment to get a destiny but he just revives luke so i suck it up and sack the site.  We trade drains and his luke ben team start to clean up.  My space drains finally take him out after the leaders in ships failed to move me.<br/>
<br/>
FW 7<br/>
Highs:  Having some fun, and loving the ORS and blizz 1 trample combo.<br/>
Lows: The deck has yet to get scum really working and almost losing to a farmer mass drain deck.<br/>
<br/>
Well i'm just barely in 1st place and play Kris again.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 LS vs Kris Ralops<br/>
<br/>
Well well my LS deck gets to take this on again.  Kris starts well guarded and swamp.  (Now kris and mark are good friends and figures they both decided to stomp with ralops and sleens).  My turn i get 2 sites in my hand so drop those and vision and pull capt.n han.  I have falcon in hand.  He goes drops a biker scout, site, sleen. and says go.  I activate drop han and falcon and move to raltir to stop the flip.  His turn he plays site, sleen, 2 bikers and INSERTS.  Stupid punk i didn't expect inserts.  Crappy!  So i quickly get frustrated and activate drop ben and masta to tat sites jedi levi and get leia with gun.  His turn he plays zuckas vs han and battles.  He draws 2.  So nothing happens whew!@!  My turn drop leia with gun on falcon battle play i know.  Draw a total of 6 outta 5 destiny.  Characters were all stacked crap.  He loses a bit and zuckas. Insert pops I lose 5.  He goes plays rathal and drops bossk there and inserts.  Awww crap.  I activate 4 force dam insert pops.  I lose 12 this time.  Kris is smiling across the way.  Now everyone has come to watch.  Course i'm gettting advice all around but ignoring half of it.  I move falcon over to bossk.  His turn he inserts again and drops boba in ship. battles.  I play punch it. we draw.  He plays wounded warrior.  Dammit so i get a destiny of 5 he get 8.  I lose the leia and han.   My turn activate lots.  Insert pops i lose 13.  WOw no force left.  I lose from life force and draw up.<br/>
<br/>
FL 19<br/>
Highs: Had a good start but...<br/>
Lows:  Down hill to fast....never liked going downhill.<br/>
<br/>
So Kris wins our so called tourney and gets 2 packs of reflections.  Everyone else gets a pack of endor. Kris pulls executor and boba fett SE.  I get foil paploo.  Well for the first attempt of a tourny in Thunder Bay it turned out ok.  Now of course we aren't all great players here but it was fun.  FIrst person who bothers to learn how to track destiny will probably clean house :)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  DS deck went undefeated.<br/>
Lows: LS deck didn't get celebration.  Barely levitated.  SO i'm gonna keep it and try to make it work. HEHE.<br/>
<br/>
On a side not the LS endor ops deck blew up bunker in every game but only won 1 game.  A improved version of it is posted on my page.  Ian and I worked on it and it's actually a viable deck now.<br/>
