<br/>
Intro:<br/>
<br/>
For the first time, that is as far as I can remember, there would be a tournament in Amsterdam, Holland. As the Reservoir dogs have their roots in or around Amsterdam we would play with home-court advantage in this tournament!<br/>
As I wanted to perform well in this tournament, I tried to come up with two good decks.<br/>
In conversations with Johan however, I told him I would try a Court deck. I thought I could construct a court deck that can win almost all of his games, but that was not the case!<br/>
I found out that court decks with mains or bounty hunters need lots of activation to perform well. Even with this knowledge, my adapted court decks didnt seem to earn the rights to be called vile or nefarious! Tedious and cannon fodder were words that more suited the name of the objective. As a member of the Reservoir dogs I refused to play a deck that is known as the tedious gangster deck. Pieter decided to play Skrillings and I did not want to play the same decks. I had to come up with something else. Without breaking my agreement with Johan, who went on winter-sport vacation in the weekend of the tournament, I played a court deck with my favorite gangstas: Musicians!<br/>
<br/>
I knew my favorite gangsters wouldnt let the Reservoir dogs status down, but court decks are somewhat weak against decks that convert your audience chamber. For profit decks Chall Bekan was hired to influence some of the local engineers to redecorate Jabbas room into something more darker! For Obis hut players that convert, after careful planning, your audience chamber to the same dull interior as Bens hut, I was still looking for some fun lovin criminals to solve that problem! So after adjusting some cards to hopefully take the local meta off guard, I was done with my Dark side deck. With the new album of the Cure in my stereo, I decided to honor the musicians to play the title song, and also the best song, from the album Bloodflowers! The title of my deck reflects the opinion that musicians are nothing but flowers that can be crushed in an instant, but in fact are a collective machine that is dedicated to crush the rebellion!<br/>
<br/>
For Light side I was looking for something new, luckily I had the opportunity to get some input from some great players: Yannick Lapointe and Scott Lingrell (thanks guys!)<br/>
After testing Yannicks deck I liked it a lot but was not sure if I could play it efficiently enough. So after reading a great report from Scott, I asked him which deck could inflict so much fear in players they start packing specific cards for his deck! After testing this deck and looking at the local meta and the small amount of players that would probably come, I decided to play a version of the harvest choke. I adapted it to match my playing style and the local meta. The deck is centered around conservative farmers that would like to see Luke as a Farmwalker instead of a Skywalker. So the deck title would reflect this aspect of Lukes ambitions in relationship with his concerned guardians Owen and Beru.<br/>
So what better title than a song called Spaceboy from the Smashing Pumpkins. The song can be found on of the greatest albums ever made: Siamese dream!<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday I playtested with  Arjan, a.k.a. Nice guy Eddie and we were all set for the tournament. I had a basketball match that evening, I dont want to talk about it, but lets say I was very glad that I went out with some friends that night. After getting two and half hours of sleep that night, I woke up remarkably fit to play. I had to take the bus way too early, sometimes the departure times are made just to frustrate you I think. I was glad that I brought some papers, a magazine and my discman with the Deftones trying to keep me awake. (with the volume turned up, this works like a charm : ) )<br/>
<br/>
After arriving at central station in Amsterdam I noticed that a tram was stranded somwhere it did not seem to belong. The tram was off the track and nearly crashed with a little shop. It was just one of those days because the tram prevented our tram from leaving!<br/>
I saw Pieter standing in front of central station and we laughed about the irony. When Arjan showed up, the tram 17 that left from another railtrack just left and we took a bus. Meanwhile two other players, Willem Sterk and Robin van Beek saw us and were glad to see us.                 ( because of the accident they did not know how to get to the tournament)<br/>
Willem and Robin are somewhat younger players, but they have improved a lot in the last year. It was good to see some competition, there was another tournament in Utrecht and many good players went to Utrecht instead of Amsterdam. Although it is a good thing to have more tournaments in Holland, it was unfortunate that there were 2 tournaments being held on the same day and pretty close to each other. We arrived at the Vierhoek and saw a couple of players. There were already 2 regulars, Albondi and Jos, the other players were members of the European Youth League. This would be the first sanctioned tournament for these players!<br/>
After some trading and playing a friendly game with Arjan, Bas van Zuilen was ready to announce the pairings.<br/>
We had 10 players for the tournament, so Quentin Tarantino would be working double shifts to direct all the Mexican shootouts that were bound to happen. I missed the announcements of the pairings, but I saw Pieter looking at me that let me to believe I had to play him.<br/>
We were both displeased, I was afraid for both of his decks. Both decks can easily beat my decks! I was somewhat relieved that I did not have to play his killer Skrillings.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS vs. Pieters LS mains &amp; toys choke and beat down deck <br/>
<br/>
I deploy my court stuff and Pieter starts with the hut. Like a true gentleman Pieter asked me if he should convert my audience chamber. I saw he was feeling bad about it and replied that he put his audience chamber in his deck for a reason! So I start with 3 force in play and I know I am in trouble. My hand had no defensive cards, Greeata and or Ak-rev so I just pick up some cards. Pieter knows the power of musicians and just deploys a location and a traffic control.<br/>
I searched for my key cards and declined from deploying anything, so we were both losing force to keep the Vile Court happy. Pieter was unlucky with his tunnel visions he told me after the game, he was searching for a Ben or a grimtaash but found neither!<br/>
 I finally deployed some aliens to the audience chamber and had a none shall pass, tarkins orders and 2 elis helrots in hand. If he had the played the used version of grimtaash before I could deploy my musicians my 20+ hand would be reduced tremendously! He now was one turn too late, but still his grimtaash put a lot of essential cards to my used pile.<br/>
Frozen assets was played and beat down crew  got busy: Han + blaster, Leia + blaster, Chewie + blaster, Luke + lightsaber and Obi + lightsaber eradicated most of my musicians.<br/>
Greeata was there so my musicians were able to withstood some of the onslaught: Greeata and Lyn Me survived. Pieter wisely lost his Chewie and let him go to the lost pile instead of the bacta tank, because he knew I would try to retaliate. I put up a fight at the audience chamber next turn to retrieve Ak-rev and some other musicians. After the battle Greeata and one other musician survived, while pieter lost Han to the bacta tank. I had quite some force left under frozen assets and took a gamble by letting the 2 musicians in front of his beat down crew. I had 2 elis helrots, if however Pieter played another frozen assets I would be doomed.<br/>
Apparently he had none in his hand and at the end of the deployment phase I try to elis helrot to the cantina: I draw a  Tech Mor ( AGGGGHHHHH) but it was just enough as I had six force left. Somehow I got the feeling the cantina would be not so comfortable when he nabruned to the cantina. Were doomed went to my mind once again, then I realized that my tarkins orders was not grimtaashed out of my hand! Pieter was also tired after a couple of long days as he forgot to cancel Scum and Villainy when I elised away to the cantina. I reinforced the cantina, while Pieter made sure I did not want to go to the audience chamber. Battle plan was on table and we both had to pay for our drains. I was draining for two and Pieter for one. A big problem for me was the traffic control, as he started stacking high destinies back in his deck. I had a elis helrot in hand, but so long as I was draining more than Pieter I just avoided the confrontation. Pieter put back some more cards and was preparing for a mexican shootout in full effect! Frozen assets took care of my defense and this time there would be no escape for my musicians. Pieter draws a destiny for nabrun leids and its a dont forget the droid Pieter had been stacking a lot of destinies 5 and 6 but forgot he needed a nabrun first to get to the cantina. He had 5 force in force pile and I know and a Gift of the mentor in hand and was just too anxious to play them in one battle! This was one of those games were luck really comes in handy. I was able to win the remaining drain race  and won by 14.<br/>
<br/>
FW +14  2 (+14)<br/>
<br/>
Arjan had to play against a member of the EYL and although it took quite some time ( Arjan is always friendly and probably helped his opponent improve himself) but won with 36 points of differential. When the parings for the second game were announced I did not expect to play Arjan because of his high differential.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS vs. Arjans DS: Raltiir ops<br/>
<br/>
Another Mexican shootout with a member of the Reservoir dogs. This was not the match-up  that I wanted to see, because my LS is still in the early stages of its development while Arjans deck is a great deck. He starts bad feeling have I and I start Obis hut and moisture farm. Arjan apparently had a god draw: deploying prefects office, security precautions, Death star and forest from reserve deck ( after the game he told me he also had a grapple card in his opening hand) My opening hand showed me 7 red cards and Oola, so things were looking pretty good ( DUH). I activate and draw some cards in the hope of finding characters and locations. I got Orrimaarko and the Yodas hut. Arjan activated 9 force second turn and deployed jungle to Raltiir, secret plans and I think one force base location. He decided to draw some and save up. His hand was pretty small and if I wanted to win this game I had to gamble. I deploy Oola to the hut and Yodas hut and draw some. Arjan went for the flip with Nemet, Blizzard scout 4 with pilot and a tempest 1 scout with an AT-ST pilot. He moved Nemet over to the Blizzard scout 4 and he was finished. I had enough force to Oola his hand, but this would leave me Orri and Owen to release Raltiir out of the hands of the Empire, so I draw some cards. I got a Ben, a revolution, Leia and a Falcon, with my nabrun leids already in my hand I had a small chance to flip the objective back. Arjan fetched something from reserve, deployed imperial arrest order, Vader and Ardan. I deployed Ben and Owen, nabruned to Raltiir and hoped they could hold their ground one turn waiting for the Falcon to arrive. Arjan had already an evader in hand, he told me after the game. For every move I could think of, Arjan had prepared a countermove in advance! There was nothing left to do then hope Arjan would make a mistake that let me back in the game. Arjan however played an excellent game and he really deserved to win. We talked about the game and although Arjan had come close in previous games this was his first victory in tournament play against me.<br/>
<br/>
FL 22  (2 8)<br/>
<br/>
Pieter won against Stephan de Vos, a member of the EYL, in a close game and Willem Sterk also won his second game. Arjan and Willem probably had to face each other in the next round and I  hoped I could finally play a non-Reservoir dog! After the pairings were announced I had to face Robin van Beek with my LS deck. I was disappointed with my loss in the previous game and hoped to better this game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 LS: vs. Robins DS This deal trooper deck with mains<br/>
<br/>
I started with the hut and moisture farm, Robin started with Port town district and Any methods necessary fetching Jodo Kast. I had a decent hand, but I knew I had to be careful with his deck ( Trooper decks are/ were popular in Holland and I assumed this was a trooper deck). Robin deployed Bespin from reserve, prison and den of thieves from hand. After deploying my location I pick up a Falcon and I was ready to go to Bespin. Robin deployed four troopers to the district, but his activation was limited to 6 and this would be problematic for him. ( I did not intend to give him anymore force : ) )<br/>
I deployed Leia and Lando in the Falcon to Bespin, with Robins limited activation battle plan would be painful for him so battle plan also made an appearance on table. The game progressed with Robin draining for 2 and having little cards in hand, while I was draining at Bespin with massive force generation at my disposal. My drains were absorbed by his large amount of troopers. Oola then took out all of the surprises out of the deck and I could savely deploy Han and Chewie in order to let me drain for no cost at all. The farming or harvest engine was ready to begin, when Robin tried to set up dark deal. He had no force left to deploy a ship to Bespin Cloud City, so I moved the Falcon over. Harvest did his work, even with secret plans out, and I won with 37.<br/>
<br/>
FW + 37  (4 +29)<br/>
<br/>
So that went pretty well and I was glad to see the choke part work as well. Pieter won his game, but Arjan lost with his Raltiir ops deck against Willem. It was too bad that Arjan could not maintain his excellent play into the next games, but more of that in later rounds. I had to play Arjan again and Pieter had to play against Willem, so this would be a crucial round to determine the pairings in the last games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 DS vs. Arjans LS mains &amp; toys beat down <br/>
<br/>
Arjan started the hut and tossche station and I went for secret plans and my usual court stuff. Arjan has the most experience playing against musicians, because Johan, the creator of the first killer musician deck, and I have already played numerous versions of musicians decks against him! He was careful and played lots of mains at the tossche station. He converted my audience chamber and I was beginning to drain for two with my musicians at the audience chamber and Arjan for 1 at the station (doesnt this sound familiar : ) ). But Arjan deployed Kessel, Lando and another pilot in the Falcon ( I knew he had punch it and legendary starfighter in hand, so I did not want to go there yet)<br/>
My musicians were getting ready for a beat down on his characters but elis was not yet in my hand. He finally spreads out a bit, but has an incom hopper to react to Leia and Han. I elised during his turn to Obi and Luke and the hopper, leaving Ak-rev, Greeata and Lirin at the chamber. My turn I deployed Umpass, 4-Lom, Lyn Me and some other musicians, Arjan tries to nabrun Han and Leia over. I play tarkins orders, he realizes my power and tries to nabrun another time. He fails and this battle would be all mine : ).<br/>
4-lom cancels Luke +lightsabers gametext, Lyn Me reduces his total power (after drawing battle destiny) to 1 ( yes, that is correct) and my power is 57 ( that is also correct : ) ).<br/>
So after forfeiting Luke, Ben and shuttle Arjan has to lose almost 30 force. He counts his hand and reserve deck and congratulates me with my victory!<br/>
<br/>
FW +21  6 (+50)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 No more Mr. Nice guy (Eddie), the musicians must have thought after losing my second game against Arjan. That was a brutal battle!<br/>
Pieter had lost to Willem, who is still undefeated. I hope I have to play Willem twice to have a shot at the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 LS vs. Willems DS space deck<br/>
<br/>
Willem starts Death star and come here you big coward, as Robin had already yelled loud that I played an annoying harvest deck. It doesnt bother me much because my engine is not planning to start early in the game and even then with all my tunnel visions it shouldnt be a problem. I start the hut and moisture farm. I have a good hand with Ben and 2 force base locations. I deploy my locations and move Ben over to the farm. He deploys Endor and picks up some cards. I already have Leia + Han in hand and draw a Luke and the audience chamber.<br/>
He deploys an undercover agent to the farm and saves up. I have a huge force pile ready to take on anything he comes up with and just wait. He deploys 2 dreadnoughts with Ozzel to Endor and picks up all his cards. He later said that was a stupid move, but I had a beggar in hand in case he did leave any force I just used the beggar :).  I activate even more and have 2 tunnel visions in hand. Tunnel vision #1: I see Cpt. Han and Falcon, I go for Falcon.<br/>
Tunnel vision #2: I go for Cpt. Han. I deploy them along with Leia to Endor and beat up his ships. One dreadnought remained. He fears order to engage, this is a correct assumption as I have one in my hand, and initiates an attack with the lone dreadnought. He forfeits and loses one and saves up. I deploy Luke to the audience chamber and pick up and get an I know, so I am ready for the taskforce that is definitely coming! He comes with executor and Vaders shuttle, I know takes care of this little problem by drawing 5 battle destinies for a total of 19.<br/>
This was the game breaker and I retrieve with the farming engine and win with 39.<br/>
<br/>
FW +39   8 (+89)<br/>
<br/>
Pieter won big time against Albondi and Arjan lost to Robin. Everybody has to play the same opponent with opposite sides. I know that if I beat Willem I win the tournament. I also realize that if I win, Pieter can overtake Willem for second place,  so I intend to make sure the Dogs remain on top!<br/>
Game 6 DS  vs.  Willems LS hidden base deck<br/>
I start my court stuff and Willem starts hidden base, I forgot if he played a starting effect.<br/>
I proceeded to assemble a great line-up of musicians with Ak-rev, Greeata, Jabba, (although technically speaking he is no musician, if you however hear his tongue and tail wiggle you know better!) Lirin and one other musician. I am all set for his beat down ( I hope).<br/>
He knows that if he waits until ability^3 and search and destroy hit the table, he is lost so he comes with Leia, Chewie and Han ( all with guns). My band is reduced to a lonely Jabba, he loses Leia. Jabba is most displeased with the disturbance of his private party and summons a horde of musicians to take care of the soon to be Bantha Poodo! Oh, I almost forgot my favorite guy from Toola ( isnt he pretty Martin!) JQuille also drops by to say some famous words:  Step aside Butch ( ehhhh sorry Chewie) and combined with first strike and scum my lost musicians find their way to the used pile. Meanwhile the other musicians are getting their blowtorches ready to reduce Han to another favorite decoration! He loses 19 force, including some systems so he cannot flip anymore. I retrieve some more by battling his ships and win by 31.<br/>
<br/>
FW +31 10 (+120)<br/>
<br/>
Pieter also won his second game against Albondi and Arjan lost his second game to Robin ( after a 2-0 start, dropping to 2-4, better luck next time Arjan)<br/>
Pieter takes second and I take first in a relaxed tourney that brought new players to the tournament scene. ( that is always good to see) <br/>
I trade some more reflections, but I am still way behind Pieter in the holy quest for shiny cards. I got a WB Leia and Luke in my packs and we were on our way to grab a bite!<br/>
Thanks for the tournament Bas v. Zuilen and Johan de Vos and I will see you at a tourney soon! For my next tourney I will try to let my musicians home, but I cannot make any promises :). <br/>
