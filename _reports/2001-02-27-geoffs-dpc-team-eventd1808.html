<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">first of all i’m putting this event in the world’s section because it p1sses off charles hickey.  don’t be a jackoffasaur charles...heh.  jk:)<br/>
<br/>
so saturday was a big fat day, and now it’s sunday.  AGAIN i have to get up early to drive monkeys to the airport (brentson and girard), and then crash back at home for another 3 hours.  6 hours of sleep is the most i’ve gotten in prolly like 5 days, but i’ll have to just suck it up again ’cause there’s more star wars to be had.<br/>
<br/>
what’s up for grabs for the team event?  Uncut Special Edition sheets.  how many people show up for the team event?  14.  <br/>
<br/>
from now on i will write this report as if i were a canadian.<br/>
<br/>
this suck.  not enough player mean no competition.  only michigan team university, team old man, team scandalous from st loui and team DONKEY PUNCH?  what is donkey punch?  ask mike girard and he say "it when you punch his wife in back during sex and she get tight"  that sick. sound like something Dom would do.<br/>
<br/>
i’m gettin’ sick of writing this like a canadian...but it’s been fun.<br/>
<br/>
it made me sad that the canadian crew didn’t show up for the team event since i didn’t get to play any of them the entire weekend.  i don’t know if i’d really have wanted to because of the whole "i beat you for 115 force" thing going down, but what the heck, eh?<br/>
<br/>
i’m playing the same 2 decks from the past two days because those are what i’m most comfortable playing, and because i haven’t had time to make new ones.  (Blitzkrieg II and Hidden Phil)<br/>
<br/>
game 1 DS vs. Joe Gianetti’s WYS<br/>
<br/>
ANOTHER FREAKIN’ WYS deck?  this thing is a freakin’ plague!  so i go to his tatooine system on turn 2 with thrawn and 3 pilots on thunderflare.  i beat down lando on the ground (i think) and then i just kinda sit there in space and do nothing for awhile while i get him down to about 15 cards.  he is starting to retrieve despite my secret plans, so i take luke to the emperor and turn him.  this is the FIRST TIME I TURNED LUKE IN A TOURNAMENT!!! i almost did it against brentson on friday but i screwed up.  oh well.<br/>
<br/>
2 (+8)<br/>
<br/>
game 2 LS vs. Brad Augsburger’s flipping COTVG w/scum<br/>
<br/>
i played this deck all last year at the cons and i know exactly how to beat it.  3x it’s a trap.  heh.  he comes for the beatdown and "IT’S A TWAP!" he comes for the beatdown AGAIN and guess what?  "IT’S A TWAP" and then i drain him out in space for alot at kessel and coruscant.  uneventful game.  i do remember EPP obi wan sitting at the cantina by himself for a LONG TIME.<br/>
<br/>
4 (+30)<br/>
<br/>
game 3 DS vs. Duncan Hwang’s WYS<br/>
<br/>
AGAIN i am dismayed to see this objective.  2nd turn i drop a star destroyer w/3 pilots to tatooine system, and sit there the whole game.  i put out battle deployment and go to both tatooine docking bays with walkers + pilots, then drop "fighters coming in" and pull a drain of 6 for 2 full turns. he’s dropping in force very quickly.  he never really recovers, and i think i won this by beating bousch up for like 10...but i don’t remember.<br/>
<br/>
6 (+58)<br/>
<br/>
game 4 LS vs. David Irvine’s MKOS scum fortress<br/>
<br/>
so this is the exact same game we had the day before, but instead of things going really slow, he got all his sh1t out on turn 2, and i got EVERY SYSTEM OUT on turn 2 as well.  they were all activated in my opening 5 force except for 1.  weird.  so i’m doing pretty good until he drops Fett in S1 to coruscant with xizor/drE+PBaba for forfeit.  i track a 6 and try to remove them, but to no avail.  at this point he’s got way too much forfeit on S1 and i can’t break him in space to keep him paying for battle plan.  this is the game right here, and he eventually drains me out after grabbing OTE, and i can’t seem to draw one of my 3 OMDH.  pretty much what i’d expected from this game, and i lose by 18.<br/>
<br/>
6 (+40)<br/>
<br/>
at this point in the day, lingrell is freaking out because he has a flight to catch, so he and irvine jump in my car and i drive them to the airport in ten minutes flat.  my car is BROKEN POWER!!!  (it’s a honda...gimme’ a break).<br/>
<br/>
i get back and find out that Team Old Man Secret Squirrel has won (that’s me, lingrell, chris hunter).<br/>
<br/>
well woopadeedoo...we won, and i lost AGAIN to irvine’s scum.  i’ll definitely have to rethink my decks and put some work into it if i want to push into top 4 in vegas, but all in all i consider it a good weekend.<br/>
<br/>
thanks to everyone for coming out, and i hope you all had a good time...i know i did.  and to Brian Hunter:  where were you man?  i know Van said you don’t like to travel alone, so i’m assuming that noone else wanted to go with you?  or did something else come up?  i had a camera all ready for when jesus walked into my store...heh.<br/>
<br/>
later<br/>
