<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Pre-Enduro:<br/>
After my large tournament last weekend, I was pumped for Enduro.  For the last Enduro (in July 2000; the first one held), I had driven a party to the location in Modesto; this time around, Steve Daniel had his turn bringing myself and my little brother Alex to the event in Roseville.  I had wanted to bring multiple decks to Enduro, and went spelunking in my old DeckMaker files.  I happened upon the gem of the files: CPI Navy.  I went through all the versions I had made, and decided that this would be a fun deck to play.  I made v3.0 out, and then tried to think of a new LS deck that wasn’t WYS or HB mains (since EVERYONE plays those).  Wednesday evening, after slaving on the computer playing Ultima Online, I came up with a deck no one would expect to see: RTP.  That’s right, folks, Rescue The Princess.  I made the deck, left holes for cards I’d need to borrow/acquire, and on Friday, took Greyhound from Santa Cruz to Los Gatos, then rollerbladed for 50 minutes to my parent’s house.  The next morning, at 5am, I awoke, showered, packed some food and caffeine, and at 6:30, drove (w/ a sleepy brother) to meet Steve at his house.  We left at 7am, and since Steve never let the speedometer drop below 80mph, we arrived 2 hours early.  We hung out, met people as they arrived, then after registration, at approximately 12pm, and with around 40 people in attendance, Mike Hardy began the pairings.<br/>

The Tournament:<br/>
<br/>
My decks:<br/>
LS - All For Her - mains with insanely high destiny draws<br/>
DS - CPI Navy v3.0 - blow away every system on table, and lockdown the win with Ability, Ability, Ability<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS v. Robert Selby’s WYS<br/>
He looked at my start, and asked where SYCFA was.  I told him I don’t use that, and that he would get to go first (how broken does that make WYS?).  I got to my usual slow start, while he flipped fast.  Strategic Reserves staved off his drains.  2nd turn, EPP Vader went to the Cantina to clean Talon and Wedge’s clocks, but a 0 + 1 on the swing and a 0 for battle destiny ended that hope real fast.  I let him do his thing after that, and set up A Day Long Remembered on Yavin 4, which went off successfully the following turn.  Two turns later, Tatooine disappeared and he flipped back.  AAA did its magic from there.<br/>
Result: FW +28<br/>
Standing: 2(+28)<br/>
Good Things: Perfect.<br/>
Bad Things: EPP Vader sucking it hard.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: Robert is a fun guy, and we played in a fun fashion after that.  Once I blew everything away, he sped through his turns so as to be done with the game as fast as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS v. Luke Chang’s Hunt Down<br/>
8D8 and a Lift Tube freed Leia fast, but IG-88 With Riot Gun came down and recapped her.  Vader came out, but EPP Obi beat him away; when Vader returned, EPP Luke followed his mentor’s path (canceling Search And Destroy in the process).  Corran and Wedge Red Squad Leader cancelled Visage; a retaliatory force of 4-LOM w/ and Grand Admiral Thrawn saw him and Wedge die; Corran received some backup next turn and the Holotheatre was held for the rest of the game.  I spread out on Executor, On The Edge-d Corran for 5 and 3, and drained him out.<br/>
Result: FW +28<br/>
Standing: 4(+56)<br/>
Good Things: Won w/o flipping.<br/>
Bad Things: The deck hurts bad for Force generation; a problem I attempted to address all day.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: When you run out of Vaders in a Hunt Down deck, there’s not much else you can do; the support characters were able to hold their own, though.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS v. Kevin Shannon’s ISB<br/>
I know I’m f**ked right off the bat, since I know the essence of Kevin’s deck.  Among his start is Secret Plans, which owns RTP.  He flipped first turn by taking over Yavin 4.  ¼ way, I freed Leia, and was able to flip.  My mains came down to hold Yavin 4, and to drain.  He dropped more sites, and drained me out big.<br/>
Result: FL -18<br/>
Standing: 4(+38)<br/>
Good Things: Only losing by 19.  Vader, Palpy, and some ISB agents went OOP courtesy of my flipped objective.<br/>
Bad Things: Not having enough Force to pay for Death Star Plans.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: As always, a great game and a great player.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS v. Salvador Placensia’s WYS<br/>
More WYS.  He flipped fast, while I suffered a slower-than-normal start.  He massed guys at the Home One DB for most of earlygame, paying for Battle Order constantly, then finally moved over.  I finally got on track, and blew away Hoth setting ADLR.  Tatooine went away next, and Kessel succumbed a turn later.   AAA lockdown.<br/>
Result: FW +29<br/>
Standing: 6(+67)<br/>
Good Things: Perfect.<br/>
Bad Things: None.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: He played it well, despite some odd early deployment choices.<br/>
<br/>
So, I go 3-1 for the First Quarter.  We get an hour break, and I just sit around and watch fun games played.<br/>
