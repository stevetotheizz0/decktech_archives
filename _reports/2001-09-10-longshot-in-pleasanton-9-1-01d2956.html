<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">TR straight outta Warmasters in Pleasanton in the good old Bay<br/>
Area of California.  I had just got into San Francisco (after<br/>
having spent the summer in Southern Cal) and I decided to head<br/>
to the tourney to see some old faces.  It was good seeing<br/>
everyone again.  Two players I must give props to right away are<br/>
Kyle Ishimaru and Paul McKelvey.  These 2 players were in the<br/>
low 1800s when I left and now both are rated in the 2000s!  Kyle<br/>
is #3 in Alderaan now, so props go to him.  Props to Alfred for<br/>
still being THAT DAMN GOOD and props to Nick and Steve for <br/>
runnign tournies all this time and still doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Dark side is a seante deck, light side is TIGIH.  Both decks <br/>
have antiracing, since that was pretty big in SoCal, I assumed<br/>
the same for here in NoCal.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS v Adrian’s Court (POTH, MP/YCHF, TINT/OE)<br/>
<br/>
He uses POTH to pull Boelo and puts him and Televan (the alien<br/>
who deploys for zero and cancels Beggar) to the AC.  I deploy<br/>
Orrimaarko to the SArlacc Pit and move Luke to the Endor DB.<br/>
He drains and gets Mara out from reserve using the AC text.<br/>
He sets up a big drain in the AC with Gailid, POTF, and Mara w/<br/>
saber.  I setup drains at the Pit, Endor DB (w/Luke’s saber), <br/>
&amp; Tatooine DB.  So were’re both draining for 4.  He’s losing<br/>
his ships to drains so I deploy Kessel and put the Radiant VII<br/>
there with her 2 pilots aboard.<br/>
<br/>
Now I’m ahead in drains.  I also draw a Control, so I cancel his<br/>
only drain then I deploy Ounee Ta to get the Control back and <br/>
play it again next turn.  He spreads to the Dungeon to drain but<br/>
Lando w/ Ax and Chewie make an appearance, but I draw like crap<br/>
and dont get to stack a card.  But I do clear the site.  So the<br/>
game ends in a drain with only 1 battle all game, and no cards <br/>
stacked.  Win by 29.  2 (+29).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Getting that Kessel drain.<br/>
Worst: Kinda boring without battles.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS v Kyle Ishimaru’s WYS racing<br/>
<br/>
I flash Anakin’s pod with Sebulba and flip 1st turn with Lott <br/>
Dod and the senator who allows only 1 destiny at BG sites.  I<br/>
deploy Maul to his site for free and move him to the Arena.  He<br/>
just draws, and on my turn he draws bad for race destiny (5,2,1 <br/>
I believe).  So we’re going along and I’ve finally got Maul at<br/>
the Tat DB to drain for 3 thanks to Motion Supported.  I don’t<br/>
draw a whole lot of characters, except Senators, and I am using<br/>
Lott Dod to fetch my Pod Collisions.  Han &amp; Luke come out and get<br/>
in a few beatdowns, but I have all 4 political effects on table<br/>
so I can swing any battle by 6 (add 3 to my draw, subtract 3 from <br/>
their draw).<br/>
<br/>
The race is almost over, we both draw our destiny and I have 30 to<br/>
his 29, so I win the race, and that pretty much seals the game.<br/>
However, I have Tarkin and a Coruscant Guard at a site and Kyle<br/>
deploys EPP Luke and a smuggler to hit Tarkin and make him lost<br/>
using SATM/BP from lost pile and I take 11 battle damage.  Ouch.<br/>
Then i drain him out for the win by 24.  4 (+53).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Winning the race.<br/>
Worst: Luke beating down a poor Coruscant guard<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS v Alfred Dong’s PodProfit<br/>
<br/>
I dont start any aliens in the AC to guard Han.  I just deploy<br/>
Maul and pull Lott using Phantom menace.  Then I deploy Tikkes<br/>
and flip.  I stalled Anakin’s Pod, of course.  He drops Qui-Gon<br/>
in the AC but doesnt free Han yet.  After I’ve drained a bit, he<br/>
frees Han to retrieve.  I play a Pod Collision, he plays Too Close<br/>
For Comfort, so I sense, and end up losing a SAC war so my <br/>
collision is lost and all my Sense &amp; Alters are in my used pile<br/>
now, while he’s probably got more in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
He plays Step backwards a couple times, but luckily for me we are<br/>
tied 4 times throughout the race (at 0, 15, 19, and 20) so I get<br/>
to stall Anakin each time.  But I cant get a collision through.<br/>
Meanwhile he’s only hitting me for 1 force per turn due to Profit<br/>
damage (I cancel his drain).  He spreads later to increase the <br/>
Profit damage to 2.  He’s got a few twix sites out so he’s <br/>
activating a good amount.  Then the race ends when he has 26 to<br/>
my 25, so I play my last Pod collision, expecting a sense or Too<br/>
Close for Comfort but he has nothing so I remove a 5 and win the<br/>
race 25 to 21.  That ends the game.  Win by 18.  6 (+71).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Winning the race.<br/>
Worst: No battles<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS v Alex Stefanko’s Senate deck <br/>
<br/>
He flips 2nd turn while I drain and move Luke to the Endor DB.  <br/>
He sets up weakly in the Senate, so I challenge him in there with<br/>
Mas, Sei, and Yarua (Bacta Tank on table).  So I kill some Senators<br/>
before he reinforces the Senate and kicks me out of there for good.<br/>
But it did keep him from using his senator’s text (especially Lott)<br/>
and Yarua is so cool since he -2 from a wealth senator’s politics<br/>
to keep him from having a majority.  Like I said though, my 3 guys<br/>
only held out so long before they died and I redeployed them else-<br/>
where (using the Tank).<br/>
<br/>
Ben and Qui-gon showed up at my Tat DB, but Dr E and 2 battle droids<br/>
showed up, 1 with a blaster.  He shot and operated on Ben (damn <br/>
senators are +2 or +3 destiny), and beatdown Qui-gon with a 9 destiny<br/>
draw (droid rifle is destiny 6 then he added 3 to it).  I finally get<br/>
rid of Dr E but the droids hold out against me with his high destiny.<br/>
This game goes to time, my 20 to his 16.  I don’t get to stack any <br/>
cards.  Later he showed how he normally draws destiny of 11 each draw<br/>
using a droid blaster (destiny 6) then having An Entire Legion of my<br/>
Best Troops (+2 to blaster rifle destiny), then adds 3 using his <br/>
effect.  Pretty nasty.  Then he also used Inconsequential Losses so<br/>
he just forfeited a rifle to his used pile to satisfy attrition on me.<br/>
Just sick.  Timed win by 20.  7 (+91).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Putting up a fight in the Senate.<br/>
Worst: No cards stacked.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS v Paul McKelvey’s No Money, No Parts deck<br/>
<br/>
He owned me this game.  1st turn he drops Vader to endor DB,<br/>
Televan to Mos Espa, and Watto to Junkyard, I lose 2 force.  I have<br/>
nothinh to counter with, so i just move Luke over and draw.  he <br/>
drains, I lose 2 more to his objective, he drops Zuckuss in MH to the<br/>
Tat system (he deployed) and drops Tat Occupation.  I could’ve cried.<br/>
Now I’m losing a bunch of force and its only the 3rd turn.  I get Ben<br/>
and Qui-Gon to Mos Espa, and he moves Xizor and Maul over from the<br/>
junkyard.  He drops Emp to backup Vader and I move Qui and Ben to the<br/>
junkyard.  I’m drawing all my red like my racing interrupts and the<br/>
characters I do draw are sucky ones like the Radiant VII pilots and <br/>
senators.  My deck just sucks vs Watto because Watto deck goes too<br/>
fast for me.  I battle at the junkyard to end the game and he plays<br/>
Maul Strikes and I have you now plus Watto’s cube and draws a bunch<br/>
of destiny.  Lose by 25.  7 (+66).<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS v Paul’s WYS racing (starts Insight/Staging)<br/>
<br/>
I draw no characters opening hand, AND no pod collisions.  I do draw<br/>
Zuckuss in MH though.  I draw, he flips in space with Mirax and Theron<br/>
in their ships to Kessel and Tat.  I kill Mirax w/ Zuckuss and draw,<br/>
looking for Maul.  He’s way ahead in the race by the time I draw a<br/>
Maul, still havent drawn a collision (4 in the deck).  He’s already<br/>
played 2 step backwards on me, and he’s at like 18 while I’m at 7.<br/>
So I go for the drains, I finally flip and am draining for good <br/>
amounts thanks to Motion Supported.  But he gets Menace fades going<br/>
and now I’m hurting.  He wins the race, and now he’s retrieving due<br/>
to I Did It!  That’s the reason I play antiracing, not because of the<br/>
12 force swing, but because I Did It is a killer.<br/>
<br/>
But I’m still canceling his drains so he’s not doing much damage to <br/>
me.  But then he kills me off in space and has Battle Plan on table,<br/>
so I’m done.  His retrieval plus my having to pay for drains means<br/>
he can come back big time, so i draw up to prevent him from getting a<br/>
lot of force back.  Lose by 2.  7 (+64).<br/>
<br/>
Best: None really, except canceling a LOT of his drains.<br/>
Worst: Losing the race, losing in space.<br/>
<br/>
Paul goes undefeated, Alfred takes 2nd.  I end up in 7th I think.<br/>
I’m running a tourney on Sept 15th in Pleasanton, so I hope you all<br/>
who can show up will show up.  thanks for reading.<br/>
