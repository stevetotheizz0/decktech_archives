<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok, well this is my second tourney ever, and my second TR ever, so please be generous :-)<br/>
<br/>
i kinda forget the details of the games, but ill do my best.<br/>
<br/>
****Pre-Tourney Junk****<br/>
We’ll,  I headed over to John’s house at about noon, since the tourney started at 2pm, and his dad was VERY ULTRA GENEROUS TO DRIVE US BOTH WAYS. Thanks Mr. B :-) <br/>
	We had a little extra time till we were going to leave, so we busted out our decks, I took darkside, and won by like 20 or so, so he ditched that deck and took his ’roids deck, which sucked later on. We had 20 minutes left till we leave after the game, so we bust out the Raw Deal, i take THE ROCK, and he gets Triple H. Of course Triple H pulls of the win because he is the best and everyone loves him. Stupid Triple H.<br/>
	The ride down was pretty uneventful, except his sister had the backstreet boys or n*suck on or something, so that annoyed me until we made her have it only come out of one speaker haha. we talked about decks, and how harvest is good, and that he needs to buy his own raw deal deck and stop using my own HHH against me.<br/>
	We got there a little early, and Mike was all set up on his laptop, so john ran downstairs and bought a man kind, i bought 2 boosters, and we played a little. my new not a chance in hell was awesome, and i stomped a mudhole in him with my triple H, which john formerly used. but the pairings interrupted, and my win was unoffical<br/>
****End Pre-Tourney Junk****<br/>
<br/>
Decks<br/>
DS: Admirals Orders abuse Hunt Down. it duels w/o epic duel, as a surprize hehe<br/>
LS: WYS Harvest w/ Ralltiir Freighter Cappys<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My DS vs Barrett (forgot your last name, sorry bud) 1400-1500 (? not sure, may be higher)’s EBO w/ japanese hoth sites<br/>
<br/>
well, this game was pretty quick, but not as fast as johns first game. i got vader down second turn, with his saber and was draining for 2 about the whole game, never contested, except once when EPP obi came down, and got his @#$% dueled, for a big surprize to Barrett. He had problems finding his all your base are now secret and belong to us, so he didnt get EBO up till late game, after I had bossk in tooth, and zuckuss with ECC 4-lom and ECC iggy aboard for 4 destinys. he had kiffex out, and i had rendili, and we basically chased back and forth, until my drains of 3 and 4 (everyother turn) wore him down. visage went down fast, but i didnt care, thats now what this deck is about. in the end, i out drained him after not battling or having him drain. pretty uneventful now that i think about it.<br/>
FW +19<br/>
2(+19)<br/>
<br/>
highs: winning my 5th ever tourney game, making me 3-2 :-)<br/>
lows: him not finding all your base are belong to us, and me winning because of it<br/>
<br/>
well, im in forth now, since john won in 13 minutes, with a dif of 40. he was using MY trooper deck, cause his DS stunk. it was against a new guy (who seemed pretty cool) who left a rebel guard all alone...he had it coming! Zeq and someone else were beating me in dif, with Zeq having 38 dif.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My LS vs Barrett’s (again, ack) Court <br/>
<br/>
playing the same guy twice sucks, but im pretty confident going into this game. he sets up mara and saber for a quick drain of 2 in the chamber, but i get out dash and some RFCs to get menace fades rolling, and cut that drain to 1. a quick check for a dbay first turn shows nothing, so he gets to see my deck.. hurray, just what i need. but i get down some scrubs for quick drains, while he is draining me for one a whole lot, compared to my one or two, but my harvests get back about 12 force for me before owen and beru kick it to an attack with the barge. i have to starting running between dbays with two RFCs, to avoid a giant beatdown crew that hurt owen beru and luke and made me loose a few. i get in some drains here and there, and he battles once or twice, and ALWAYS forgets to retrieve with scum, which makes all the difference in the world. eventually time is called, and my running must stop. i get in a last second harvest for two, and try to recycle some, but cant. we count up, my 20 to his 18. mwahaha, those 8 or so he should have retrieved cost him, and my last second 2 win it.<br/>
TW +20<br/>
3(+39)<br/>
<br/>
highs: winning...barely<br/>
lows: timed winning. times suck<br/>
<br/>
haha, john lost his second game, and all the rest of them too. really sucks for him, but its all good cause he gets good support in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 DS vs Jason McSherry’s (high 1600s) WYS with RFC and all the classic stuff<br/>
<br/>
wow, i suck. this game is a prime example. last tourney, i played jason, and beat him in a timed, because his deck wasnt complete, so this was our rematch. in the beginning, i get some quick drains of 2, and he loses celebration off the top. YAY! he drops jedi luke, and i duel him with choke vader and saber (non epic). i think he was caught off guard. i get THE CRAPPIEST DRAW EVER of a 4 and a 2, compared to his 5 and 3. there are 13 AOs in this deck, plus lots of other 5s and 6s. great, vader dies, and i lose 6, he retrieves 6. later on we remember that he cant subtract 3 cause its epic duel that trys to cross him, and that would have been a few less force for him, and would have made a bit of a difference, but thats life. luckily, vader is just lost, not OOP, so i drop another vader next turn (with saber, yay) and continue to forget visage, which isnt bad, cause my OBJ is outta play. towards the end, i rememberd it, but he just OOC’d it immeadiately, oh well, i didnt care much, the deck doesnt need it. he beats down on me a whole bunch, and i barely live through most of it. my monnok turns up nothing, and my ships are no where. except my zuckusses, who decided to show up atleast 3 or 4 times for double destinys of 1, great. bossk sits alone until he gets pounded in space a little later, cause i forgot about outriders text. bah. my drains of 2 in the cantina with guri and empy go on for a while, until he moves han lando and luke over. he battles, and tries to get 3 destiny, and i tap guri, he reads, and isnt too happy. i get a 6 for BD (ABOUT TIME!) and win by a few, so he loses han to tank, and brings him back next turn. i decide to just draw up, because he is just retreiving and im not hurting him. after he told me that he had a few off the edges ready, lol. and dont give this a 4, mick, or ill return the favor haha<br/>
FL -14<br/>
3(+25)<br/>
<br/>
highs: finally playing a REAL game against Jason, since last time his deck was incomplete<br/>
lows: bad destiny! bad destiny! BAD DESTINY!!!<br/>
<br/>
first loss, oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My LS vs Johnny B’s (sub 1500) Trooper deck that is mine<br/>
<br/>
yay, i drive 45 mins to play my best friend who i play everday, oh, and hes borrowing my trooper deck, perfect!<br/>
<br/>
i know this is a tough one, since he’ll POUND me if i deploy on the ground. first turn, he draws, and i get dash on the rider, that will hold since he has no space in the deck. the dash draining for one all game was key. i had RFCs running around, as well as luke and chewie to get in drains where i could, and avoid the wrath of vader and 20 troopers. at one point, 3 RFCs, wedge and chewie get nailed with vader, 15 troopers, and dark jedi prescense, and trooper assault. i grab trooper assault later on, so that screws him. i end up losing all my guys, and a few force (thank you insurrection and my OBJ), and he has 15 stranded troopers, which elis around, or atleast try to. i avoid the wrath a few more times, and actually beat vader and his posse in 2 or 3 battles, which turns the tide. i get harvest (via owen/beru in the outrider) going to retrieve atleast 14 force, since his deck had no retrieval protection.  i do manage to get in a few drains of 3 here and there with a definite drain of 1 the whole time. he forgot to drain about 10 or 15 times, which would have saved him a whole lot of trouble.<br/>
FW +18<br/>

post tourney junk<br/>
<br/>
well, johns dad was nice and took us to McDonalds, and me and john both got milkshakes and that 2 for $2 chicken nuggets thing. mmm nuggets. we played some raw deal in the restaurant, and my HHH beat the crap out of his mankind, althought it was only because i pulled a non reversable leaping knee to the face, with i am the game on table. he had 14 cards left, you do the math. he had a tree of woe in hand, so i would have been dead next turn, but thats the way it goes, TRIPLE H WINS!<br/>
<br/>
after that, we went back to johns house, played a game of SWCCG, i won, hehe, and then i had to go home, cause it was sunday :-(<br/>
<br/>
