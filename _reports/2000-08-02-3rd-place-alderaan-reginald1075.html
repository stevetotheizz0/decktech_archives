After comicon, i wasnt sure if i was going to be going to reginals, but i was playtesting a lot anyways. I hade a few LS decks made but none of them did any good, so i just played a There is good in him scout deck.<br/>
<br/>
The Decks:<br/>
<br/>
LS: There is good in him, starts strike planning, staging areas, and insurrection. Pull a 1/0 docking bay and stick madine there and get lots of force activation, and pull out my scouts, i had 3 clouds for ralltiir and a total of 8 ships.<br/>
<br/>
DS: Ralltiir ops, starting mobile points, IAO, and oppressive. Ill pulle weekimui (sp) and 1/0 docking bays and stick a scrub there to get the activation. I had the emp and his goons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, LS vs Ken's Raithal Ops.<br/>
He starts the objective and bad feeling have i. First turn i pull the Home 1 docking bay and drop madine and panno for back up. His turn he just draws and drops like 6 sites. My second turn i activate 14 force and deploy Home 1 to raithal (thought he might be playing numbers or something).<br/>
He drops op and vader at one site and an op and a guy at another. I pull my second general, solo, and pull COK with madine and send them at vader and op, and send obi at the other pair, and clear both sites. He drops some lone ops and 3 sites, not knowing he cant drain. i have a drain of 8 going and i soon drain him out.<br/>
<br/>
2(+33)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: winning and a very fun game, for me atleast.<br/>
Lows: none for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, DS vs Clayton Atkin's Throne Room<br/>
He starts the throne room and i start rops. It was slow in he beginging both of us just drawing cards. Then he grimtashes me and drops 2 guys at the throne room, and civil disorder. So on my turn i draw and save. Next turn i lay out 3 sites and and drop Fett in slave 1 to Ralltiir and Flip. I battle in space and he has huge attrition. We keep battling in space for a while till i drop bossk in bus and zuckis (sp) in mist hunter and lat damage the falcon, he losses it all and some. All the game he has been draining me for one at the carbo chamber. So i drop lord vader with his stick and he barriers, next turn he drops han and luke and battles, misses both swings and i hit han i draw a 4 total but i have to lose vader.I keep on draing on ralltiir while he is OCCing everything in my lost pile, emperor, vaders stick and like 6 other cards. I drop kashyyyk and move my ships over to get in my free drains.<br/>
<br/>

Game 3, DS vs Somebody's Ebo<br/>
He starts ebo, i start rops. First turn we both draw. second turn he draws, as do i. i monnok him used and get ebo in the used pile but he didnt catch it and searches for a system with ANSB and goes to deploy ebo but doesnt have it so has to wait a turn. On my turn i flip and play searh and destroy. He drops ebo and drops a whole bunch of ships. My turn i drain and grab a ship and battle, but it does nothing cus he has so many ships. He spreads out in space and drains me while i drain on the ground. <br/>

Game 5, DS vs Pual Todd Feldman's HB<br/>
He starts hidden base and 3 effects, i start rops. i drop security precautions and a 2/0 first turn and draw while he drops systems and draws.I had to keep my hand below 12 in fear of a grimtash. He controls ralltiir with a lot of ships, so i have to save a tone of force to flip.Finaly i flip with vader, mara and a tempest scout to 3 sites and bossk to the system. He slips and i probe ralltiir with bossk and kessel with fett. he battles bossk annd power pivots him, not knowing i have security precuations on table, and i just lose a scrub on hound's tooth to attrition<br/>
he drops a lone tantive to kessel to drain, i drop chimaera and lateral damage and battle, and hit it up for 8 cards. that was game right there.<br/>

Game 6, Jason Set your course deck<br/>
I drop han and some scout to try to win a battle but he barriers han and next turn snipers him and you are beatins one of my scouts and and beats the other one for 17 cards, so that is game right there but i try to come back and make him lose as much cards as i can by putting a ship and redili and a ship in a clouds i deployed there, and a ship at the death star, (he had CHYBC out). but it was not enough and i lose by 19.<br/>
<br/>
10(+78)<br/>
<br/>
So i finish 3rd just a few cards out of the final. but i had a really fun time and came in third. Inm between rounds and after the tournament i played a few games against eric field and some starter deck games with kevin shannon, which were really fun.<br/>
