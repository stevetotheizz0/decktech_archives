Pre-Tourney<br/>
<br/>
So its the Saturday before the tournament, I go to see my boss. He’s who I work for. I work at Loblaws. Loblaws is a place that sells food. A lot of people would also call Loblaws a supermarker and/or grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
Eric to boss: I need this weekend off.<br/>
<br/>
Boss: No , I need you to work.<br/>
<br/>
Eric: My cousin is getting married, I have to go.<br/>
<br/>
Boss: You can go to the afterparty , I need you at work.<br/>
<br/>
Eric: Ok.<br/>
<br/>
(Eric proceeds to storm to the next aisle, where he demolishes a display of Pokemon related school material.)<br/>
<br/>
Ok so lying to my boss that there was my cousins wedding on the day of the DPC didn’t work. So I was pretty much ready to sacrifice my job for cards. Thankfully, one of my co-workers decided to do my a huge favor and work my shift for the Saturday, which was amazing.<br/>
<br/>
So I playtest all week with a Profit Podracing deck, that is pretty good, but every other game I can’t seem to get the destiny going. My dark was Avatar’s Huntdown, which is one of my favorite decks, but I found it to be weak to sold WYS decks, so I thought to myself, what about Imperial Court. Imperial Court was one of my old decks that I had good sucess with until they invented Don’t Do THat Again<br/>
<br/>
On Friday, I show up to Alex Klammrodt’s house. Alex is my mentor. Alex has taught me a lot about the game. Alex has invited some people from Boston to go to DPC with. Among these people are H20 Justin Desai, Cody , Klema and some other guy. I can’t believe I am not sure about their names, but whatever, I wasn’t sleeping much that week.<br/>
<br/>
We playtest at Klammrodt’s shack. Man that place is dispicable. Whatever, at least he doesn’t live with his parents like I do. So I manage to lose to his QMC deck , and I lost the rece to Desai’s HD by 1. I make my Profit higher destiny with some Out of Commisions and Double agent, and I’m set.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5 am the next morning. I awaken. Sprawled across the floor are the corpses of 4 Bostonians. I finish my decks and later greet my little brother who’s fresh off of a 6 and 0 performance at the last local. We take the bus downtown.<br/>
<br/>
It was pretty amusing watching these Americans attempt to board the bus. They’re trying to stuff ones down a coin slot and it takes them about 5 minutes to actually proceed to their seats, where I had been observing the entertaining incident. I don’t think the bus driver could speak English either.<br/>
<br/>
We are walking down St-Joseph street, and after about 2000 addresses we arrive to this community center. Where we are greeted by medium Twigg. My first impression of this guy is that he’s injected himself with pure sugar and proceeded to eat a handful of speed pills. In other words, he’s really hyper. But freaking funny.<br/>
<br/>
We enter this community center and we follow the "Deck Tech" signs to this room. I was expecting to see a mass of 60-80 people, but there are more like 30. Not really that surprising considering the entree was 40 bucks Canadian. I don’t think many scrubs were willing to dish that down for Clint Hays or Yannick ot win. I walk around after filling my decklist. I meet Mike Gemme, who lends me some cards. For the past month I’ve had this grudge vs. the guy since I accused him of copying and posting Avatar’s QMC, but he turned out to be a great guy, and he had some fukking funny stories to tell about Steve Baroni’s mom, which are well detailed in his tournament report. OMG that shiat is funny.<br/>
<br/>
So I expecting to get paired against some scrub for game 1 since my rating is like less than 1600.  I hear Max Brian call: "Matt Sokol vs. Eric George". Oh well, I have to play the world Champ, not some scrub.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : Eric George Imperial Court vs. Matt Sokol’s Pile on Tatooine<br/>
<br/>
 To me, this was a great game from the start. I am not sure if I started Mob Points, but whatever. I deploy Arican in the chamber to satisfy court. He drops Qui Gon first turn with Saber, he also revolutions my Executer DBay Next turn, I use my Always Thinking with Your Stomach to make Qui missing and on my next turn, I No Escape for it, and I have another one in my hand. I am saving force for many turns. At one point I deployed U-3PO, EPP Vader and 4-Lom to beat on Threepio and Shmi for 12 overflow. He found his missing characters and started draining in the cantina. I know I monnoked the first revolution, but later he deployed like 2 more. I freaking deployed like 3 systems and started draining, my I Have You Nows won me the game.<br/>
<br/>
FW by 11<br/>
<br/>
Highs: You know what the High is.<br/>
Lows: I can’t stop smiling and I don’t want Matt to feel liek @#$%, cause I am rated something really damn low.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Eric George Profit vs. Pat Dinelle’s Brangus<br/>
<br/>
Dinelle is one of my favorite guys to play, he is really fun and I admire his good sportsmanship and his win against cancer. He was inflicting a lot of damage vs. himself with the Dark Path but I ASB most of his race destinies. I sensed and Too Closed the race interrupts, and I think he lost all his Branguses. Pat has never drawn up, so he let me win the race and retrieve with I Did It, then I got some more back with On The Edge. The Profit damage did him in.<br/>
<br/>
FW by 26<br/>
<br/>
Highs: THe Profit deck is supposed to win vs. Brangus.<br/>
Lows: Beating a fellow Quebecer.<br/>
<br/>
So I am now 2 and 0, so this means I’ll be playing someone good. My prediction is correct.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Eric George Imperial Court vs. Clint Hays Solid WYS<br/>
<br/>
Clint was wearing the same hat as me. WTF. I was calm for some reason but I played like a @#$%ing moron. ALl he did was but Jedi Luke in the cantina with saber and Mirax at Kessel. I did jack and stayed at Tatooine. He on the Edged twice to boost his differential. Oh yeah, he Grimtashed my 2 EPP Vaders away. Which left with with a handful of I Have You Nows and Force Fields. This is one of those games where you just get schooled, and with good reason. The guy played like a machine.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: At one point I tracked a 6 with OAP!!!<br/>
Lows: The grimtassh hurt worse than I thought it would.<br/>
<br/>
FL by 31<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My Profit vs. Chris Fanchi’s DS Senate no Hand Destruction.<br/>
<br/>
This guy is a pretty good player. This was my first game against senate and I thought I had a good chance with all my direct damage. He deployed every single Political effect. I rescued Han. He killed han, twice I think. I ASB for Han , but he died again I think. The race was what saved me from taking another beating as bad as Clint had just dealt me.<br/>
I had bad luck in this game. At one point I drew a 0 to Lost in the Wilderness Palpy, and later I run Luke Runed into a battle that would probably win me the game, but I missed my slash, so he just lost Vader. I also never had Dodge or Narrow Escape.<br/>
<br/>
FL by 20<br/>
<br/>
Highs: My first experience against Senate.<br/>
Lows: Bad Luck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Eric George Profit vs. Greg Hodur’s Brangus.<br/>
<br/>
He loses his first card from hand. Its Brangus. I out of commision it. He was doing me absolutely no damage even though he won the race without the box. I was doing him 2 Profit Damage and 2 in drains every turn for almost the entire game. All sections helped him big. This is kinda the part where I realized I really should have played with the new Grabber. But I’m an idiot. So lets continue to my third round of Bad Luck. He gets the ROC combo. I on the edge to cancel it. He gets Much Anger back with No Escape. He gets the ROC combo on me again. I alter it, but it goes to his used cause he has Oppressive. He gets the ROC combo. He wins.<br/>
<br/>
FL by something pretty standard like 15-20<br/>
Highs: OOC Brangus<br/>
Lows: ROC Combo and forgetting to stick in the perma grabber.<br/>
<br/>
Next game: My Imperial Court vs. some really freaky guy with eye shadow’s WYS racing.<br/>
<br/>
I set up Arica in the AC. He activates, does nothing for like 15 minutes, then draws. I was really bored this game. Nothing was happening. We had some battles where he lost his characters, and I lost my Vaders. I never established a good drain in space. He actually retrieved for the podrace. That was the first time that had ever happened against me.<br/>
Uhh, this was by far the most boring game of my life and I lost to the freaky guy with eye shadow by 11 or so.<br/>
<br/>
FL by 11 <br/>
<br/>
Highs: Umm getting the rest from his 20 minutes turn where he did nothing. Wait, no, something good did happen. I laughed at him when he surprised assaulted himself for 5 force.<br/>
<br/>
Lows: Having to sometimes look at him, it was seriously really frightening. I never should have lost this game.<br/>
<br/>
So Alex is pissed at me cause I am his apprentice and I scrubbin out. He is in the top and I wish him luck. He tells me to concentrate and win my next 2 games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 7: Eric George vs. THE GUY HE PLAYS ALMOST EVERY FREAKING DAY OF THE WEEK... HIS FREAKING BROTHER kevin george.<br/>
<br/>
We think of rigging the game. But whatever. We were pissed that we paid money to be paired vs. eachother. So we just screw around.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Absolutely nothing good happened during the 10 minutes that we completed this game in.<br/>
<br/>
Lows: WTF do u think.<br/>
<br/>
I win by 40, or so we reported.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8. My COurt vs. this guy from Quebec WYS.<br/>
<br/>
Ok so I forgot to activate first turn. I also forgot to force drain him once at kashhyk.<br/>
<br/>
I lost by 1........ 1<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Mostly everything went his way.<br/>
Lows: Playing like the ultimate scrub.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Avatar loses to Desai so he doesn’t get cash. I am not really happy with my performance. I did really learn a lot at my first big tournament so it is still a good experience. I was hindered by bad luck and my own mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
To the boyz from Massachussets who were chill all day.<br/>
<br/>
Mike Gemme. OMG I fukking laughed at his stories. Plus he was totally chill to talk to , even though he declined to trade the picture of his sister for anything.<br/>
<br/>
Big Twigg. That guy is the biggest maniac of them all and his TIE bomber deck that collapsed all the WYS sites + the Senate. I laughed at this guy’s comedy.<br/>
<br/>
Justin Desai. Nice going 5 and 3. I can’t wait for Dark Jedi Testing.<br/>
<br/>
Yannick. You got your revenge for a couple of bad placings at the last tournaments. You play like a machine, your dark deck was sick plus you are my hero for playing profit.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Pat Dinelle. COolest guy ever.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sokol. This guy’s chill.<br/>
<br/>
Hays. You fukkin schooled me. Plus you wore my hat. I’m buying a new one.<br/>
<br/>
Larry Lee: I know you’re reading this. Now get back into the game so we can own.<br/>
<br/>
I am not forgetting anyone but I have to rePROP GEmme’s stories.<br/>
