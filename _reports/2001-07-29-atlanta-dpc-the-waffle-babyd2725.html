<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">What a fun weekend it was!  So Ill start earlier off in the week.<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday/Thursday:<br/>
Ill give you the full names of everyone.  Carmine Arca, James Boyd, Arthur Rhodes, Landon Sommer, and I all got together at my house on Tuesday and Thursday for playtesting.  The decks were pretty basic.  For light side it was WYS with 8 Raiders, and for DS it was HD Racing which is the bomb.  But mine is different from other peoples for a couple reasons but I wont go into those now.  Matt Berta insisted on posting mine up, its like 5 cards different.  I gave it to him and he got second at the ComicCon with it.  But anyway, we playtested.  I swear I beat Arts dark side like 3-4 times in a row so I thought I would be ok.  And the decks performed solid.  I put Anis Racer, 3 A Srep Backwards, and one Too Close For Comfort into my LS deck because I know half the dark sides will be racing.  I know at least half of the LSs will be WYS.  So both my decks should pair up well against the meta.<br/>
<br/>
Friday:<br/>
Only Jim, Landon, Art, and I are going so Landon will be driving.  We get together and build Landon a Maul deck and talk about what well see.  Then we utilize them most important thing of all, Waffle House Tech!  For those of you that still rely on the Brownie, you best start switching over because the Waffle doesn&amp;#8217;t play around.  It even tastes good too.  Anyway, Landon and Jim spend the night and Art says he will be over by 6:45 in the morning so we can leave at 7.  I fill out my decklists and name my Dark deck:  That was Fast!  Not to be @#$%y or anything but it either loses really fast or wins really fast.  I am stupid and dont go to bed till one so I only get 6 hours of sleep.  Oh well, I got the Waffle and thats all that matters.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday:<br/>
I gotta do a little pre-tourney road-trip stuff so skip it if you want.  We wake up and start the drive and it was pretty funny.  We start singing random rap songs like Nothin But a G-Thing and stuff.  And then I bust out with the new Ludacris song Area Codes!  SEVE, SHREE, SHREE, ATE, FOE, FOE(7, 3, 3&amp;#8212; 8, 4, ,4)!.  It was pretty funny and Art tells me Im going to hell when I start listening to his Eminem stuff.  Landon and I get in another argument over Dave Matthews Band again.  Apparently he doesn&amp;#8217;t understand that they are one of the best bands EVER!  Oh well, Art keeps singing the Ludacris song.  Extremely hilarious, I tell him if I ever stack 7-3-3 for the podrace Ill stand up and scream it very loud just for him.  Unfortunately my DS has like only a couple threes and tends to draw sixes for the race.  My rating before the tourney was 2054 without a 4-0 in.  On to the tournament, here we GO!<br/>
<br/>
In case you missed it:<br/>
DS: HD Racing, no numbers.  About 5-10 cards off Matt Bertas version of mine.  Ill probably post mine soon though just because I made it anyway.  Biggest difference in mine is that I use EPPs instead of DLOTS.<br/>
LS: WYS Raiders, extremely balanced.  Control deck with heavy anti-racing package.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  My HD vs. Charlie Herrens(2086) Dagoboring Test to 5<br/>
<br/>
Blah!  The funny thing about this is that we played this match up at AugustaCon like 1 month ago and I won by 18.  But then again, he had racing in his deck then and now its test to 5.  So the game gets underway and he gets the anti-draw with Daughter in the opening hand.  I put the Emperor at my Holotheatre to protect Visage and add 2 to my activation.  And his first signal he pulls Honor because the three he spent contained his Traffic Control, that sucks.  So he pulls out Yodas Hutt and slaps a Yoda there.  We both have 20 cards in hand and he plays used grimtaash.  I dont care about a single card except the Its Worse Combo he put back.  I activate all and his first AFA pops but then I win the Podrace on the same turn. He spends 11 to It Could Be Worse the damage and I an like, DANG IT!  I am drawing big and setting up my hand as is he.  I put Vader and Mara with her stick at the Podrace Arena.  He finishes test 1 and puts down projection on the Arena to reduce my drain to 0.  While Honor reduces the Holotable drain to 0.  This is just great.  No Escape means I am doing 1 a turn through visage and not even activating any because my hand is set and I dont want to get hit by another Anger Fear.  So he finally finishes Test 5 with a Artoo in Red 5 stacked, Coward/Plans cancels the retrieval and makes both of his Edges useless.  But he  puts Quiggy at the Lower Corridor.  I Elis Vader and Mara over and battle him.  I hit him with 2 Masterful Moves and heres where I scrub out big time.  My power is 12 to his 13.  Instead of playing my Start Your Engines I draw blind and get a 1 so all he must lose is Quiggy while I lose Mara.  His turn he brings Obi and I have Circle and Focused Attack in hand but nothing tracked and a one near the top so I pass and we kill each other with him taking a couple on top of Obi.  Keep in mind Visage is still pinging through out the entire tmie.  I put draw one of my Mauls and pass.  He has like 7 left and puts Corran at the Lower Corridor and so I drop down Maul and kill him but no over flow and Visage finished him off.  He played a great game and we finished like 2 minutes left.  I can understand him drawing Daughter in opening hand and not getting test 1 off till turn 10 or so.  Rotten luck for him but there is nothing I can do.  I win by the same amount at AugustaCon, weird.  <br/>
<br/>
FW+18<br/>
Highs:  How come I never miss a hack on Quiggy?  I always seem to hit him and always seem to miss Melas!<br/>
Lows:  Test 1/Projection.  That sucked.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody from Augusta wins so we are starting off well.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My WYS vs. Arthur Rhodes(former 2000 player, 1864 now) Endor Ops Ties<br/>
Yep, I have to play Art game two.  That sucks big time.  Ive beaten him 4 times in a row so this should be no sweat right?!?!  Wrong.  I start Insurrection, Sqauassin, and Staging Areas.  My opening draw contains no ships, no pilots, and NO control/Tunnel Visions.  Well I really dont want to reveal a whole lot about his Dark Side so Ill summarize this game quickly.  He gets the best draw ever on top of my horrible opening hand.  By turn three my Cantina and Docking bay have been bombed up with perfect draws and U-3PO is sitting at my Generic docking bay.  GAME OVER, now all I go is run from his Ties and drain for one at the Home One DB with Lukes stick.  He grabbed my Edge but I played it twice to hold on for a little bit.  Sorry for any lack of detail.  Rotten luck took its toll on me but I wittled him down to 9.<br/>
<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;9<br/>
Highs:  None.<br/>
Lows:  Umm, I cant even deploy Celebration with only 1 Battleground on Tatooine.  Losing to Proton Bombs.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  My WYS vs. Brian Rippetoe(2114) SYC Brangus<br/>
Can I get an easy pairing or what?  LOL, Charlie, Art, and now Brian.  I met Brian before the tourney and hes a really nice guy.  He starts Box and I start the same old stuff with Anis Racer out.  He plays no grabber in his deck so I can play ASB 6 times and TCFComfort 2 times.  He moves for the Holotable.  He stalls me and stacks a Zuckuss in ship.  He drops the War Room and draws.  I drew one A Step B. in my opening hand so I get to save it for an oppurtune time.  It is critical for the first turn flip to cut his activation by 4 so I Tunnel Vision and drop my &lt;&gt;DB with a Raider and Craft, and put a lone Raider at DB:  94.  He stacks an EPP Vader while I stack a total of 7.  He pulls a DS DB and drops no escape.  EPP Vader comes down to my &lt;&gt;DB and I lose the Raider while he loses Vader and swops with the DB.  I drop Jedi Luke in the cantina.  Dash and Melas float up to the system to protect a new Celebration and another raider goes into the empty craft.  He draws a third 1 for race destiny and I draw high.  I stack decent enough and cancel his first collision with TCFC.  He swaps a Docking bay for it and pulls his other DB.  Drops EPP Vader at the &lt;&gt;DB and Arica into the Cantina.  Vader and another Raider die while he swops another DB for Vader.  He plays Put All Sections to get both DBs back and then plays a DB to get Put All Sections back(for those of you who dont know how it works).  He only really switches his DBs for three things:  Collisions, EPP Vader, and Put All Sections on Alert.  My turn I use tunnel Vision and deploy Ill Take the Leader and drop another Raider in my empty craft.  His turn he is low on force so he tracked a 6 for race destiny but then I Step Backwards him.  He has some forced saved and he feels like wrecking me so here it comes.  Janus comes to my &lt;&gt;DB for 1.  He is gonna battle the Raider/Craft so I cant react and then break my lone Raider with his EPP Vader but Vader slams into a Barrier and Janus dies killing a raider.  At this point he is really low on force and my drains are taking their toll.  I keep on Celebrating and Edging too.  I always make sure I have an extra Edge playable for his MAIH/ROC.  But here is where I play a little risky and go for it.  I put down Protector with my lone Raider and then add in a Raider/Craft.  I figure that he will have to draw destiny and swing or he will lose Vader and a whole lot of force.  My power is 12 and 3 destinies to his 6 and one destiny.  I battle and use his first strike.  He goes for the hack on Chewie and misses and then draws destiny of 6!  Rats, so all he loses is Vader and I lose Chewie and move the new Craft/Raider over the the &lt;&gt;DB where my lone craft is.  I cancel his Collision for the last time and I think he has play it at least 6 times so far.  I keep playing ASB and gaining 1 destiny on him each of his control phases.  His turn, he attempts to kill himself before the Race finishes.  He loses 3 to his own insert and then suicides Arica on my Jedi Luke but her forfeit covers and I get to win the race and retrieve 11 due to his box.  A solid game by both players, his revenge would come soon enough.<br/>
<br/>
FW +22<br/>
Highs:  Lockdown came out.  He drew two of his ships and EPP Vader for his first three draws.<br/>
Lows:  How many times did he deploy EPP Vader?  Minimum of 4.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  My DS Racing vs. Caler Foth(1619) Modified Hayes Pile<br/>
Finally I get a somewhat easy pairing but still not that easy due to the deck hes using.  My turn I stack a 6 on the race and put Emperor at the Arena.  Now my plan was to drop Vader next turn and move them into the hutt because I have had it ruled numerous times in previous tournaments that Empy makes it a battleground.  His turn, he activates 4 and draws it.  He doesnt pull Shmi, Threepio, or Shocking combo&amp;#8230;but he drops Honor dang it!  My turn I get ruled that the Empy doesnt  make it a BG so this sucks big time especially since I find out in ym next control phase when Ive already deploy Vader qand moved him in.  I stack another 6 and drop the Holotable for activation and drop No Escape so he loses to Visage but so do I.  His turn he activates, deploy the Outskirts, and draws it all.  My turn I draw up Mara and Maul and move over Vader and Empy to the Outskirts, win the Race and he loses 9 after the judges rule he cant subtract 2 from the Box and Boonta Eve Podrace.  His turn he gets brave and puts down QuiGon and Shmi to the Outskirts.  My turn I bring down Mara and play Used force lightning to make hitting Qui-Gon easier than it all ready is.  Too bad I cant seem to hit that dang Melas.  I draw a 5 and he loses both and like 10 I think and continues to lose to Visage while the Empy died.  EPP Obi and Twass go to the Arena and Coran goes to the Holotheatre to cancel Visage.  I kill Corran with Maul and Elis Vader and Mara over to Twass and Obi.  Circle isnt in hand but I battle and hack Obi and leave him with Twass while I lose Vader cuz I have another in hand.  He suicides on Mara with Twass bu gets the prediction right.  I redeploy Visage and put another EPP Vader to the outskirts to drain him out.<br/>
FW +31<br/>
Highs:  My decks title proves true.<br/>
Lows:  Not many.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  My DS vs. Arthur Rhodes WYS Balanced<br/>
Man, I have to play Art again.  So I stall him and draw to get an Emperor and Vader.  He terminates Visage and puts Wedge in ship to Kessel.  I put Vader on the Cantina, Empy at the DB, and another Visage comes out.  As for the Podrace he keeps playing A Step Backwards but I cant find a grabber because I had to Twilek for Honor.  I keep playing Collision and so the race is making no progress.  At one point he had 3 ones stacked and I had a 1 stacked also hehe.  He drops Mirax in her ship to Tatooine and flips and plays Terminate out of the Lost pile to cancel my 2nd Visage.  So My turn I drain for 3, and have Fett and Zuckuss in hand but draw into a Focused Attack and Osession and save some and I also redeployed Visage again.  He is forced to draw for tunnels and step backwards so that he can prolong the Race.  I know that he is out of terminates so I bring Zuckuss and Boba down to Tatooine instead of Kessel because Wedge got cannons and he has 3 saved.  I kill Mirax and don&amp;#8217;t have to lose anything.  Melas and Talon Karrde come down to the Cantina and he battles.  Vader somehow hits Melas, but dont ask me how.  After a long rulings question about whether battle destiny is simultaneous(I wanted to beat on Karde the next turn) I decline to draw destiny.  And he realizes that I will drop on Karde next turn so he draws none either.  I have power 8(tatooine) and he has 6 so he loses both characters and Vader stays.  So the rest of the game is mostly a blur.  He played Run Luke Run to cancel my Obsession and I drain for 2 at tatooine, 2 in the cantina,  and 2 at the DB and Arena.  I finally win the race after he plays ASB 6 times&amp;#8230;and the game ends.<br/>
<br/>
FW +16<br/>
Highs:  Controlling Tatooine.<br/>
Lows:  Havent crossed a single jedi all day.  Dang.<br/>
<br/>
Jim and Landon are doing really well and Art has 2 losses and I have one so any of us can make it in.  I get to meet Andy McClure in between games which was cool since I didnt know him yet.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:  My WYS vs. Clint Hays(2147)  SYC Brangus<br/>
We ended up waiting 15 minutes because of a mixed up pairing somewhere.  Well, this is the matchup I wanted and I am feeling confident and not nervous at all.  Ive already played and beat Brians and theyre playing the same thing so I should be alright.  He started Tint/OE and not the box.  Clint stalls me and stacks a fat Hoth: War Room while pulling the Death Star War Room and dropping it.  My starting hand is completely bad, it has no ASB, no Tunnels, and I cant do the first turn flip.  So I drop a Raider/Craft to the DB:94 and pull my H1 DB and draw some.  Clint activates and stacks a 1 on his racer and I stack a 4 and 2 to stay one less than him.  He then drops brangus and draws everything.  Clint plays the Brangus much different than Brian and everyone else.  He literally drew past 20 cards and stacks his hand with exactly what he needs.  My turn I drop Mirax in her ship to the &lt;&gt;DB and and disembark her.  He stacks another 1 on his racer and I stack decently and then he drew and save some force since I cut his activation.  I drop the Falcon, Han, and Melas.  He plays Hit Racer and draws a tracked barrier and then draws high so I use ASB which he grabs so I cant play it from the lost pile.  He drops Emperor and Dr/Ponda Baba to the Cantina and isnerts me with a total of 12 to my 5.  I need to activate it all to Tunnel for Celebration so I do so and lose 7 to the insert and pull Celebration.  He swaps a DB with the Insert  and I ping him for a couple at both DBs and drop Celebration and Bargaining Table.  I drop Jedi Luke to H1:DB and move him over besides the Raider/Craft at DB:94.  His turn he plays Collision which I cancel and he swaps for it and plays PASOA to get back both DBs.  He draws decent and I stack and lose two force.  Arica comes to DB: 94 and Maul goes to &lt;&gt;DB since Ive already commited Melas and Luke.  I drop Dash and a Raider from my Bargaining Table to the Outrider and move it up to the Death Star for the drain.  I move Luke to the Arena so I can get to Maul next turn.  I also Celebrated and spent 1 for it due to Plans.  He gets Janus to my Cantina and draws a bunch.  I blocked his drain with bargaining Table and he drew high and forced me to use another ASB to keep him from winning.  He then starts using Janus to set up Masterful Move and Force Lightning for his perfect Sabaac.  My turn I have him pretty low on force but I am low also.  I drain for 3 at the Death Star), 1 at the system, and celebrated 1 force.  I move Jedi Luke over to the &lt;&gt;DB and let him go.  He activates and plays Sabaac and gets his 6 and 5 and I lose 2 force.  He drains for 3 in the Cantina and I block and then Maul runs away.  The race finishes and I lsoe 6 while he gets 6 back but we both are still very slow.  I had cancelled his Collision twice and he has Swapped for Collision a bunch of times.  I activate and spend 1 to Edge my Luke, he grabs it and I spend 5 to retrieve 5.  Drain for 3 at the Death Star(Control and swapped for it, PASOA for both DBs) and drain for 2 at the the DB and 1 at the system.  I dont want to move Luke to the Arena cuz then he will run Maul and block my drain of 2.  So I pass and let him go.  I save one for the Barrier which is in my lost pile.  He then drops Blast Door Controls, Lateral Damage on the Outrider, First Strike, and Zuckuss at the death star.  He Trooper Sabaaced and I lost 2 since he got it perfect again.  Then he battled to use first strike.  His Battle destiny was a 1 so I lose my Raider.  On my turn, I spend 2 to Celebrate 2, and land the Outrider and disembark Wedge.  His turn he plays perfect Sabaac and I lose 2 and block his drain at the Cantina for the 4th time with my Bargaining Table and lose 1 to his Arena drain.  So this scenario goes on for 2-3 turns.  I drain for 2 at the &lt;&gt;DB, 1 at the system, and Celebrate 2.  Then he drains 1 at the Arena, 3 at the cantina(I ran out of Raiders and started with the Control/TVs), and then plays Pefect Sabaac to make me lose 2.  I have to get no reserve for him to play Sabaac but I spend 2 a turn to use Secret Plans to retrieve the 2 Im losing to Sabaac.  He counter Assaults Dash and draws 2.  He draws a 5 and 1 and I lose 3.  At the end of his turn I have one card in reserve deck now so I cant Celbrate.  I drain for 1, 2, and 1 at the DS:DB and I know I have Control in lost pile for the Cantina drain so I move Jedi Luke in front of Maul forgetting about first strike.  He drains for 3(control), and then battle Jedi Luke and retrieves 1 while I lose one and the game.  Clint played really well and tracked very efficiently, he deserved the win.<br/>
<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;13<br/>
Highs:  Never had to lose 3 from the Cantina drain.  I got the pairing I wanted, I deployed what I wanted, I did exactly what I wanted, and then I lost the game.<br/>
Lows: If I hadnt moved Luke over he only woulda won by 12 which is exactly the amount of the Podrace.  <br/>
<br/>
2 losses does not knock you out of it so I still have a prayer if I can get some help with the pairings.<br/>
<br/>
Game 7:  My LS vs. Jeremy Summeralls(1653) You May Start Your Landing<br/>
<br/>
Ok, this is a great match up for my deck so I feel pretty good about it.  He starts IAO/MP and YMSYLanding.  My starting hand has 2 ASB and a Close for Comfort, could used that last game.    But it also has Dash and a Raider/Craft and Celebration.  So he pulls Executor, Walker Garrison, and then actually deploys the third marker.  Now I don&amp;#8217;t necessary like to stick people to stuff, but at the time I knew it really mattered because I needed to get in the final and he should know his deck well enough to deploy it before he activates.  When I tell him he already deployed he doesn&amp;#8217;t even care, he was completely non-chalant and I was surprised cuz I thought he would at least be upset at himself if not me for holding him to my mistake.  So I get the best first turn Ive ever had with this deck.  I dropped Dash in ship to &lt;&gt;DB for 3, Raider/Craft to DB:94 for 3, Celebration, and then moved Dash up.  Drsome and got Mirax so I wont have to keep staring at these dumb racing interrupts.  His turn he activates and gets Piett with Command, drops Piett and Merrejk to the Coruscant DB and pulls the Fondor system.  I drain 2 total, retrieve my starting interrupt, and drop Mirax in her ship to the &lt;&gt;DB and a Raider outside of the.  I move up Mirax and leave the lone Raider there.  Dash flies over to Fondor so the big ship doesnt come down.  His turn, he drops Mirax to my DB:94 and draws some and saves some.  I start Miraxing and Tunneling to get Luke and his stick into my hand.  So I drop Jedi/Stick to the H1:DB, drop ITTL, Talon Karde in the Cantina, and move Luke  to his Hoth DB and Outrider to Hoth system.  He now decides he is gonna drop the hammer big time and he has 13 force to do it.  I still have my lone Raider at the DB:94 with Arica and a Raider/Craft at the &lt;&gt;DB.  I have no Barrier so here it comes.  Arica breaks cover and 12 force brings down Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader(yikes!).  He battles and I react my craft over and play Portal on Tarkin and he cancels the 5 I draw.  Now I draw a 6, 5, and 2 for destiny and add my power from the system.  Our power breaks even so he loses Mara and Tarkin while I lose a Raider.  Next turn I drain for 3 at the HothDB, 2 at Hoth system, 1 at Tatooine, and 2 in the cantina and Celebrate the Raider I just lost to leave me with no lost pile.  I drop a Raider and Protector and battle Lord Vader but poor draws will let Vaders forfeit cover it while I lose Protector.  I move Luke to the Defensive Perimeter and move a Raider/Craft to ym &lt;&gt;DB.  He drops Executor and Chireanu to Fondor with his 13 force and passes.  I Celebrate my Chewie and drain for 12 and put the Falcon at Tatooine and move the Outrider/Skate over to the Executor. He activates and drops Tarkin on an Imperial Walker at the 3rd Marker and passes.  I activate and On the Edge to kill my Luke, stick, and edge.  I celebrate those three cards back into my life force and then drain him out.  <br/>
FW +36<br/>
Highs:  Differential is high so I might can make it.<br/>
Lows:  Having to hold him to his mistake on turn 1, but as I said earlier the stakes are big and mistakes like that are something he should know not to do if hes played his deck 3 times already(hopefully more).<br/>
<br/>
Landon and Art are out but Jim and I are both 5-2 and have a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8:  My DS vs. Steven Lewis(2118) WYS Balanced<br/>
Do or die, whoever wins this moves on into the final so this is it.  This should be a tough game regardless of what happens.  And he whooped my rear end at DragonCon last year so I wanted some revenge.  He starts Anis Racer, Insight, Insurrection, and Squadron-Word that will be bleeped out &amp;#61514;.  My hand has NO characters, 2 ships, and 1 masterful move.  I play Masterful Move to get the Table, stall him and draw a 5 myself, drop the Table, and draw 3 and find Emperor.  I lose to Visage from hand as does he.  He lost an Edge.  He activates and drops Kessel with Wedge in ship with ITTL, also H1:DB comes from reserve.  I wanted to hit Wedge up but I cant because of ITTL.  So I have No Escape in hand and lose off top of reserve to visage and what flips over?  Vader.  Draw a 6 for the race, drop No Escape to get Vader and drop him in the Cantina to flip, and Holonet on the Table and he takes one to Visage.  I am hitting him with pretty fast and I never saw Honor(for my Table) or Terminate(for Visage) which helped.  So he Tunnels and spends like 5 mintues trying to decide because there is such crap in his force pile.  We joke about it and he drops Mirax in ship to Tatooine after hitting me for three.  He uses Mirax throughout the game by the way.  I play Start Your Engines because I need a 5 to win this darn thing.  There is a 4, 1, and 5!!  Yes! I drain for 3 total, stack the winning 5, win the race which leaves me with no lost pile and him with about 20 minimum lost already.  I draw into both of my Mauls and save a bunch while still doing Visage.   Heres where things get hairy.  He drains for 4 and Tunnels and still cant find much.  The card he does get was threepio who he puts at the H1:DB and uses.  He puts Jedi Luke at the Home One DB and puts the &lt;&gt;DB on the other side of the Arena and moves Luke to it.  We both lose to Visage and I activate some.  I drop Darth Maul into the Cantina to keep the damage even and move Vader outside to the DB:94.  I have Obsession and Focused Attack in hand and will be ready to blind duel next turn.  We both lose to Visage and he drains me for 3 at Kessel, 1 at Tatooine, but forgets to drain for 2 at the &lt;&gt;DB.  He draws a bunch and we both lose to Visage again.  My turn, I have a ton active and I drain for 2 in the cantina, 1 at the Table, and 1 at DB:94. I figure if I can take over Tatooine and drain 2 there then I will easily win the damage race since Im already ahead of him.  So I drop Zuckuss and Fett at tatooine and not Kessel and he doesnt barrier.  I battle her and kill her.  I transit Vader in front of Jedi Luke and he passes on his action.  I then duel and play Focused Attack and draw blind.  He draws two fives giving him a total of 16, I draw and my total is 25 due to me adding 1 to each of my draws and drawing 5, 5, and 6.  So he crosses him and takes 6 and then loses yet another to Visage.  He then drains for 3 and puts Lando at DB:94 and takes on to Visage.  I activate, and drain for 6 total.  He has 5 cards in life force and one in hand.  I move Fett and Zuckuss in front of Wedge and Maul in front of Lando while Vader moves to the Arena.  He takes one to Visage.  Then he activates and draws up.<br/>
<br/>
FW +28<br/>
Highs:  3-turn race, duel, and beating a very good player AND deck builder.<br/>
Lows:  Knocking Steve into 5th place, sorry Steven if you read this.<br/>
<br/>
I finish off at 12 +(129) which is good enough for 2nd place.  Clint takes first going undefeated, congrats.  Rippetoe comes back from starting off 1-2 and pulls in at third.  And because I beat Steven by 28, Jim Boyd squeeks infront of Steven by about 10 differential.  Go Jim!  Jim and his 1752 rating, busts out with an old school Nudge TRM with 5 Revos and a DS deck with 13 Ties and somehow got 4th.  I was thoroughly impressed.  Clint beats Jim in the final and gets the $1000.  I get to choose what side to play against Brian and I chose DS for a couple reasons.  His decks were the same as Clints and Stevens.  I just beat Stevens LS and lost to Clints DS so I wanted to play my DS even though I had beaten him earlier with my LS.  I played Brian and tried hard but it just wasnt to be.  And I missed that dang Melas a total of 3 times in our final game!!  So we switched places and he came in 2nd and me in third.  So I get $50 less, only $150.  Im just glad I made any money at all.  We go to Dennys and Jim buys Landons meal while I buy Arts meal since we both got $150.  Time for Props/slops:<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
All Judges and Coordinators that worked to put this thing together.  Some names that come to mind are Adam Drake, Jim Colson, and Kevin D.<br/>
ALL eight opponents for giving me some tough but enjoyable games.<br/>
Landon for driving all the way up and down(and testing).<br/>
Jim for somehow coming in fourth!<br/>
Art for testing, too bad I never drew 7-3-3 for the race.  Seve, Shree, Shree!<br/>
David Akers and Neal Razi for coming all the way up to this event.  They didn&amp;#8217;t even play in it either.  They skipped the Florida Open also.  And those awesome shirts they gave out to 5-8th place, and that gatorade in between games!<br/>
Andy for winning the Warm-Up tourney.<br/>
David Irvine for winning the Florida Open(Im pretty sure of this).<br/>
Decktech, they made like $75 off the event, if even that?  That was pretty unselfish.<br/>
The waffle.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
None whatsoever!<br/>
<br/>
I had fun all 9 games and would do it again if I could.  I got to play against some of the best in the world and you cant ask for much more than that.  Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it. </font></td>
