<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well it all happened a month ago when I heard the news I’ve been waiting to hear........."Video Connection closing, Milford will take over the tournaments"  SWEET!  For all of you who don’t know, Video Connection was a tiny movie rental place with a few tables so it doubled up as a card store.  Everyone used to go to these crappy tournaments too, so we’d cram 25 smelly star wars player at like tables that fit 10.  They decided to add more tables to a small area, which did not solve this cramming problem, and conversely made it more cramped.  Then genius idea they had, we got extra tables (cuz people stopped going to the Star Wars tournaments cuz they sucked) so we’ll have magic tournaments the same day.  Oh god no, if Star Wars players reeked Magic players were worse.  This and the fact the prize support was Cloud City packs was enough for me to not waste my time with these tournaments much.  Well neways, end of that rant, my friend Jared Greenwald decided to pick up the monthly trend at a store called TJ’s in Milford which is a sweet place for tournaments, plenty of room, fresh air.  Ahhhh.  Seriously all you old Video Connection players should go play there, the tournaments are sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Well as far as my decks went, I was playing my version of Steven Lewis’ Palace Raiders and I decided I’d trade some promo foils get up to 5 Emperors and try Dark Surgeon out with some SAC in the spirit of what Kyle Craft used at the DPC.  <br/>
<br/>
So i’m talking to my friend Hayes Hunter, who happens to be number 3 in the world (cheap pop), and he tells me that he is gonna go to the tournament just to sell some cards to make money for Tatooine but he’s not gonna play.  Hayes has talked about cutting down the amount of SWCCG tournaments he plays in and increasing the Legend Of The Five Rings tournaments, so I thought nothing of it and told him my decks and had him help me make a few changes to them so they could be more effective.  Cool<br/>
<br/>
Well the day before the tournament the kid I was swapping rides with, Rich Hinds, ended up telling me that he wasn’t gonna be able to go.  Oh how @#$%ing wonderful.  Now I was out of a ride and I had to find a way to the tournament.  Well it looked like I was losing hope so I just asked Rich won more time online if he could hook me up with a ride.  After telling him i’d pay for his gas and build his decks apparently his dad could give us a ride and he didn’t need decks anymore.  Strange how that all spun around in a circle to what we originally agreed on. :-/<br/>
<br/>
Well anyways I was psyched that I got to go to the tournament, we got a little lost from mapquest, but we got there ok.  We had 17 participants then Hayes decided he’d play.  Well that was cool no byes and a really good player too.<br/>

Pretournament Rating: 1581 (with 3-1 not in)<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:<br/>
WYS Palace Raiders vs. Paul Maholick’s (1645) Hunt Down 7’s<br/>
<br/>
Well Paul is a really cool guy who I have played in a few games before and the results are pretty much split, with him winning a few more than me.  I knew he was playing the 7’s version before the game even started because he was going around asking to trade for Visages etc.  Well before we started he tells me he decided he’d play two fun decks just for the hell of it which is pretty cool of him to do that and not be as competitive about the game as everyone else.  Well his first turn he pulls Carida and the Executor: Docking Bay.  He drew his force pile, most likely realizing he had a Vader in there when he saw his deck.  We each lose one to Visage.  My turn I activate, pull spaceport docking bay, pull falcon drop it move it up to system, draw the rest and trans term visage.  He goes activates, pulls cloud city docking bay, drops vader, flips, drops visage and drops prince xizor with vader.  I lost one to visage, i think it was a control/tunnel vision off the top.  I activated, drained for one at the system, he lost a circle from hand.  I looked at the epp luke in my hand, realized i had a lightsaber, he didn’t and my destinies are pretty good.  I dropped epp luke to the cantina hoping he would blind duel.  He did.  I drew a 4 and a 3, him a 3 and a 2.  I win.  Cool, vader went out of play and he lost 9.  I then deployed a palace raider and a dash rendar to the site, flipping my objective.  I battle Xizor, hit him, make him forfeit zero.  Draw 2 battle destiny, he ended up losing like another 10 to the battle.  So now he has like about 20 cards or so in his hand.  We each lost one to visage.  He activated his turn and just drew.  We each lost one to visage.  I activate, deploy a palace raider on a patrol craft.  I play Tatooine Celebration.  Basically that was game, I drained him repeatedly and retrieved and he eventually drew up.  <br/>
FW +29<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning a blind duel<br/>
Lows: Having the blind duel cost my friend so much.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
AOBS vs. Ryan Driscoll&amp;#8217;s (1429) QMC<br/>
<br/>
I had met Ryan a week or so prior to this tournament and he seemed like a pretty cool kid.  So I went into this game wanting to have fun in the game but also to make sure I win it.  Well my first turn I pulled Kuat and dropped a Presence Of The Force on the Coruscant Docking Bay, threw and Emperor there, moved Xizor there pulled monnok and force lightning and flipped.  I let him go, his turn he pulls Bespin Cloud City and decided to deploy Luke on Red 5 there.  SWEET.  So he lets me go, takes one direct damage, and a drain of one.  I pull the Death Star Docking Bay, deploy a Vigo to Xizor&amp;#8217;s site, played battle order pull force lightning and I have you now.  I transit palpy over and put a force lightning in my used pile to see the rest of my force pile.  Well I see an iggy w/gun a jodo kast a vigo and my broken concentration there so I draw them all and let him go.  He activated like 6 decided not to drain pulled a cc site and deployed wedge for red squadron 1 to bespin and let me go.  I gave him 2 direct damage and drained for 2.  I pulled force lightning again and put it back seeing my force pile.  Top card was bossk in hounds tooth, rest was crap I just left it letting him go.  He activated, drained me for one, and pulled another site.  He dropped Crix Madine to one and Melas to another flipping his objective.  Oh yeah, I forgot about his objective, guess I should do something.  He moved Crix over to melas&amp;#8217; site and said go.  He left one force for a barrier.  I activated drained him for 2 and gave him 2 direct damage.  I deployed broken concentration and took that one force away.  I deployed iggy, a vigo, jodo kast and 4lom to the site with melas and crix.  I got to use my cool objective to look at the top 3 cards of my deck. 4 5 1 that order.  Cool.  I battle, capture melas with a tracked 4 :-P.  I then made sure I canceled Crix Madine&amp;#8217;s broken game text.  I won that battle he lost like 9 and crix, I lost nothing.  He went again, drained me for 2.  He drew some and said go.  Well I drained him for 2 I think and he lost 2 direct damage.  I deployed Bossk in Hounds Tooth to bespin and threw a Vigo on there.  I checked out my destiny, cool it&amp;#8217;s a 6 (Palpy).  I deploy first strike, battle, retrieve one make him lose one yadda yadda I kill off wedge, he kills my Vigo.  I got to put my hand back with broken concentration preventing him from drawing up.<br/>

Lows: I&amp;#8217;m gonna have to play&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
My WYS vs. Hayes Hunter&amp;#8217;s (2198) MKOS<br/>
<br/>
Fantastic.  Ok yeah he kicked my ass.  If being number 3 in the world wasn&amp;#8217;t enough, he also new my whole deck. YAY!!!!!!!!!!  Well basically his first turn he drops jabba.  He tells me later when he used power of the hutt to look for stuff in his deck he realized all of his space was in his force pile.  He drew it all up.  My first turn, completely oblivious, I deployed captain han on a falcon to space thinking that I could back it up next turn.  Well it didn&amp;#8217;t make it to the next turn.  His turn he activates.  Deploys Scum, Bib Fortuna an abyssin then here comes guri, stinger, virago and xizor to the Tatooine system.  F_U_C_K.  He battles draws a 5 and a 6 which becomes 15 battle destiny with his objective flipped.  He cancels my draw with a Myo.  Wonderful.  I lost the falcon and everyone and like 9 force.  More importantly, I just lost the system for the rest of the game.  It was all pretty much done then, he drained the hell out of me and retrieved everything.  Too bad he played so many cards to kick my @#$% so bad cuz it kept his differential lower than it should have been.<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;26  Total: 4+34<br/>
Highs: Hayes playing so many cards.<br/>
Lows: Hayes kicking my @#$% with so many cards.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My AOBS vs. Hayes Hunter&amp;#8217;s (2198) Hidden Mains<br/>
<br/>
Now I&amp;#8217;m not so happy Hayes kept his differential down J  I could have played this game a lot better, and my hand sure as hell didn&amp;#8217;t help.  I sensed the wrong interrupts, didn&amp;#8217;t wait until having hidden weapons to battle and had no response to his 2nd turn jedi luke.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t kill it, that really blowed.  He outdrained me and retrieved and I lost again.<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;26 Total: 4+8<br/>
<br/>
Highs: The fact that if someone beat me that bad twice in a row I&amp;#8217;m glad it was Hayes.<br/>
Lows: Everything else.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
My AOBS vs. Aaron Ross&amp;#8217; (1462) There Is Good In Him<br/>
<br/>
Originally I thought this objective would be one of the problems for my deck.  I dropped Palpy to his endor docking bay early and began choking him of force.  He moved Luke over and we both flipped our objectives and were forcing each other to lose 2 force a turn.  He deployed crix madine and a scout to his home one docking bay for activation.  I saw this and then looked at the presence of the force hidden weapons, fett w/gun and vigo in my hand and said &amp;#8220;cool&amp;#8221;.  I activated deployed everything there, checked out my top 3 destinies (2, 4, 4) cool.  I deployed a vigo to palpys site too and played search destroy.  I battled, captured crix and beat the pulp out of the scout.  He lost like 9 I lost nothing.  He took one to search destroy.  He activated and deployed obi and a scout to the home one docking bay.  Lucky me had another hidden weapons in hand.  I played it, got a 3 for destiny. SWEET.  Obi, Luke and Crix are all capture now.  I hit the scout and made him lose like 7 this time.  Search destroy, drains, and black sun damage finished him off.<br/>
<br/>
FW +22   Total:  6+30<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Starting my comeback<br/>
Lows: Nothing<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
My WYS vs. Johnny Rivera&amp;#8217;s (1558) Johnny Vegas Style Cowboys From Hell ISB<br/>
<br/>
For game 6 I got to play JOHNNYYYYYYY Vegas.  Cool, way to end a tournament on a fun note.  Well this deck is the F-U-C-K-I-N-G Bomb and Johnny played it really well.  He flipped his objective, and set up Imperial Decree completely killing my drains.  He sent in stormtroopers to Tatooine completely killing harvest.  All I could do was celebrate my lost on tatooine.  I tried keeping the differential low and I killed all my characters at the end to end it with a fun note.<br/>
<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;24  FINAL: 6 +6<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Losing to JOHNNYYYYYYYYY Vegas<br/>
Lows: Getting locked down<br/>
<br/>
