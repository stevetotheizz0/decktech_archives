<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay here is the Mirkwood tuesday night report.<br/>
<br/>
Okay I didn’t write one last week since I went 1-3 and really haven’t been enjoying playing as much for a few months, but this week I decided that I would build my own Court deck (court of the vile Imperials, won’t be posted thought unless people want it), and I went with the same TIGIHelomsmuggler odds that I had brought last week (not a great deck, since I am not really good at playing odds, I prefer beatdowns, but a nice change from mains). anyway on to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my LS vs. Chad Steger and his BHBM (where is the TR Wormanator???)<br/>
<br/>
Okay this is a match up that I should win, since he takes Luke, and gets moved to the Throne room, and I play Elom beats plus odd.  and it all went according to plan.  I got 3 eloms out and inserted, it came up, he lost 8 force, he put out Xixor and Guri, and took over the only Battleground site, and put out the odds canceller.  Okay, I put out Kashyyk, and Dash in his ship, plus Mirax in her ship.  He deployed the Exec, but couldn’t battle, I battle,. he loses like 8 force, to this point I only have 1 card stacked and he has 2.  Next Turn he deploys thrawn, and wipes me out of space.  I put out the Backdoor, and now I was activating more than 6 force a turn (a problem all game) but now he has 3 cards stacked and is attempting to turn Luke he loses the duel, and stacks one, but then draws a 4, Luke is turned, game over I lose by 3 with at least 30 cards left.  oh well, thems the breaks, all in all a fun game since Chad is a great opponent (he plays foir the fun of it, and we always have fun).<br/>
<br/>
game 2 my DS vs. Rob Jeffries TIGIH.<br/>
<br/>
Okay my opening hand is Vader Tarkin, so I know this game will go well, To fulfill court I deploy Tarking to the Tat. DB, then I move him to Endor, Rob gets 2 force his first turn, he moves luke over, and Tarkin take control,.  My turn Vader comes down to the Tat. DB, and Tarkin moves to join his friend.  They stayed there for the entire game later to be joined by the Emporer, who adds 2 to attrition everywhere, and helped me a ton this game.  I really don’t know what Rob was trying to accomplish, but he really never came to battle me (except for once) and seemed content to lost this game just cause he was playing me (I know I’m intimidating, but not that much so)  Nothing really special happened, I set up on Tatooine with 2 sites and the system, plus Tat. Occ. and really just out drained him, I went to stop his drains on CC with Mighty Jaba and Beolo, and that was game.  FW by 7<br/>
<br/>
Okay this game report was kind of short since the game was really uneventful.  Rob seems to have a mental block against playing the better players in the area, and this game was no exception, he has no self confidence, and seems willing to lose, he should have beaten me, since Elom swarm can do Imperials a lot of damage, but wasn’t willing to take that step.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs. MoffWicket (oaky as I’ve said before, I hate playing Justin in tournaments since we play enough for fun at my house)<br/>
<br/>
He had EBO, vs. my court.<br/>
<br/>
Okay there was only 1 battle in this game and he wiped me out in space, on that one, so i confined myself to the ground and tried to use my direct dmage to kill him while he drained for a ton in the air.  The only cool thing was when I deployed Igar he noble Sacced Crix (who he had ued to pull scouts to set up EBO) and retrieved 6 force.  Otherwise this was a drain race, which Justin won by 4.<br/>
<br/>
Again sorry for the lack of detail, but this game wasn’t that interesting, the only reason it was a close as it was is because I knew that I had to cause as much dmage as posible, and I kept Epant mon at one edge of Tat.  Preventing his spies (most of his ground force) from moving in and assaulting me.<br/>
<br/>
Okay last game vs. Travis Bean and his BHBM.<br/>
<br/>
Okay Travis is another good player, and one of the few around here who has been playing as long as me (Mike and Jerome an Chad I know you have been too).  So I knew that this would be a good game, and it lived up to my expectations, Travis was too scared of an Elom beatdown to spread out, so he was doing very little damage to me, I hit him once for an insert for 8 force, and then couldn’t ind another one for at lest 4 turns, but he was only draining me for 2 or 3 force, and was afraid to duel, since my destinys were good enough that I won a couple and made him stack cards.  He never challenged me in space where Dash, Wedge (ANH) and theiur good friend the Elom were draining and giving me an odds total of 11.  Poor Sim Aloo did get squished by Corran Horn (a destiny 3 ability 4 character who is power 5 against spies or BH’s GREAT CARD) and 2 Elom associates, then I got another Insert into his deck (after IG w/gun and 4-Lom with stick put a hurt on an Elom (after capturing Corran) thank god for Japanese Houjux (cancells all remaing BD and lets you blow one rasberry at your opponent just for having the gall to attack you, it really says it read the  card, I took 3 years of German in college, I can read any foriegn language there is, I just take a few creative libertys:).  And after I got another insert into his deck, and he had to pay 3 to drain (I love Battle Plan) Travis just kept saying how mean I was.  I aggreed, and the game ended when he dueled Luke, and drew his 2 destiny, lost stacked a card shuffled, drew for the Trun destiny (could’t get it anyway but I made him draw the card:) and ther was my insert for 8 more force, which is all he had left.  Game FW by about 10.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay this tourney was a blast, I didnt’ do real well, but I had a lot of fun, and I’m starting to remember why I play the game in the first place.<br/>
