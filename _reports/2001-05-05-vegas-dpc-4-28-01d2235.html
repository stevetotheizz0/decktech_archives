<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I finally get this TR typed up a week after the tourny. Sorry bout that.<br/>
<br/>
Well it all starts on thursday night.  After a week full of parties and some otherstuff I<br/>
finallly get some time to build some decks for the dpc.  For dark I decide to stick with my<br/>
BHBM since it has won me the last three tourneys I played in down here in San Diego.  It<br/>
has got higher destiny than any other deck out there(I mean it).  And For light I go with a<br/>
Profit with Boshuda, Order to engage , Baragwins, intrudermissles, and on the edge.  I am<br/>
quite suprised I have never seen any thing like the light i am playing ever before, It is slow<br/>
but it just wont die.  To many people will be to prep’d for WYS, and HB mains cant<br/>
compete as well as it use to. I end up staying up til one cuz I felt like bleaching my hair to<br/>
give it that orange tint.  Me and Geoff finally leave for Vegas after school on friday. Vegas<br/>
is a six hour drive from here, get there, get a hotel, go to sleep and leave for the tourny the<br/>
next morning.  The tourny is a @#$% to find. It is in some round building, on a college<br/>
campus, with Mac in its name.  It wasnt my job to get the directions or else i woulda... <br/>
We find it after about 25 minutes of looking round on the campus.  We show up and fill<br/>
out the decklists and pay the entry fee.   The four better players (in my Opinion) from San<br/>
Diego make it so we are well represented.<br/>
I am rated 1824 with 31 games going into the DPC. Skill, but not much expierience.<br/>
<br/>
Game one<br/>
<br/>
My LS vs Chris Hines’s Agents of the Black Sun<br/>
<br/>
Chris is a nice guy and rated 1950 or so from what he said.  I start only Uh Oh and<br/>
insurrection since he starts Sac Protection.  He starts fett and snoova to the chamber.  He<br/>
pulls generic docking docking bay and moves xizor over to it for the flip... I completely<br/>
forgot blacksun could flip first turn and didnt start oonee taaa Dammit. He then proceeds<br/>
to move Snoova and fett  to JP.  Well things arent looking good.  I am flippin through my<br/>
hand I have epp luke, epp obbi, epp leia, boshuda, no wait thats oonee taa(to god damn<br/>
many pictures of Jabba’s face on cards nowdays). Hell yeah.  So I drop the whole crew on<br/>
xizor.  He draws 2 for destiny, I draw an Intruder missile and add one with HFTMF.  He<br/>
loses xizor and fourteen.  He played a much better game after that than I would have<br/>
expected him to. Later  He captured luke once with jodo cast but obbi got him back after<br/>
removing jodo’s head easily.  He attacks with Xizor and guri, luke narrow escapes, Ig-88<br/>
attacks, luke dodges,  Bobba fett shows up and luke On the edges and leaps off the Cloud<br/>
landing platform yelling "you’ll never take me alive." Miracuously he shows up a minute<br/>
later back at Jabbas palace.  Harcseff and baragwins save me from all his drains of 1.<br/>
FW By 31<br/>
2(31)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Luke doin what it takes.<br/>
Lows: Beat Downs are cheap.<br/>
<br/>
Well after this game Geoff tells me that he forgot prep’d defenses in his ISB and he cant<br/>
put it in now.  Oh darn.  Later he still wins three games with it, starting only arrest order.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
<br/>
My DS vs Brandon Chang’s Real HB<br/>
<br/>
This is the one game I get to play at the first table.  Well I start first strike instead of op<br/>
enforce cuz flip HB usually plays cheap stuff. I start with vader, janus, sim and 2 zuckuss<br/>
in my starting hand. Zuckuss wins me a battle 2nd turn against wedge, then cannons get<br/>
him.  I drop vader. He drops theron to endor with wedge and luke to vaders.  I drop 3<br/>
dreads and Xizor to wedges site I attack he power pivots, outa nowheres, cancels my five<br/>
and  all I have is eleven power.  He draws twelve for attrition. I forget that I can trash the<br/>
dread that Xizor is on without counting Xizors forfeit.... I leave one dread, I have no force<br/>
saved, Beatdown for 25 next turn. basically game over.<br/>
FL -22<br/>
2(+9)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  At least vader kicked lukes @#$% in the throne room...<br/>
Lows: I could Have prevented the beat down 3 ways:<br/>
Not using sims Game text and moving the dread away with the one more force i would<br/>
have had. <br/>
Shuttling Sim and Janus abourd for free to reduce the battle damage.<br/>
I played like a scrub.<br/>
This is the first game I’ve lost in 3 months..<br/>
The Ugly:  He told me he was rated 1500.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
<br/>
LS vs. Jared Aurther’s Set your course Ties<br/>
<br/>
I thought  I would win this game and well I got corran horn in my starting hand and I<br/>
forgot the whole game that he could break a spies cover or else he would have take about<br/>
15 more in drains cuz he got U-3PO out 3rd turn and he started mara in the chamber. I<br/>
drew to much looking for on the edges and got monnoked twice for 4 cards each time and<br/>
only got on the edge once. He set for stunned Han twice And it was not going good. I<br/>
finally realize I am gonna lose right at the end.<br/>
FL(by 4)<br/>
2(+5)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Sitting next to Brian Hunter, hey everyone loses, cept I lost again.<br/>
Lows: Playin like a scrub again..<br/>
<br/>
Well I knew that the odds are 2 or 3 people in the top four  will go 6 and 2 so I still had a<br/>
pretty good chance if I won the next 5 games.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
<br/>
My DS vs John Patchel’s TIGIH<br/>
<br/>
Well prior to today This was the last person I had lost to... He was playing TIGIH w/<br/>
oonee taa vs My Rops...  Anywayz  I decide to not nab luke right away with the emperor<br/>
cuz I am usually really unlucky when tryin to get vader into my hand... So luke moves to<br/>
the DB and Xizor and 4 lom come down to attack I draw four, he draws a five,  Everyone<br/>
dies and it is a tie.. He drops Jedi luke to the JP AC with a palace raider and yoxgit (why<br/>
do you play the audiece chamber? Choke vader goes to the endor DB and he cant activate<br/>
or drain at lukes location... He forgot about that.  Then Obi kills Vader and some how<br/>
wins the battle.  Vader with saber than hits the chamber w/ his good frieds Dre and Ponda,<br/>
and he loses alot of force.  Rise my friend gets vader back to the DS throne room and IG<br/>
goes down to support Ponda.  He wins 2 battles on tatooine cuz he sensed everything I<br/>
played But xizor at the back door and duels won me the game... He had 4 cards stacked<br/>
cuz I lost a duel and he was tracking to win another but I tracked my Visage of the<br/>
eperoror and masta move so i never lost. Still over all I played horribly.<br/>
<br/>
FW +8<br/>
4(+13)<br/>
Highs:  High destiny kills<br/>
Lows: Who plays senses now days any ways?<br/>
<br/>
Jim, the highest ranked player in SD, just droped after losing 3 games.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
<br/>
My DS vs Michael Memloza’s EBO(not sure i got the last name right)<br/>
<br/>
BHBM got its act together in this game. I start first strike instead of OP enforce.  I get<br/>
vader to endor db he gets commie luke to the 4th marker.  Eventually w/janus constantly<br/>
going and 25 cards in my force pile he decides it is no longer safe for luke at the fourth<br/>
marker and moves him under the shiel and loses to your destiny...  Luke and bout 30 force<br/>
would have been lost if he would not have moved luke, cuz he was right I had the hole<br/>
crew in my hand.  He sets up EBO and gets an x-wing to kiffex. 3 dreads come down on<br/>
it, he barriers 2 of them, mara hits the last dread and I draw a 6 and 7 for destiny, he loses<br/>
a bunch, including a houjix from his hand but he used all his force on the barriers.  He gets<br/>
luke to vader finally and moves a snowspeeder w/ hobbie and zev to the fourth marker. <br/>
Xizor, Dre, Blizzard 2, and tempest 3 get rid of the speeder but his forfeit covers it.<br/>
Everyone then moves over to the DB where there is an X-wing trapped because he lost<br/>
the hoth system to your destiny.  Game over next turn.<br/>
FW+34<br/>
6(+47)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
<br/>
My LS vs Brett Kitani’s Hunt down<br/>
<br/>
He droped vader to the 2/2 cc location and drained their for the rest of the game. Ben Hit<br/>
Jabbas palace 2nd turn then 4 lom, janus and sim came down to fight. Ben killed janus and<br/>
died... Then Obi w/ saber, leia w/gun, Harc,and chewie protector came down and he lost<br/>
every thing + 15 or so damage. Next turn he saves ten,  I free han and beggar his ten away<br/>
for secret plans... Thats so cool. maken them pay for your retrieval...  I drain, he drains, I drain for more, he<br/>
loses.<br/>
<br/>
FW+22<br/>
8(+69)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  The Beatdowns keep commin. all of the games i played in this tourny except one<br/>
had a beatdown. And my profit doesnt even activate more than 9 force each turn...<br/>
Lows:I  Never fallen portal this whole tourny and i only pull off 1 on the edge.<br/>
<br/>
Game7<br/>
<br/>
This is where It is all at.<br/>
<br/>
My LS vs Clayton Atkin’s "Atkin’s Skrillings"<br/>
<br/>
No secret plans this game. First three turn no characters hit the table. He monnoks me<br/>
twice for some cards then I retrieve every thing he monnoked me for when i free han with<br/>
a baragwin.  He drops Pote and 2 skrillings to the chamber and inserts.  I play lando W/ax <br/>
to JP and order to engage .  He attacks lando with vader and 4 skrillings lando dodges. <br/>
He saw the dodge in my hand when he monnoked me twice and he still attacks???  He<br/>
retrieves this battle and the rest of the game with scum while he has an imperial on the<br/>
table and i forgot all about that no imperial stuff and i never could remember to cancel<br/>
scum when I had the chance....  vader drops his odds quiete a bit. He gets pote and friends<br/>
out of the chamber.  I drain on cloud city with eppl luke and leia... while odds come up on<br/>
me 4, count it 4 times, for 5 or 6 each.  he sets up battle order with bosk.  Finally he<br/>
attacks leia with 3 scrilling + dre, retrieves with scum.  I outa somewhere for obi, run luke<br/>
run, clash dre and the skrillings bite the dust + alot more. I drew the RLR and the outa<br/>
somewhere in my starting hand, he saw them twice with monnoke and he still attacked.<br/>
My turn I sit and wait and dre attacks leia and obi and luke and stunning leaders them<br/>
retrieves with scum then runs away i finally use the 4 to cancel scum.  I then drain for<br/>
some and spread back to the chamber with luke.  He drops cantina and moves all the<br/>
skrillings round so vader and dre are in the cantina and 2 sckillings are at the db 94 and<br/>
pote at 3 where at JP.  I Drain for my 3 and make him lose 2 from profit.  He drains for<br/>
some and reduces my deck to 6, time is called. I drain for 3 and 2 profit he is down to 5.  I<br/>
time win. 6-5<br/>
TW+6<br/>
9(+75)<br/>
Highs: I dont feel that bad, I messed up, i deserve a timed win. <br/>
Lows: Messing up. He retrieved 6 with scum while an imperial was on the table and never<br/>
drew a destiny for anything the whole game the whole game. Last 6 cards 2 where on the<br/>
edge and 1 was an intruder missile, i never got em...  <br/>
If I wasnt panicking cuz i wanted a full win, at the end when they called 2 minute I<br/>
probably coulda realized that if I move lando over to JP and Leia and obi  to DB 94 he<br/>
woulda lost on my next turn....<br/>
I scrub out again... A timed win wont get me any where. <br/>
The Ugly:  Clayton got like 2 timed wins and a timed loss, dude that sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Well last game is a missmatch I believe, I was playing at the second table and I won, And<br/>
now I am at  the third table... what happened?  I am 9 and + 75 and I am playin against<br/>
some one 8 and +30...  What is this?  There are 3 people closer in score to me on the<br/>
opposite side of the force..<br/>
<br/>
My LS vs Danny Rider<br/>
<br/>
Fake EBO kinda.  He start insurection, strike planing, staging areas and 1st and 4th<br/>
marker.  Apparently he has done ok with it though.  He pulls all the D bays and gives me<br/>
luke vader and luke start to duel while no escape and mara and friends tear  up twass and<br/>
melas at the generic D bay.  Then he double agents mara with blount on his turn.   Then<br/>
my other mara jade comes down with xizor and Nevar yalnals blount and attacks Premiere<br/>
obi and cracken... people die and so on. First strike Is geting me tons of froce back while<br/>
Janus is getting me the cards I need  and setting up destiny.  I win every duel cept 1. <br/>
Game ends considerably fast. Mains cant handle BHBM.<br/>
Fw(+23)<br/>
11(+98)<br/>
Somewhere they subtracted ten from my score and I signed it so i guess my real ranking is<br/>
11(+88).<br/>
<br/>
Well It’s over now.  I get called up after 9 people and get my Holo Decree  foil..  So I<br/>
guess I made tenth.  Not to bad, I’ll do better  next time.  When I get back home and log<br/>
on to the net and see the rankings I realize how close I really was to making it to the top<br/>
four..  As brian hunter only made it to 12(+95).  Every one else from San Diego dropped<br/>
after losing a few games  I believe, except  for geoff who went 4 and 4.  <br/>
