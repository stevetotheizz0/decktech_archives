<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"> This was my absolute first (yes, first) tournament (other than 1 sealed deck a year ago). The reasons for this are many, but it is mainly due to the lack of a tournament scene near where I live (this tournament was an hour's drive away). Anyway, enough of my ranting, on to the good stuff...<br/>
<br/>
PreTournament:<br/>
<br/>
Since I have no one to playtest with, I'm left with the Internet as my only option. I scrub all my decks, and sit down to start all over. I test them out via AOL IM, and I'm almost set. Turns out I don't have to drive myself to the tournament, my father needs to run some errands nearby, so I get to hitch a ride. I arrive and start talking with the players there, do a few small trades, and the action begins...<br/>
<br/>
The Tournamnet:<br/>
<br/>
Pairings are announced, and it looks like I'm LS (decks will be posted below).<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My Stike team vs. His Space Thing<br/>
<br/>
Game starts, he deploys Kessel (and that was all) and I drop RST stuff, Frigate for Strike Planning, Menace Fades, and Squadron Assignments. He's activation 4 to my 5, pretty close. His turn, he activates and passes, my turn. I drop Madine from hand to RLS for 2, go searching for a general. Grab Gen. Solo, grab CoK w/ Madine, grab Wuta w/ Chewie. I start hauling out sites and scouts, spread to drain, he just drains at Kessel for 1 per turn. He decides to go for Endor too, but the drains on the ground are killing him. I win the drain race, feeling pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Side note: 10 minutes into the game, I hear one of the pair next to me say: "I play Vader's Obsession to initate an Epic Duel". I just laughed, then I play him next game. Ouch.<br/>
FW: 2(+??)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My RallOps vs. ???'s Asteroid Sanctuary<br/>
<br/>
First of all, let me mention my stupidity. I was constructing all week, and even thought to bring a Come Here You Big Coward, but failed to put it in my deck before the tourny starts. Ouch. Starts out like I'm winning, I get set up on Ralltiir by 3rd turn, and I'm feeling pretty confident in my DS deck. He's got some hoth sites on the table, with a little Princess/Reflection action going, and I'm happily draining away. Then he Starts dropping the asteroid sites. Big One, then two Asteroid fields, then two Santuaries. So I'm choking down on 1 force drain, 6 sanctuary a turn, while I'm only draining for 5. With me already being set up, having about 20 cards on table, I didn't last long.<br/>
<br/>
FL: 2(??)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS vs. His SFS<br/>
<br/>
He starts out, and I know I am in trouble. The space force I've got in my deck consists of Nien/Gen. Cal/Gold Squadron 1, Wedge RSL/RS 1, and Tala 1/2 with pilots. He's getting mondo activation, popping out sullust, Kiffex, swapping my Endor, and PoFing nearly every drain system. He's winning, he knows it, so he decides to have some fun. He drops down to Endor, offloads 2 pilots, and battles. I play Insertion Planning, he loses a few and pilots. That was the highlight of the game. Next game is more fun.<br/>
<br/>
FL: 2(??)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS vs. His MWYHL<br/>
<br/>
I start the usual (Combat Response, IAO, and Mobilization points) and he drops his traing stuff w/ no starting interrupt. I get set up by third turn, and he attempts first test on turn 2... failed. I give him some advice, he catches on, and we continue. Turn 3, his test fails again. Turn 4, he passes (yay) and he does ok on all the others until test 4. He gets stuck there, as his reserve deck consists of all 2's, so I'm just draining the life out of him. This is where it gets fun. I have Lord Vader and Vader's Saber sitting on Ralltiir. I move them into space, over to Kashyyyk, over to Dagobah, and down to Luke's little testing area. I battle, he loses a couple. Next turn, I battle again, slash up luke, and he loses luke and a couple. Final turn, I slash Yoda (you'd better believe it) and he loses about 12. Game over.<br/>
<br/>
FW: 4(??)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS vs. His RallOps<br/>
<br/>
I knew this is where the challenge would be, but it didn't help that I recognized the threat, I had to overcome it. Oh well, you can't win them all. He gets set up on Ralltiir by turn 5, and I make the mistake of leaving Madine at HO: WR by himself. Out comes PoF, Lord Vader, and Saber friend. Battle, die, he force drains there the rest of the game for 3. I lose the drain race, and he verifies my deck at least 3 times (cruel and unusual). <br/>
<br/>
FL: 4(-6) Ha! I found out my differential!<br/>
<br/>
Final Game: DS vs. His Rebel Strike Team<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised to see another person playing this, but as it turned out, it was kind of interesting. I get set up, drain for 3 or 4 turns, and then he blows the bunker (I'm not too worried about it). I drop Igar/Tempest 1, Veers/Blizzard 2 to landing site, Lord Vader w/ Old Saber and Tarkin to Backdoor. He blows bunker, and about 20 guys come over to my site. He initiates, wacks Tarkin with obi+saber, I cancel his bd, and end up losing about 5. Next turn, I move the walkers over and leave them setting there. Next turn, he initates, hits Vader, I hit Obi, I win pretty badly (I played Imperial Command and added one). He loses whole crew. I'm still draining, so he plops DOS w/ saber and Gen. Han down on Ralltiir (or rather, ships them out via Nabrun). Battles, loses Han and a couple due to my react, then tries to hunt guys down w/ daughter. I win the drain race, game over, tourny over =(<br/>

FW: 6(+3)<br/>
