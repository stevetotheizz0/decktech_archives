Going into this tournament I've taken like 3 tourneys in a row, then I got third at states, then a few even before that.  I am very confident and I want 5 points to get my rating up over 1900.  So anyways...<br/>

Light : Throne Room, nothing special<br/>
Dark : Ralltiir Ops, nothing special<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs. Zack Simmons (1243)<br/>
He starts CCT, I give him Wedge.  First turn I drop 2 twix and a Nudj from hand, then get a Nudj from deck.  Pretty solid start.  I draw the rest and get an Obi-Wan and Gift of the Mentor, and I have an EPP Luke in my hand.  Sweet.  On his turn he deploys Tat: JP, Tatooine : Docking Bay, Audience Chamber and like the Dungeon.  My turn I pop out EPP Luke, Obi w/stick and Oola to his Audience Chamber so I'm draining for 3.  He puts Boba Fett over on CC, so I drain, use Oola then Nabrun over and beat him for like 16 cards.  Your turn.  He deploys some dudes to Tatooine, Boussh blocks that drain.  He pops out the Death Star Assault Squadron at his Tatooine for a drain.  Oola makes sure he can't beat me down anywhere and I spread on CC.  This game is a blur but I just drain and beat him down for the win.<br/>

HIGHS : Winning<br/>
LOWS : I hate beating little kids... also the little kid who made the loss even harder on him by saying "Man by saying you're way dead, I'm saying it nicely" and so forth... but to make his day a little happier I gave Zack the WB Anakin's saber that he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs. Kerry Bouffioux (1573)<br/>
Hes playing his lame blow up the Bunker deck that hes been playing forever.  I start Oppressive Enforcement and immediatly start tracking stuff around.  He starts Battle Plan which prevents me from draining early on Ralltiir.  By the time I flip, he has the Bunker out w/ Blow Up The Bunker on it and like 8 guys at the Endor Landing Platform.  I pop out Igar in Tempest 1, with Evax and Ozzel for attrition bait and battle.  I draw a 5 and a 4, Ralltiir turns it into a 12.  He loses like 3 dudes and I lose Ozzel (he has Insurrection out).  On my next turn I drop Vader w/ Stick and Tarkin and battle.  I just wipe him out from here on out.  He can't drain because of his own Battle Plan and I have Zuckuss in Ship as well as Fett in Ship up at his Endor draining.  Full win by 19<br/>

Game 3 vs. Russell Hockenberry (1890)<br/>
Cool, me and Russ always always go top 2 in tournaments when we both play.  Its always a good match.  Hes playing his Ralltiir deck just like he did last tournament so I know what to do.  I get an ok draw, and I drop a twix a Nudj from deck and draw up.  He doesn't have any twix in his opening hand so hes in big trouble.  Second turn Obi-Wan Kenobi w/ Lightsaber shows up at Ralltiir Forest to do some draining.  He can't block that drain because he knows hes gonna get beatdown if he tries, so he tries to go on the other side of Ralltiir.  I drop Harc Seff and some assorted dudes over at the site adjacent to where hes draining and move Obi over.  He pops out Kashyyyk and 2 bounty hunter ships, and I already have my mains working hard on Ralltiir so he drains for a while.  I do pop out the Falcon at his docking bay, load up it up and send it off to Ralltiir and then over to Kashyyyk to stop it though.  Basically, I just drained on Ralltiir and prevented him from flipping.  I had my Oola thing going on the entire game so the only guys he got out were Evax, Ozzel, Mara and some AT-ST pilots.  Oola pretty much gave me the game here, her and my 16 activation a turn.  I win by 26.<br/>

HIGHS : Discovering that my deck can beat Throne Room, beating Russ<br/>
LOWS : none<br/>

Game 4 vs. Russell Hockenberry (1890)<br/>
Thats annoying playing people twice.  Anyways hes playing Throne Room and it doesn't look good for me.  I start Imperial Arrest Order.  He gets a GOD draw, getting his only Revolution, 2 twixes, a Nudj and several mains in his opening hand.  First turn he gets out both his Nudjes and Revolves my Ralltiir, and pops out Civil Disorder.  EVIL.  I pop out 2 twixes and the Forest from hand, then a site from my deck and draw and lose to Civil Disorder.  I have an AT-ST pilot, Arnet in hand and an AT-ST at this point.  His next turn he drops EPP Obi and ECC Lando to my Forest to drain some and draws.  I activate, pop out an AT-ST pilot from reserve, and both characters from my hand and I cancel his Civil Disorder.  I draw my only one left.  He drains and pops out Master Luke and battles me.  We both draw 0s for battle destiny, so I have to lose 1 and he moves Master Luke over to Obi's site.  I drain and get another site, and drop an AT-ST and load it up with Arnet and a pilot and drop a 2/0 from hand.  He has deployed 3 of his big guys already and he can't Nabrun to beat me down, so the only guys I'm scared of are Leia and Han.  Next turn he activates and drops Han and Leia to my Forest and moves over.  This was the biggest mistake he made all game.  I simply pop out a dude to the site that he controls to flip and then move him over so he doesn't get beatdown.  Now I'm draining for 2 and he for one then I stick out Kashyyyk and hes pretty much toast.  The Falcon shows up at my DBay and moves up with Han and Chewie aboard so I go searching for Zuckuss in Ship and drop him and battle.  I drew high enough so that he had to lose them both and then all I do is drain and move away from where hes gonna beat me down.<br/>

HIGHS : Beating Russell twice, Russell having a nice fluffy rating<br/>
LOWS : hmm, none<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 vs. Josh Rohrig (1645)<br/>
He starts RTP and Battle Plan and I start Imperial Arrest Order.  I get 2 twix in my opening hand 3 AT-STs too, cool.  I flip on the 4th turn with AT-STs at 2 sites and Ardan at the third.  His turn he pops out 8D8 and moves him to the Death Star docking bay, I deploy Igar and Tempest 1 and Trample him.  mwahahaha.  He sneaks past me somehow and pops out Momaw Nadon at the Corridor and Rescues Leia.  On my turn I drain, pop out Mara w/ stick and Come Here You Big Coward to stop the drain that Leia gives up and battle.  Smack Leia, draw a 7 for battle destiny and it clears his side (he drew a 1 so Mara stays).  On his turn he just deploys EPP Leia and EPP Han at the Yavin Docking Bay and moves her in.  bla bla bla all I do is drain and he tries to get Vader with suicide runs by Obi and Luke, never succeeding.<br/>

HIGHS : Winning<br/>
LOWS : None<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs. Josh Rohrig (1645)<br/>
He's playing a deck a lot like my Hunt Down, straight blue.  I pop out a Nudj and a twix and draw up, getting Boussh, on his turn he leaves a couple.  I activate, Revo his Meditation Chamber and then Boussh goes Undercover to his Holotheatre then breaks cover for a nice drain.  On his turn he pops out Vader w/ Stick and Presence of the Force on my Farm.  Obi shows up with his Stick and we both miss, I draw a 4 him a 3 so nothing happens.  Next turn 4-LOM w/ gun shows up and he steals my stick with Weapon Levitation.  I draw a 5 and he draws a 3 so I lose Obi and he loses Vader.  Next turn another Obi comes down as well as Spiral + Oola + Wedge at my Rendezvous Point.  Hes activating like 6 a turn and I Oola him every turn and drain for 2.  I spread to his sites and drain there, knowing that he can't beat me down.  Win by 16<br/>

So I take yet another tournament going 6-0, I have quite a streak going for me going into Origins.  Russell Hockenberry comes in 2nd at 4-2, followed by Jeremy Stacy and Josh Rohrig.  When big D updates my rating, it looks like I will break the top 100 in the world for the first time at 1947.  Not bad when you're stuck playing guys 200 points below 1500 and such, huh? </font></td>
