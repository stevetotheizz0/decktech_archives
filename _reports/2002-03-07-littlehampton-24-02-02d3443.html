<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">At last our first tournament of the New Year and it was also a new experience as none of us had played a sealed deck before, it may also be the last one that we do as they may become even more hard to come by April. As normal Chris Vader69 Seymour called round and we discussed cards that we would like to get in the packets. I would have liked an Obi-Wan Kenobi from premiere as he could hold a site by himself or some Arconas as they are great! The most exciting part has to be opening the packets and building your deck as you do not know what you are going to get in the packets and if your deck is going to work. We were given the sealed deck, 2 packets of Cloud City and 1 Packet of Jabbas Palace. Here are my decks that I played with on the day:<br/>

<br/>
1st game: Light side Vs Carl Jode Jenner: He started with Mos Eisley which was a nice drain for me!. My main drains came from jundland wastes and I just reacted to his using the Skiff. Other drains came from space where I had two ships at separate locations and he came down with a load of ships but I just Hyper Escaped, I love that Card. I had also discovered a good combo with the Saurin piloting the Skiff with that effect that makes Characters warriors which made him power seven by himself! In the end I won by nine but it was the start of a good tournament for me as this put me in first place!<br/>
<br/>
2nd game: Light Side Vs Jacob Keet: I think Jacob Started off with Corulag which in my opinion is bad as there are no locations for it, this may have signalled though that he had a lot of troopers! The game progressed evenly as we both were losing the same amount to force drains. It was only at the end when he initiated battle where both of us had the same power and It all went down to battle destiny, unfortunately for Jacob I drew a six to his zero which signalled the end. I won be 2 in the end, which puts me on 4 (+11)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3rd game: Light Side Vs Micheal Bentley: This was a nightmare! I could not get my characters out early enough and he deployed loads to all of the good draining locations if I deployed anyone they just got beat up! I had some drains in space though and one on the ground but he had the upper hand. I lost by 10, which now puts me 4 (+1). This is what is frustrating about sealed deck; you can lose to people who you would not normally lose to. This though gives the lesser able players the opportunity to shine above the rest but most of all it is a challenge of one players deck building skills!<br/>
<br/>
4th game: Dark Side Vs Chris Vader69 Seymour: Chris had lost his last three games and knew he could not come in a high position. Chris had one of the best Light Side starting locations in this environment, Obi- Wans Hutt. Chris also had a bunch of good characters the most annoying was the arconas as they can react away from a battle. Half way through the game he massed a Nabrun leids beatdown with a handful of power 1 characters to my even fewer power 1 characters I was getting beat and there was nothing I could do about it. Throughout the game I was draining in space for one at Tatooine but he was retrieving using Figrin darn who is a great power 1 character for this environment.  Finally he moved the arconas to my biggest drain and cackled with glee! Fortunately this was the last game I would be losing today, it was by 22! This put me on 4 (-21)<br/>
<br/>
5th game: Dark Side VS Carl Jode Jenner: My only mistake on this game was deploying the Cloud city site as he came down with the CC Leia and a Jedi Lightsaber and for the whole game drained for three at the Carbonite Chamber. I on the other hand saw that he deployed all of his characters to Cloud City so I deployed to Tatooine where the real drains lie and massed a drain of five. It was a drain race that I was going to win. Unfortunately Carl could not pull out his other Cloud City sites to spread out to, if he had it would have been closer. Carl looked like to have had the luck with the packets, including Leia he also had a Falcon, which he managed to withhold his excitement and keep secret! I won by 6, which put me on 6 (-15)<br/>
<br/>
 6th game: Dark Side VS Jacob Keet: At this point I knew that I could not win but you cannot throw games away and I was not going to play any different than I would If I could win. We were both playing on Tatooine but it came down to the fact of who could get the most characters down as fast as possible to move to the opponents location and cancel their drain, he moves away because he is scared of my pitiful little band and I get a drain. The game went like that with the occasional battle when he thought he could beat me and sometimes he did. A very enjoyable game that ended in a +9 victory to me. This finished me on 8 (-6) <br/>
<br/>
Here are the final standings for the tournament:<br/>
<br/>
1st: Matt Hardy (Not a Wrestler!). Matt is the tournament director and he deserved to win as he had not won for a while. He declined to take the prize and so we had 2 draw prizes. His final points and differential were: 10 (+47), which is good for this environment as you start with 31 life force.<br/>
<br/>
2nd: Jordan Rogue 2Thomas. Jordan had it in the bag until he lost a game and Will failed to beat Matt. Jordan had some bad stuff in his packets such as Besieged and a Death Star Tractor Beam but he managed to come second. Unfortunately I did not play Jordan and did not know what his decks were like. His final points and differential were: 10 (+33)<br/>
<br/>
3rd: Me: I had only lost 2 games but I came third with a minus differential. I had a good start until mid tournament when I lost 2 games in a row and ruined my chances of winning. I had some good cards in my packets (not boosters) such as a Smuggler Wedge but no Obi-Wan or Vader! I won the Second draw prize which was a foil Sense. My final points and differential were: 8 (-6). This was a scraped placing as I was the only one with a minus differential in the top 5!<br/>
<br/>
4th: Chris Vader69Seymour: After losing his first three games with his Dark Side, his Light side fared much better by winning the last three and scraping 4th place. Chris won the first draw prize, which was a foil Houjix. His final points and differential were: 6 (+16). Chris was the first of 4 players to finish on 6 points so it was very close at mid table. <br/>
<br/>
5th: William Wood: Will tends to have no consistency with his placings at our tournaments and is very erratic. Under different circumstances he could have done better but then so could we all. Wills final points and differential were: 6 (+17)<br/>
<br/>
6th: Jacob Keet: Put up a challenge against me and did well to get 6 points. Again its the luck of the cards that you get determines your winning chances. Jacobss final points and differential were: 6 (-6)<br/>
<br/>
7th: Ed Bentley: Ed done well considering it was his first tournament. And to beat more experienced players shows some promise. Eds final points and differential were: 6 (-5), a card behind Jacob shows again how close it was! From what I saw did the worst in the packets with rubbish like hopping mad. <br/>
<br/>
8th: Michael Bentley: Unfortunately this is Michaels average placing at a regular tournament, just above rival Carl. His final score was: 4 (-32)<br/>
<br/>
9th: Carl JodeJenner: Unfortunately for Carl its last place for him 6 cards behind Michael but 2 more points would have done it. His final score was: 4 (-38).<br/>
<br/>
Apart from an exception (Chris) these are the average placings for a normal tournament, which is interesting as we were playing in a very different format than usual. Our next tournament will be E1 only and there will be loads of Invasion decks about. If you could come along we always welcome new players, a new challenge or a new victim for the slaughter! Littlehampton West Sussex in the Naboo region. If you want to say hi, want to talk decks or have a fit sister for loan then D-mail me.<br/>
