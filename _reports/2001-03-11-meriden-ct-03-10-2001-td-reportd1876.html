This tournamnet was great! We had a terrific turnout of 22 people. There is not mcu for me to say about this tournamnet because I spent most of my available time teachng a new player (Ashley) some of the finer skills of the game. To me this is more important than watching other players games.<br/>
<br/>
I was very surpised to see a lot of EBO &amp; MWYHL decks... Most of the winners today were playing Huntdown/BHBM/Scum decks for Dark and WYS/Hidden Mains/EBO for dark. And of Course I cannot forget to mention Karl’s Rumors Deck taht he always plays and Always wins with...<br/>
<br/>
Most Memorable Moment of the Tournamnet:<br/>
  Dan Long Stealing Starships in Sabaac.<br/>
