<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hello everyone,  <br/>
<br/>
Well, this is my first report so please rate it on the report not the spelling or grammer, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Well here goes:<br/>
<br/>
pre-tourny stuff:<br/>
<br/>
On...lets see....I guess it was last wednsday Cat asked me if I wanted to go to this tatooine draft in ventura, I thought "Gee wiz! A draft! Ventura? Great prize support, Sure!"  <br/>
Tournement day:<br/>
I woke up needing a shower and a haircut, I got both, found my Yankees shirt (which is a little league shirt from when I was ten, which just kicks a-s-s!), and went to the top of my hill around 10:15, Chris picked me up with Ernest already in the car. We needed to stop at the bank so I could play in the tournement and eat lunch.  We got to Cat’s around 10:30.  Now keeping in mind it’s normally a 45 minute drive to ventura.  We got there around 10:50.  Thanks Chris.  The tournement started at noon so we killed time at McDonalds where I ate my fries, Cat gave me his then and I had a stomach ache the rest of the day.  We get to ralph’s and get all settled in for the tournement, to my suprise a female show’s up to the tournment, this is going to be the first time I have ever seen a woman play star wars.  So yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Drafting:<br/>
<br/>
We got 4 packs of Tatooine and 2 packs of Jabba’s palace.  I was called for dark, I got two rares out of the whole thing, Sebulba and Ephant mon.  Pretty good.I also alot of characters, and drafted no pit droids cause they stunk.  I guess Marco from Santa Barbara got not only a Obi-Wan but a Qui-gon also.  He got 4th out of 6 people....go figure.  So yeah, we built decks and here we go. Oh, BTW, we also got to play with 3 battle grounds and dark got to play with Darth w/stick and light got to play with luke w/stick.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:<br/>
<br/>
The one girl (I am so sorry I do not remember her name) LIGHT vs. Me DARK<br/>
<br/>
I start off with Tatooine: Jabba’s palce she starts with Mos Espa.  I get a god hand playing both Sebulba and pulled Ehpant Mon with the AC (which I got with Jabba’s palace).  She then comes down with Qui-Gon Jinn and beat down Sebulba but Ephant mon survived to see another day. I then play the Ghana Gleemort.  She stayed in the AC for a while while I drained, stopping her drain of two by just losing one.  I don’t remember in detail what happened after that but it ended up like this: She chased me around for a long time, (I had to go to the bathroom all during this) draining me, I stop the drains we are now down to Ghana Gleemort vs. Qui-gon in the chamber, Lathe vs. scrub, alien with form mallet vs.Shimi, my guy draining for one, she can’t drain me anymoer, my turn, I drain for one, game.<br/>
<br/>
FW +1 (1)<br/>
<br/>
High: Two things, Ghana Gleemort won me the game, and seeing a girl playing.<br/>
Lows: I felt like my blatter was going to explode during the whole game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
<br/>
Marco LIGHT vs. Me DARK<br/>
<br/>
Marco and I always have fun games, making fun of each other during of each other and pulling cards from our pockets that ethier don’t match the side we are playing (E.g. Mara Jade when your playing light) or cards that don’t really make any sense (E.g. Seven of nine from star trek).  I don’t remember much from this game, although I do remember him putting down Luke w/stick, Obi, and scrub at his Cantina (which he started).  I said ok, played Ghana Gleemort, Sebulba, Ephant mon, and Weequy skiff master on two skiffs sitting outside the cantina draining for two and stopping his drains.  He tried looking through his deck to find something then I used podracer collision to make a interrupt out of play, that was good.  but yeah, using pit crew to check his hand for characters, and when he had none I spread and drained for six or something and won by 11.<br/>
<br/>
FW +11 (13)<br/>
<br/>
High:  Making a interrupt out of play, going to the bathroom at the "book nook" before the game and making fun of Marco.<br/>
Lows: Not much, Sebulba died though before turn 5 though due to attrition in a battle trying to wipe out my guys, Sebulba has now died twice.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:<br/>
<br/>
Ernest LIGHT vs Me DARK<br/>
<br/>
Ernest dosen’t know it but he is a very good player, I have a very very bad memory so lemme just some up some high lights.  Ghana Gleemort IS god.  I pulled him in my starting hand along with a Gamorrean axe and a skiff, so I stuck him on the skiff draining for alot, stuffing his drains, and reacting everywhere.  He kept on pulling 5’s and 6’s as destinys but I beat him down with power so it dosen’t really matter when he pulled a 6 vs. my 28 power.  I hit him with 8 overflow wiping out his characters.  But yeah, this whole game was ulgy because I learned about the react on the skiff so I was reacting everywhere and killing everything.  I drained him out and won by 17.<br/>
<br/>
FW +17 (30)<br/>
<br/>
High: Ghana Gleemort is the greatest card ever!!!!<br/>
Lows: None really.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up getting 2nd out of six people getting four Tatooine packs.  Which is cool.  <br/>
<br/>
