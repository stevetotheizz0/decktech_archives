<br/>
I had just gotten back to school after an uneventful summer spent in the vacationing bliss of Sioux Falls, SD.  I’d just begun to relive the great fun of 8 am classes when I realized that Pete was holding an EP1 booster draft in Rochester.  I’m always up for SW, plus I needed to trade for some stuff.  I went down and showed up at the last possible moment as the 13th person, so Pete played to make it 14.  I drafted in the group of six as dark.  I got passed some good stuff, but didn’t have a whole lot of good cards, but enough to work.  Here’s the deck.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
As it turned out, lots of Qui-Gon’s were pulled so many were playing Hyperdrive decks.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Senate Pile w/Maul vs. Ryan Driscoll’s Hyperdrive pile w/Qui-Gon<br/>
<br/>
I start Senate stuff with the Battle Plains and, for some odd reason, Neimoidian Advisor and His Name is Anakin.  He starts Hyperdrive stuff with Mindful for The Camp.  First turn, Tikkes and Edcel went down to the Senate.  He pulled Tat Qui-Gon and moved him to the Junkyard.  I dropped Adem’Thorn for the flip and deployed both political effects.  I canceled his drain but still had to stack one.  I let something slip about dropping a beatdown, so he reinforced Qui-Gon with a handmaiden and some random alien, the 3-2 Ithorian, I think, as well as an Eopie, which I forgot he couldn’t deploy due to his objective.  So the Maul in my hand went, instead, to the battle Plains to drain for two the rest of the game.  After that it was uneventful.  I kept canceling his drain and stacking a card while making him lose 3 a turn.  He brought Palpatine and some random scrub against Maul, but they got crushed.  Eventually, I dropped the Marketplace with P-59 there and he moved over his guys and we started chasing each other around.  My quick damage was just too much for him, though.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+16)<br/>
2(+16)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Second turn flip, Maul in opening hand.  Him only getting three characters all game.<br/>
Bad: Using Yeb-Yeb to peek at Thrown Back three times.  Getting nine cards stacked on Credits.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Senate Pile w/Maul vs. Andrew Stenson’s Pile<br/>
<br/>
I started the same thing sans Neimoidian Advisor.  He starts Watto’s Junkyard with Mindful and Security Control.  First turn Orn Free and Tikkes go to the Senate, draw.  He deploys a Dbay and picks up.  I flip second turn and save some.  He draws.  Maul goes to the Battle Plains where he should be relatively safe.  At least, you would think so.  He drops Panaka with a Naboo Blaster and a scrub to battle Maul.  He shoots and draws a 5, hitting Maul.  I take out the scrub with attrition and try to rethink my strategy.  P-59 takes Tey How and goes to the Marketplace for some retrieval.  He couldn’t get any characters together and I kept canceling the Battle Plains drain for as long as I could.  I can’t recall any other battles and I was retrieving, whereas he wasn’t.  It was over quick.  <br/>
<br/>
FW (+12?)<br/>
2(+28?)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Winning.  Senators are beastly.<br/>
Bad: Maul got shot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Senate Pile w/Maul vs. Random guy’s Hyperdrive Pile w/Master Qui-Gon<br/>
<br/>
I start my good stuff and he starts Hyperdrive with Mindful and The Camp.  First turn Tikkes and Edcel, you know the rest.  He didn’t have enough force for Master Q, so he drew a few and saved a few.  Passel flips and No Civility takes Edcel in to hand for my Political Effects.  He drops Qui-Gon from reserve and moves him over.  Maul does not go to the Battle Plains, however.  I couldn’t get him the entire game.  I spent most of my time putting his hand in his used pile and circulating my senators and interrupts.  P-59 went to the Marketplace to begin retrieval.  He drained, stacked, and deployed an Eopie (I’m still an idiot) to the marketplace.  Next turn a handmainden and the evil docking bay chick come down.  He draws a 6, but I subtract three to retain my immunity and his handmaiden dies.  Next turn I kill the Dbay chick.  I got my guard and a couple senators down to drain at City Outskirts but he kept chasing them around.  Eventually he ran out of force to do much of anything and I just outdrained him.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+15)<br/>
6(+43?)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Quick flip, winning.<br/>
Bad: Getting chased around by scrubs.  Stacking eight cards on Credits.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Senate Pile w/Maul vs. Pete Jacobson’s Senate Pile w/AI Master Q and AI Mace<br/>
<br/>
I start my stuff.  He starts senate stuff with City Outskirts and Mindful for Security Control.  I decide to abandon the senate first and put P-59 at the Battle Plains first turn.  He deploys Liara and Yarua, I believe, to flip first turn.  I draw for some reinforcements and find I have the hand to go to the senate.  He backs up with Mas Amedda, but it doesn’t matter.  Passel and Edcel go to the Senate with a Guard and Tey How for forfeit with one saved up.  He battles and I play No Civility to put Amedda in used with Edcel.  The guard boosts Passel’s politics so neither has a majority.  My destiny kills Liana, his kills Tey How. That leaves Yarua staring down Passel and my Guard.  My turn, Yarua finds that he has Little Real Power and Tikkes finds his way to the senate.  Battle, Guard boosts, destiny of 3.  9-0, Yarua +5.  His turn, Qui-Gon goes to kill P-59, but he’s huring becuse he lost a good handful of senators.  I get Edcel back down to flip and No Civility to get him in my hand to cancel his drain of two.  Lt. Williams joins Qui-Gon and he draws for reinforcements.  Mas and another senator go to the Coruscant: Dbay, but we’re both running low on force.  When he has no hand, Orn Free goes to the Marketplace.  Why I didn’t put him at the City Outskirts, I don’t know.  Not only are we running low on force, we’re also running low on time.  He has five force left with no hand and I have four with no hand when time is called on my turn.  I drain for three, getting him down to two.  Draw No Civility with Tikkes, then use it to take him in to hand and draw another Tikkes while putting Edcel, who was on the drain canceling effect, in used pile.  Three in force, two in hand.  He drained for two at the Plains (canceled), one at the Swamp and one at the Coruscant: Dbay.  We each have two force left, but he has fewer in lost pile, so he wins.  That sucked, since I would have won next turn.  Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
TL (-2)<br/>
6(+41)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Winning the Senate battle.<br/>
Bad: Master Q is a beast<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My differential was good enough to get me first.  In second were two dark players and one light, all with 6(+31).  I ended up beating Ryan again in a Final Confrontation to take first and get the foily Jap Vader and the Maul beanie and some other cool stuff.  Unfortunately, my car died on the way back to school, so I had to get a new alternator.  Thankfully, the old one had a life-time warranty.  I also had enough insurance on my computer to cover the display.  Sweet.  Anyway, thanks for the read.<br/>
