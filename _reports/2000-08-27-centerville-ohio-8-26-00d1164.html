This tournament I decided I'd rather take something that I made myself then some net deck that every has seen.  I threw together an ISB deck I thought was decent and a Profit deck.  I borrowed some tech from Martin Akesson's Profit, but the deck was still way different.  On to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs. Russell Hockenberry (Ralltiir Ops)<br/>
I don't want to go into this game, I played like a moron.  I should win this match up but I played like a scrub and I lost.  Losing Home One off the top of your reserve deck like 4th turn = not good.  It was my only ship in the deck.  I also let him beat up on Obi and Luke, when I should have simply moved them to where Igar was.  Instead I let Vader slash Obi and he drew a 6 for battle destiny.  That sucked.  Maybe the post-game football party on Friday wasn't such a hot idea.  Lose by 10.<br/>
<br/>
0 (-10)<br/>
<br/>
HIGHLIGHTS : hmmm, well I enjoyed myself Friday night<br/>
LOWLIGHTS  : Playing like a scrub.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs. Matt Sato (Hidden Base/Our Most Desperate Hour)<br/>
Matt plays off the wall decks all the time, so I don't know what to expect from him.  He starts Hidden Base, Strike Planning, Wise Advice and Squassin.  First turn he nabs Lando and drops him and the Falcon to Rendezvous Point, not moving him over (mistake number 1).  I set  up 2 dudes and my 1/0 docking bays, and get ready to start draining next turn.  Next turn he drops Wedge in Ship and Tycho in Ship and moves all 3 ships over to Endor.  I set up a 2 drain and draw up to find 2 more ISBs so I can flip.  His turn he drains and I lose an ISB off the top.  Whenever I drain I see him losing starship weapon related cards.  Thats not even cool.  Now I gotta watch myself, but fortunately he loses like 3 weapons in one force drain off the top.  He never comes down to Endor where I am getting him for 5 a turn, instead he chooses to drain at CC Lower Corridor for 3 (note to self, add an Undercover) and Kessel and Kiffex.  It came down to me retrieving an ISB every turn and me trying to block his drains with my ships.  I win a close one by 8.<br/>
<br/>
2 (-2)<br/>
<br/>
HIGHLIGHTS : Winning<br/>
LOWLIGHTS  : Me and Matt both know I probably shouldn't have won that game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs. Shane -dunno last name- (Space drain)<br/>
He starts Endor and saves up a turn.  Next turn he drops a ship at Kashyyyk and a ship at Endor.  I wait for him to drain me a bit until I flip.  I set up the Shuffle, but hes hitting me for 4 a turn in space which has to be handled with.  Home One with Lando and Wedge goes and wipes out a system, also giving me an extra drain and another Profit damage.  Hes only hitting me for 2, I'm getting him for 12 a turn.  Win by 30.<br/>
<br/>
4 (+28)<br/>
<br/>
HIGHLIGHTS : winning<br/>
LOWLIGHTS : None I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs. Matt Meily (TIGIH, with Eloms and Catapult stuff)<br/>
He's playing TIGIH, basically I find Vader, capture Luke, and pound on his Eloms.  He tries to do the ASP Ewok Catapult junk and I just Trample the ASP droids.  I only saw one ship and maybe 4-5 characters all game.  I drain him for 10 a turn.  Most people win when they are draining for 10 a turn.  Win by 17<br/>
<br/>
6 (+15)<br/>
<br/>
HIGHLIGHTS : Winning<br/>
LOWLIGHTS  : Having 15 cards in my hand at the end of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 vs. (I forget this dudes name, my bad) (Dark Deal Clouds)<br/>
He starts Bespin and CC: Casino, with no objective.  I find the cards I need and free Han third turn with Master / saber, Ben / saber and move out to JP.  He starts draining in the Clouds with the Obsidian TIEs and at the Casino where he has like literally 16 characters for about 4 force a turn but its starting to add up.  I set up the shuffle and he drops U-3P0 to my Cantina.  He finally spreads a little bit to the Port Town District, so I drop Order to Engage and Nabrun over.  He battles me and I hit all of his guys, play I Know and Gift of the Mentor.  Clear him out, next turn I drain for 4 and Profit for 1 and thats all.  Win by 17.<br/>
<br/>
8 (+32)<br/>
<br/>
HIGHLIGHTS : Winning<br/>
LOWLIGHTS  : I lost Home One off the top... Again.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs. Nobody<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I had to drop to visit my family.  I think I would have won the tournament if I had played my last game.  I couldn't have played any of the big guys that I was really worried about.  That sucks.<br/>
<br/>
HIGHLIGHTS : None.<br/>
LOWLIGHTS : Dropping.<br/>
<br/>
So I finish at 4-1, here are the final standings:<br/>
<br/>
1. Russell Hockenberry<br/>
2. Matt Sato<br/>
3. Frank Lamantia<br/>
4. Dunno<br/>
5. John Veasey </font></td>
