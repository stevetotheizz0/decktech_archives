<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I couldn't decide which DS deck I wanted to take.  I was torn between ral ops, huntdown, raithal numbers, and isb space.  I chose Ralltir Operation, which as it would turn out was a wrong decision.  For LS I played a tatooine mains deck with some tech in it.  I showed up, saw the expected talent in the room, continued to doubt my DS, but decided to play with it anyway, and then we got started. I also thought that I could pick up some rating points today, but I think i may have lost a couple.  I was 1904, let's see where I am after it gets updated.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs Aman Seth(1581) Huntdown deck	<br/>
	He starts huntdown, no duel, arrest order.  I start obi's hut and tosche, just because I don't care.  He draws up first turn, I draw 1.  2nd turn he draws them all, I drop Jeroen Webb and EPP Leia to cancell visage.  Next turn he activates and says go.  I think about putting EPP Luke down with them, but say the hell with it and draw a couple.  He then drops Vader, Igar and Mara, pulls her saber.  I play double agent, draw a 5 and mara dies.  he battles, I lshoot igar, and draw a 5, he draws a 4.  I lose webb and leave leia to drain.  Next I drop Ben kenobi to tosche with epp Luke.  He doesn't do a whole lot after that except lose some force.  I win by 29<br/>
2(+29)<br/>
highlights: LS deck working exactly as planned, double agenting Mara<br/>
Lowlights: none<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 DS vs Wojchiech's(2005) LS 2/0 anti-tech deck<br/>
	I really wasn't ready to play woj yet, especially with an unproven deck that I wasn't sure was going to work for me.  He starts Obi's hut.  First couple of turns are really slow, he's complaining about the deploy costs to Ralltir, but he had thrown down Goo nee tay and restricted deployment, plus some 2/0 sites, so he really had no right to complain with 13 force on turn 5, while I got 7. It was a very slow paced game.  I never flipped ralltir, he saved up and dropped EPP Han and Leia and chewbacca to ralltir and beatdown, drawing 14 for his 3 destiny.  I caught him off-guard in space with zuckuss in mist hunter, but got greedy and stayed a turn too long, and zuckuss got hurt.  As a last ditch effort I sent Vader in his shuttle to space, but it was way too late.  loss by 22<br/>
2(+7)<br/>
highlights:performing well early in the game against a top-ranked player<br/>
lowlights: playing my ds deck, and making several late game mistakes which completely screwed me out of any chance of winning the game.  Getting out-teched<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 LS vs Dark Jedi(pat brennan(1700's player)1547) tatooine mains.<br/>
	Pat had decided that he wants to start his rating over at 1500, since he has ratings on decipher as Pat Brennan and Patrick Brennan and he's upset that he doesn't have the full amount of rating points that he deserves.  Imagine how anyone who played him that day felt since he is a good player and none of us will get the correct amount of points for beating him. That;s why we now call him Dork Jedi.<br/>
	So he starts jabba's palace to my obi's hut.  I convert his palace and he plays lar's moisture farm.  First turn, he deployed audience chamber(damn so much for converting) and just drew.  I draw a couple and save.  He drops Vader and Lobel to lars.  I drop EPP luke cause I have Out of Commission in hand and want to take out vader, drop draw their fire and battle.  He flips his one loss from the top, Dlots, so I play OOC right there.  Now all I have to do is get the Vader off the table,but I swing and miss and draw a 3.  Vader lives.  he drops Djas Puhr and moves him to Obi's hut .  I send Tawss to battle him, retrieve artoo that I lost from his force drain, but only draw a 2. he draws a 3, so he just loses some cards.  I had deployed r-3po and now move him into AC to play A gift.  next turn i drop epp leia and shoot djas, he draws a 1, so leia lives.  I also sent EPP Obi after Vader, and finally got rid of him.  He didn't do much more after that.  win by 20<br/>
4+27<br/>
Highlights:using a gift, not putting back shock to track for destiny and them him playing scanning crew 15 seconds later.<br/>
Lowlights: getting 3 rating points for a victory against a much better player than 1547.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs Pete Flamini(1736)'s Yavin 4 mains<br/>
	Well, Pete just basically lit up my ralltir deck again.  He was getting about 19 force from his 2/0 sites, and he altered bad feeling have I early.  He got his Epp's and had enough force to follow me wherever I went.  I didn't have enough to put together the troops and counter attack, so he just basically handed me my ass.  I really can't put in a specifics, because the game was over pretty quickly.   I thought about next game just not even playing the objective, leaving it in my box, and starting with the death star.  loss by 27.   Pete, John, Greg and I went next door to get some food, and we thought about all just dropping and going to play basketball since it was a really nice day(they told me about the game the 3 of them and Ray Bordier played the weekend before though, great story)<br/>
4(0)<br/>
Highlights: only losing by 27, getting some food.<br/>
Lowlights: the whole game was equally low for me.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 vs Thomas hermley-keen's(1658) Ral ops<br/>
	Tom's a new local player who has been playing for almost a year now.  I kind of helped him out a bit when he was just starting in tournaments, and he is developing into a quality player.  His deck building has improved and so has his playing ability, he just has a dendancy to get anxious and go away from his gameplan.  <br/>
	Game starts out, he forgets to pull a site and just draws(oops).  I drop tawss khaa to tosche for extra force.  He pulls a site, drops some other locations and saves up.  I drain and then draw 2.  He drops tempest 1 and igar to battle tawss(a decision we both later agreed was not a great idea).  he draws a 2 and 1, I draw a 4.  He sacs the whole thing, and I lose tawss and 2 cards.  next turn i drop ben kenobi to tosche and wait.  He deploys a tempest scout to the middle ralltir site, pulls and at-st pilot, drops nemet to 1 site and another 2/2 guy to the last site to flip.  He leaves 1 force.  I activate, drop draw their fire, drop EPP han and leia to the 2/2 guy, and melas to nemet.  I know he was planning on reacting, but also thought he might have a ghhhk.  he reacts to han and leia, loses all of it and I lose han.  Melas takes out nemet.  objective flips back and ralltir is mine.  win by 30<br/>
6(+30)<br/>
Highlights: LS deck going undefeated 6+79, working like it should.<br/>
Lowlights: having to go play DS again, beating a guy that I like alot.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs Andrew Parks(1886) HB/Asteroid Sanctuary.<br/>
	I was surprised to see Andrew show up, but we kind of expected him.  He doesn't play many local events, but just shows up for the big events when his schedule allows it.  I knew he would be playing asteroids, it's kind of his go-to LS.  I went first, pulled a site,deployed Wampa cave and drew 2.  He pulled Anoat, dropped a big one and a sector, an x-wing and sanctuaried.  I deployed Fett in Slave one to the sector and moved him over.  His turn, I forget to draw against his x-wing, I lose 1 for sanctuary.  he deploys another sector, drops 4 x-wings and battles.  I make him lose one and i lose 4 cards to damage.  he draws against fett, misses.  I deploy Lt. Cmd Ardan to ralltir and draw a few.  His turn I draw against the x-wings, and blow up 3 of the 4.  He gets some more systems out so now he has 5.  the 4th x-wing tries to run.  Sanctuary #1 cancelled.  My turn I deploy to the other two ralltir sites and flip,  leave fett where he is to prevent another sanctuary.  He deploys x-wings to Coruscant and Kiffex and moves one to my Death Star. I draw against the 4th x-wing and it dies.  My turn, he gets fett with asteroid destiny, i drop zuckuss in mist hunter, with ds-61-2 as another pilot, first strike, and battle, he can't houjix so he loses 5 cards, move to coruscant.  he sets up another sanctuary, this one I alter with mara(on ralltir), and he had flipped one for a force drain the turn before(3 down, how many more to go).  He shuffles his x-wings around and draws for another sanctuary.  I force drain some more, and follow his x-wings.  he sets up a #4 sanctuary and I can't find any more ships(I keep activating the BUS), but I point man it.  He was totally surprised that I had a point man in my deck.  I pointed out all the other cards that it cancelled.  I find the BUS, drop it against an x-wing, lateral damage, draw and add 3 for Ral Ops and the games over.  win by 13<br/>
8(+43)<br/>
highlights:cancelling 4 sanctuaries, especially with only 4 ships in the deck.  WINNING WITH THIS DECK<br/>
lowlights:none<br/>
<br/>
So I finish 8(+43), take 5th place and am disappointed.  I don't know what I was thinking with the DS deck. I gave Lolli my dagobah packs so he could go play ghetto war with Pat, Greg and Pete.  Congrats to Scott and Mike, maybe by RamapoCon I can put together a DS to match my LS and put my money where my mouth is.<br/>
