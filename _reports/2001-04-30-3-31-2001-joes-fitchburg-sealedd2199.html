Figured Kirdo would help with the Sandwhirl but it never got out....<br/>
<br/>
Quick rememberances of the matchups....<br/>
<br/>
Paul Laudenbach -- I won 2+27, started with Uh-Oh which didn’t help --Lando did his usual whoop-ass and saved the day, we got in a couple of good battle, Paul got me for about 8 force<br/>
early off but I recovered and drained in space at his kessel.<br/>
<br/>
Steve Anderson -- I won 2+30, started w/Crash Site, which saved me the entire game - I was losing skiffs then getting them back and deploying them<br/>
all thru the game -- worked so well, I’m thinking of an actual tourney light deck with this effect to boot!<br/>
<br/>
3rd game - Paul’s relative - forgot the name, so I’ll call him "Stubby"--- I won 2 + 9, a couple of good battles and a crappy draw hand that was all effects and interrupts got me started slow..plus<br/>
the fact that I underestimated a player who I’d nvr played before, so I figured "easy win."<br/>
<br/>
Joey Sotille -- I won 2 +47. This is Joe’s son and being the big bully that I am sometimes, I gave him a quick drain and beatdown on the 2-3rd turns....<br/>
got Worrt out and he lost almost all of his characters by 5th turn.... gave him a Luke Skywalker card from my folder afterwards to keep him interested in the game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All in all a fun tourney - I won 8 +113 (yipes!) and took home a couple of packs of R2.<br/>
Also, we discovered that the store had one of those 6 rares in each pack of Reflections one so we bought a bunch of those.<br/>
<br/>
Hops:<br/>
I won with the biggest differential ever in a sealed.<br/>
Cheap space to play, beats $12 admission that I have to charge at Boxborough.<br/>
Joe doing another crack up job. Good price, good support for everyone.<br/>
Crash site memorial - hve to check that out again.<br/>
Lando vibro for being too strong<br/>
<br/>
Flops:<br/>
Only thing crappy about the guild is the guy charges FULL RETAIL PRICE PLUS TAX!!!<br/>
Lousy chairs - looks like someone’s grandma dropped a couple of deuces on the seats.<br/>
Joe running off for his job... was a bit rushed and the timed games some people had were bummers.<br/>
Lando vibro for being too strong </font></td>
