<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I must apologize for any typos: my ’n’ key sticks, so it might be wierd<br/>
at times.<br/>
<br/>
So I set the alarm for 7:00am and go to bed at around 4:00. I wake up to<br/>
Batman Beyond and Pokemon, then I drag myself out of bed, nuke a couple<br/>
Pop Tarts, count my decks again and again, and head off to the<br/>
tournament. This isn’t actually the Grand Slam; this is the 8-game Mega-Tourney, part of the Grand Slam weekend. I’ve been hyping myself up all week, telling myself I’m<br/>
gonna win it all and all that. I was ready to go! I had a new EBO deck<br/>
that has the potential to be a killer if I get it set up right, and I<br/>
have been working on my old PalpyOps from long ago for DS. As a note to<br/>
all my readers: Diamond sites are NOT dead unless you’re playing the<br/>
LS card! Same goes with numbers; it’s not retired unless you play the<br/>
card. I get to AZ Gamer and realize that my pop tarts are still in the<br/>
microwave. Oops. I see Andy Marcantel, David Teeters, and a couple other<br/>
buddies and fill out the decklist and command card. Brandon Allen<br/>
informs me that I put my email addy above my player ID and I need to<br/>
change it before he can put it on the command card. The lady next to me<br/>
rolls her eyes and just writes the information down. I tell Brett that I’m gonna win, and he encourages me instead of the laughter I was expecting. Cool! We finally get<br/>
settled for our first pairings.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1: PalpyOps vs. Matthew’s Hoth w/ elom reacts (not EBO)<br/>
I haven’t seen this guy before, so I don’t know what to think. There are<br/>
a lot of out-of-state players, but there are also newbies from AZ. I<br/>
decide before the game starts that I’m gonna open a can. I present to<br/>
you, ladies and gentlemen, God’s starting hand: Lord Vader, Palpy, Mara,<br/>
Mara’s Stick, Royal Guard x 2, Abyssian Ornament, and the Exec DB. I<br/>
pull the Prefect’s Office and the Coruscant DB from my deck, drop the<br/>
EDB, and a Royal Guard at each DB. He drew his Force into his hand. I<br/>
still don’t know what to think of him. I couldn’t set up Ralltiir<br/>
because I activated my Forest and Spaceport DB in my God-like generation<br/>
next turn. He deploys AFA in the deck after I deploy everybody, DRAT! I<br/>
have Fett in S1 in my hand, and I pop AFA in the generation. I activate<br/>
2 and use it to search for ghhhk. I’m gonna deploy Fett on the ground<br/>
with his little "army" and soak the damage. IT’S NOT THERE! So I pull<br/>
U3PO instead and take the 4 damage. He tries to give someone a jedi<br/>
lightsaber to drain with, but Weapon Of The Ingrate takes care of that.<br/>
Davod Jon an appearance and overpowered his army of 4, taking out<br/>
everything except a droid and sacrificing himself to the 3 attrition.<br/>
DRAT! I had a drain of 9 going to his 0, and there was nothing he could<br/>
do. I didn’t have enough Guards to make Abyssian work, but I should have<br/>
used Weapon Of The Ingrate to put the sabers and Pikes back in the deck.<br/>
Too bad.<br/>
<br/>
FW by 19<br/>
2(+19)<br/>
<br/>
PROS: I’m getting settled in. I’m not used to a tournament this big, but I’m getting relaxed now.<br/>
CONS: None, really. I kinda wish I had used my Weapon of Ingrate to add to my dif.<br/>
<br/>
In the middle of my Game 1, the large ominous shadow of Michael Girard<br/>
hovers over me and asks for my LS deck. I had counted this deck 10 times<br/>
over and over again; I know it’s 60 cards! I was worried sick about it.<br/>
Turns out I forgot to add the "x 2" to my YT-1300s, giving me a warning.<br/>
I take my deck back with a thousand apologies, feeling very glad we<br/>
didn’t abide by DecipherCon rules. Thanks again, Mike!<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2: EBO Capitals vs. Jonny’s BHBM<br/>
As we’re setting up our starting cards, Clint Hays beside me tells his<br/>
opponent not to stack his effects. If he does it again, it’s a game<br/>
warning! A couple jokes about the rules and penalties broke out, then we<br/>
started the game. As I’m typing this, it just doesn’t have the same<br/>
impact it did at the time. It was funny when it happened; I guess you<br/>
had to be there. Anyways...<br/>
So my hand consists of Strikeforce (you need it in EBO!), Chasm (a<br/>
painfully powerful card), Honor, and Menace Fades for effects, 2<br/>
capitals, Endor, and a Signal. Nothing to help get EBO going at all. I<br/>
deployed my effects, and he nearly choked when he read Chasm. "So, how<br/>
many Vaders are you playing with today?" It’s just awesome. He put IG88<br/>
w/, Dr. E, and Mara with her stick at a drain 3 location, so I signaled<br/>
for Undercover instead of Squad Assign and dropped my newly drawn<br/>
Cracken. I couldn’t stop pulling Signals, and it was kinda annoying.<br/>
Squadron Assign didn’t help at all because I couldn’t get a pilot or a<br/>
ship. I lost too much blue to drains, too. Cappy Han, Home 1, and the<br/>
Independence made quick work of Ozzel in the Exec, but allowed Zuckuss<br/>
to escape to Kiffex. Unfortunately, I wouldn’t get any more blue the<br/>
entire game. I gave him Luke JK from my lost pile as soon as Lord Vader<br/>
hit Endor to give him a little Direct Damage. Here’s where I’m a bad<br/>
player. He’s draining for 3 at each of 3 Endor sites; 1 icon, a +1, and<br/>
a saber. I have Menace Fades on the Table, Hoth belongs to me and Kiffex<br/>
I’m working on, and Obi is holding the 4th Marker. I didn’t cancel his<br/>
drain modifiers the entire game, and it killed me. I’m a bad player. I<br/>
don’t know what my cards do. Palpatine left his home on the DS2 for some<br/>
reason, I don’t know why. I would have won this game if I had known why<br/>
I put the cards in my deck that I did. Keep count; this is game 1 that I<br/>
should have won.<br/>
<br/>
FL by 13<br/>
2(+6)<br/>
<br/>
PROS: Definitely the starting hand! Seeing his face when he read Chasm.<br/>
CONS: Gee, there’s so many to list! I won’t forget Menace Fades again. I wish I remembered how to use spies.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3: PalpyOps vs. Mike’s HB w/out flip<br/>
This was by far the most fun game I played all day. Wedge RSL and Gen<br/>
Cal showed up in their respective ships at Tatooine, but I flipped, so<br/>
he didn’t have a drain. He pulled Dagobah and the Hutt, Tatooine, and<br/>
Alderaan, but that was it. I flipped turn 2. He tried to bring his EPP<br/>
army against my Royal Guards. I wouldn’t have minded being that I had<br/>
the ghhhk in my hand, but I decided to tell him that all his guys were<br/>
+2. He pulled back and waited a little. We battled all over space and on<br/>
the ground. Putting Palpy or LVader at the Prefect’s Office creates a<br/>
beast! My power 4, Def Value 4 Royal Guards were kicking all kinds of<br/>
butt. And Goo Nee Tay can’t touch em! He won our Sense/Alter war,<br/>
putting all my cancellers in my lost pile because I didn’t get out<br/>
Oppressive Enforcement in time, and he used Our Most Desparate Hour 3<br/>
times to retrieve 6 or 7 Force each time. He had to work for it because<br/>
CHYBC was on the table, but he managed. I flipped that objective back<br/>
and forth more times than I can remember. Fett in S1 and Bossk in Bus<br/>
took on Wedge and the Falcon, leaving Calrissian all alone against<br/>
Bossk. He deployed Nien Nunb and battled me, I played Res Luk, but he<br/>
Sensed it! That is the best use of that card; in space with the perm<br/>
pilots! They don’t count as bounty hunters, but the OR works with Bossk<br/>
and Fett. Anyway, that single battle probably lost me the game with the<br/>
amount of cards I lost. Time was called, and after a battle, I played<br/>
Abyssian Ornament, knowing full well that I only had 3 guards on the<br/>
table and my destiny was a 3. I just wanted the 5 in the deck and on the<br/>
top! Now, had I actually used it during that battle before I lost my 4th<br/>
royal guard, it would have been much better! Time was called on my<br/>
deploy phase, otherwise I would have grabbed Weapon of the Ingrate and<br/>
pulled 4 pikes and 2 sabers back in the deck. We counted; I had 11 cards<br/>
in the deck, and he had 12. :-(   Still counting? This is game #2 that I<br/>
should have won but didn’t because I’m a bad player. But this was a<br/>
completely awesome game. He had me sign his Sense in memory of our<br/>
little war.<br/>
<br/>
TL by 12<br/>
2(-6)<br/>
<br/>
PROS: This was a fantastic game. I played my strategy very well against him.<br/>
CONS: Having time called just after my control phase ended. Timing out in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay... I came into this not wanting to suck as bad as I did at<br/>
Pat’s tourney. At least I won a game today!<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4: EBO Capitals vs. Mike Sinclair’s Hunt Down w/ Please-Rape-Me<br/>
Duels<br/>
I hate playing Mike. He always beats me, even though it’s never by a<br/>
lot. But I’ve never won a game against him. Before the game, I get all<br/>
@#$%y with him in fun. I’ve got 5 characters, 4 of them pilots, and 2 of<br/>
them spies. How cool is that! He didn’t start No Escape, so I signaled<br/>
for Honor instead of cancelling Visage. Vader came to play on Hoth, and<br/>
I lured him under the shield as I deployed Obi to his CC to flip him.<br/>
Igar in Tempest 1 make short work of hero and Vader comes out of the<br/>
base to flip again. Jedi Luke wants to see if he can survive longer than<br/>
his mentor, so he visits the city in the sky next. All the while, EBO is<br/>
set up, but I’m only draining at Hoth because Zuckuss, IG88 w/, and 4LOM<br/>
w/ took control of Kiffex too early, and I’m not going anywhere near<br/>
that little combo. He eventually gets Bossk out to Hoth and moves the<br/>
Z-crew over. I know the true power of bounty hunter ships and realize<br/>
that he is getting 4 destinies, but for some reason I stay there. I was<br/>
hoping in those destinies he would get a dupe and lose it to Chasm, the<br/>
little effect hiding on the corner of the table. BUT NO! I draw a 3 and<br/>
a 2, and he draws 3 destiny 6 cards!!!!! And they’re all interrupts, so<br/>
Chasm doesn’t touch them! I got royally screwed, and there was nothing I<br/>
could do about it. He lost his droids, I lost nearly everything. I can’t<br/>
do much against attrition of 20! I’m not immune to that. He pulled<br/>
destiny 6 every time, and it was painful. Luke held his ground on CC the<br/>
entire game until I knew I was gonna lose, so I left him alone with<br/>
Igar. He pulls a couple destiny 6 cards again to my 5. It was fun, but<br/>
painful!<br/>

<br/>
PROS: Not losing by more<br/>
CONS: Playing Mike<br/>
<br/>
Remember when I said I didn’t want to screw up like I did in Pat’s<br/>
tourney? Well, it’s not looking good for our hero today.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 5: PalpyOps vs. Andy Marcantel’s MWYHL to 6<br/>
My starting hand had 3 docking bays in it. That’s not normal! I like<br/>
playing Andy; he knows how to have fun. I easily set up Ralltiir, but it<br/>
takes him 3 turns to begin training. Overseeing It Personally comes out<br/>
a turn too late, so I don’t get to double my drains. Fett blocks his<br/>
B-Wings at the system to flip me over, and he lands amidst the army. I<br/>
soon realize he’s playing a version of Chris Shaner’s MWYHL that I lost<br/>
to long ago before I really knew how to play. He’s holding Coruscant<br/>
with 7 B-Wings and S-Foils! When I finally get Bossk, Zuckuss, and 4LOM,<br/>
I take the trip to the center of the Old Republic. I also held onto a<br/>
ghhhk. We battled over and over again, but my recurring bounty hunter<br/>
ships and cool use of Res Luk was too much for him. He got beat off the<br/>
planet, and Fett held control for the rest of the game. He couldn’t draw<br/>
his test 5 destiny because he didn’t have a reserve deck (he was low on<br/>
cards), and he couldn’t retrieve his 10 because of CHYBC. Too bad! I<br/>
drained him out after a few turns. He’s always fun to play, and we<br/>
chatted with the guys beside us. My losing streak brought me to the fun<br/>
table!<br/>
<br/>
FW by 16<br/>
4(-3)<br/>
<br/>
PROS: I like Andy. He’s fun. And PalpyOps does it again. He was a couple places higher than me in round 3, so I’m glad I took it to him. Beating down the B-Wings<br/>
CONS: Letting him control Ralltiir with his b-wings for a turn.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 6: EBO Capitals vs. John Towner<br/>
He decided to concede the match to me before we started to go play Trek.<br/>
I still think leaving StarWars for Trek is blasphemy or something, but<br/>
hey, I’ve got 30 points and an even record at 3-3.<br/>
<br/>
FW by 30<br/>
6(+27)<br/>
<br/>
PROS: Hey, it’s 30 points!<br/>
CONS: Leaving SW for Trek? Come on!<br/>
<br/>
Yes folks, we’re still going! Our 4 round / 8 game tournament continues.<br/>
This is fun! We should do it more often.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 7: PalpyOps vs. Joel’s Profit M+T<br/>
I just finished playing his brother Mike in game 3, and it was fun. I<br/>
decide not to put Mara in the Aud Chamber. I set up quick, and he<br/>
battled against 5 of my power 4, defense 4 royal guards and lost over<br/>
and over again! I LOVE THE PREFECT’S OFFICE!!! He failed a Fallen Portal<br/>
draw against a single royal guard at one point. Like before, there was a<br/>
lot of battles on the ground, but neither of us took to space. He was<br/>
unfortunately killing all of my characters, leaving me with fewer and<br/>
fewer cards. DVDLOTS got lost cruising around DB 94, and I never<br/>
bothered to find him. The constant killing and Profit DD did me in. This<br/>
was another really fun game, and there was no way I could have won this<br/>
game by doing it differently. I even tried to abyssian ornament for 5<br/>
with just a couple cards left in the deck, but I drew Palpy! DRAT! This<br/>
was fun.<br/>
<br/>
FL by 11<br/>
6(+16)<br/>
<br/>
PROS: Another fantastic game. Putting the Prefect’s Office in the deck.<br/>
CONS: I should have killed Han earlier.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 8: EBO Capitals vs. Van’s ISB with ORS<br/>
Finally; and out-of-state player! This game was just ugly. I have never<br/>
played against an ISB deck, so I already knew that this could suck for<br/>
me. I don’t know how to play against it. On top of that, I got set up<br/>
too late. He set up his drains big and fast on me. I was draining for<br/>
10, but he cancelled the 4 @ Kiffex with the Den Of Theives. I couldn’t<br/>
find Strike Planning to stop him from cancelling drains, and he couldn’t<br/>
find a trample to get rid of my undercover spies. I took out Bossk and<br/>
Fett at the expense of the Spiral (it deploys as a react for 1 with EBO<br/>
in effect!), and he never tried space again. He won the drain race<br/>
because he beat me off the 4th marker, cancelling Menace Fades’ effect.<br/>
It was a fun game, he was a good guy, and I’m glad I finally got to play<br/>
against this deck type.<br/>
<br/>
FL by 5<br/>
6(+11)<br/>
<br/>
PROS: Finally playing an ISB deck.<br/>
CONS: Losing to an ISB deck.<br/>
<br/>
So I almost scrubbed out. I guess it was borderline. I came 32nd out of<br/>
56, so I was right there in the middle again. My prize support of 1 CC<br/>
and 2 DS2 packs along with a "grab pack" with Vaper Crall and DS2<br/>
commons (just what I needed) worked out great; I pulled a Jedi Luke!<br/>
That was worth the $15. Thanks a lot to AZG for hosting us on this late<br/>
event, Mike Girard, Brandon Allen, and Jay Webb for running an amazing<br/>
tournament, and everyone else that helped out for doing so. I wish I<br/>
could have recorded the top 10 scores, but I didn’t get them all. Brett<br/>
Kitani took 6th place overall. I stayed after for the final<br/>
confrontation, and after the dust settled, Kevin Shannon beat Brian Hunter to<br/>
take sole possession of 1st place and the entire BB StarWars set. They<br/>
agreed before the match to give 2nd place the set of Reflections and 1st<br/>
place everything else. I’m pretty sure that was the arrangement; we<br/>
couldn’t hear what they were saying over everyone talking! j/k. Thanks a<br/>
lot for a great time!<br/>
<br/>
The Good:<br/>
* Arizona Gamer for hosting the event<br/>
* Michael Girard (Gold 120) for running a HUGE yet flawless tournament<br/>
* Kevin Shannon for winning the thing<br/>
* Brett Kitani for placing 6th overall<br/>
* All the out of towners that made the trip, especially Clint Hays, Kevin Shannon, and Brian Hunter.<br/>
* Everyone who stayed at AZGamer from 8am til 9:30pm for the whole shbang.<br/>
<br/>
The Bad and The Ugly:<br/>
* Me for scrubbing hard<br/>
* P.H. for placing lower than me - When he said he was having a Steve day, he meant it!<br/>
* Mike Sinclair for constantly saying penis throughout the day ;-)<br/>
* The traffic on I-17 for making me late (8:45)<br/>
<br/>
