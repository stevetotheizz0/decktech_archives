<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Jonathan and Scott picked me up Saturday morning, it was very cold and the roads were icy. But the TL hit the road for Lexington right on time. Blah blah blah we got there a little late and started. <br/>
<br/>
My light deck for this tournament was Ketwol EBO, aka Deadbolt. Ive been tinkering with it for the past couple of weeks and have had tons of fun playing it. It has its weaknesses but once it is set up it puts a lock on the opponent, which is a blast. Dark this time around was a BHBM odds deck. Only 3 characters, 2 Emperors, 3 Tech Mors, and 4 Vaders (2 Lord and 2 LOTS). It has a decent fleet and insane destinies and activation. Emperors Power turns Vader into a one man wrecking crew and makes the bounty hunter ships devastating. I might add that it can win without the odds (see below).<br/>
<br/>
Okay lets get started.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - BYE<br/>
grr, just my luck. FW+0<br/>
<br/>
2(0)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - DS versus Lucas Roberts (1517)<br/>
<br/>
He was playing profit and he started Insurrection and some other non-Insight stuff. I started IOA, Mobilization Points, and Oppressive Enforcement. My first turn I pull Rendili and DSII Docking Bay and Emperor and the other 952 cards that Im able to get on my first turn. He activates and says, Go. I deploy Fett In Ship to rendili and grab the CC Docking bay. He activates and maybe draws and on my turn I deploy DLOTS with stick to the Mos Eisley he deployed earlier. He loses to Your Destiny while freeing Han with Ben and a scrub. Meanwhile Tech Mor has found his way to the DSII Docking Bay and an odds has slipped into Lucas reserve. I keep draining away at Rendili and Mos Eisley and he gives me Luke but by the time the first odds has popped and another one has been inserted and popped with his destiny totals being 10 less than mine both times Ive won. FW+20something<br/>
<br/>
4(+20something)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - LS versus Shannon Huecker (1593)<br/>
<br/>
He starts the Court stuff with Mobilization Points, Power Of The Hutt, and No Escape maybe. I start Battle Plan, Strike Planning, and Squadron Assignments. I get off to a slow start by not getting A New Secret Base necessary for my EBO setup until the 4ht or 5th turn. Luckily for me, he starts off slower. Eventually I get EBO out and the Ketwol engine working and I deploy Lando, Nien, and NeoFalcon to Endor (for two). I have a barrier, DTF, Frozen Assets, Capt Han, and Spiral in my hand so Im not too worried about anything really. Oh I also have Legendary Starfighter. Obi goes to the North Ridge to satisfy Shannon’s Search And Destroy but U-3P0 follows him. Zuckuss tries to front the Falcon but gets barriered, and then beat and Legendaried (is that a word?). Bossk falls to a similar fate. At one point I deploy EPP Luke and EPP Obi to battle a couple of his aliens at Jabbas Palace and halfway through the battle someone remembers the Obi on Hoth who was hiding behind U-3P0. So I take back the second Obi and <br/>
proceed to take out both his characters with Luke. Soon Colonel Cracken deploys up to Hoth for more drains. Between the drain of 6, the Legendary, and my retrieval of over 20 through On The Edge, Shannon succumbs. FW+20 or so<br/>
<br/>
6(+high 40s)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - DS versus Richie Law (1721)<br/>
<br/>
Richie starts Hidden Base with Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Insight (grr!). I start the same as game 2. I suspect a Hunter-style Hidden Mains and thats what it was. Since he started Insight, I figured that he had noticed my odds in the second game (considering he was sitting right next to me). An early Masterful Move finds no hologram so Richie gets to verify my deck. He smiles and remarks, Glad I didnt lose Insight. I had no idea you were playing odds. Darnit. Oh well. Then I draw up my Monnok and play it lost. Im astounded as I nab 2 Home Ones, 2 Jedi Lukes, and 2 On The Edges.  I get Vader set up at the CC Docking Bay and the Emperor at his throne room. EPP Luke joins his father and then his sister (Boushh) comes down to block the drain The Beast has. He deploys Ben and his saber to the Tatooine docking bay along with EPP Han. I move Vader over to block the drain and Boushh follows. His turn he breaks Bousshhs cover and battles. My action I exclude Obi with You Are Beaten and then I hit Boushh <br/>
and draw 2 destiny (god love Emperors Power). I beat him by a few but forget to make him stack. Somewhere early I grab both Fall Of The Legend and Throw Me Another Charge, which shut down his high destiny cycyling. Eventually the Vader drain and another early Rendili drain wear him down. FW+17 i think.<br/>
<br/>
I finish as the only undefeated at 8(+65) or so. Team Louisville finished 1, 2, 3 as Scott Koehler and Jonathan Wilkerson came in behind me. Congrats to the winner of the uncommon uncut sheet. Of course I pull junk in my prize support. <br/>
