<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay here is my report on the latest Tuesday Mirkwood touneament.  I went with a Mains n’ toys Twix sites with S/A for the LS and a Variation of court that I called missing on Tatooine (posted on decktech about 2 weeks ago)<br/>
<br/>
First game my DS vs. Scott Hammond<br/>
<br/>
Uh-Oh, Scott is someone who hasn’t played in a while, but I remember him to be a very good player, and this Dark side is just a goofy Idea I had and thought that could be cool.<br/>
Turn 1, my opening hand is great 4 characters, incl. Jabba and Mara, in a character light deck.  He was playing MWYHL.  I deployed Jabba to the AC, and drew up.  He takes the 1 force from court and deploys yoda to his hut.  Turn 2 I deploy Mara w/saber to my Judland Wastes, then draw up.  His turn he tries to deploy Leia w/gun to Jabbas site, and I point out that she costs +2 from no bargin (my 3 starting effects are no bargin, opressive enforcement, and there is no try), he says never mind then takes the 1 force from court, replaces my Judland Wastes with his, and sayas go,saving most of his force.  my turn I drain and draw.  his turn, he deploys Leia w/gun, Obi w/stick and 3 2/2 rebel pilots to take on Mara.  He attacks swings misses, shoots misses, I swing at Obi, hit.  he draws a 0 for BD, I draw a 5.  He loses obi, and one of the pilots, I lose about 5 from hand.  My turn Control phase disarm leia, then I deploy Dr. E and Bossk w/ gun.  Assisnate Leia, chop one of the pilots Assinate him, then I took a shot with Bossk (missed thank god) and played Jabbas through with you.  Drew 2 destinys (4 and 0) and he lsot the pilot plus about 7 force.  From then on he just lost force, I don’t remember much of the rest of the game, he came down once more after I had Scum out, and died again, I won with one card in my lost pile.<br/>
FW +37<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs. Graham Neal’s Set your corse for Scum.<br/>
I knew this would be a tough game because Graham loves Scum and My LS doesn’t handle it asa well as I’d like (the reason that I’m building a new LS before next week).  This game was kinda a blur, there was a lot of battles, where a lot of people died, and he had more characters than me.  <br/>
FL -13 now 2(+24)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs. Adam (I forgot his last name) and his MKOAbyssians.<br/>
<br/>
Okay first off I hate MKOS decks it is just a bring back the old horde decks, that were strong top begin with, and make then a little stronger, This game was also filled with battles, but my S/A took it’s toll on him (he didn’t keep Scum out for more than 1 turn until the very end.) and My characters killed a lot of his, but they just kept coming back.  In the end he has more fodder to throw at me, than I do at him.  <br/>
FL -5 now 2(+19)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs. Josh Grace???  What Josh is a good player I have been sucking monkey nipple, what up.<br/>
Well we had played on Friday, and he knew what my DS was meant to do, so I was very worried.  he starts MWYHL and goes through test 2, with DoS.  So at least I know that Leia w/gun won’t be coming down.  But everyone else does, I had gotten another good opening hand, and I had the cards to keep him from killing all my guys, (thank god for Projective Telepathy) The kicker was when Obi w/Saber, Twass Kah and Jedi Luke with saber came down against Fett w/gun Dr. E and Boelo, Projective telepathy.   My turn, Disarm and assinate Jedi Luke, battle retrieve 3, play Hidden Weapons on Obi, draw a 4 assinate him, shoot at Twass, miss, play Jabbas through with you, cancel his draw and draw like 3,1 he loses twass and some force, but never really confronted me on Tatooine Large scale again, I went into space with Dengar and Zuckuss, and shouldn’t have, I got spanked there, but my Tatooine stuff was too much for him to handle, Full win by 17<br/>
finished 4 (+46)<br/>
After this game we played a fun game against my new royal Guards on Raltiir, and I should have won, but forgot that he couldn’t drain at Rendilli after my objective flipped.  Well that why I didn’t play that deck in the tourney I don’t know it well enough yet.  So I lost by 2.<br/>
