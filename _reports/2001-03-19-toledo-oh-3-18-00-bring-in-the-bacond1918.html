well it’s Saturday at 2 in the afternoon and I go to the store to get ready for my deck clinic i’m having for the new guys.  No one shows up. I sit there and wait, but no one.  Shey comes in finally and we trade.  He tells me he wants to play a deck with General Solo and guys with immunity, so I show him Strike Planning and Insertion Planning and hes happy. So he goes and I wait some more.  There is a Raw Deal tourney but I decide that my starter deck and 2 booster packs isn’t enough to hold up to guys with a bunch of ultra rare foil chyna cards.  So guess what I do? i wait.  Edwin shows up later and thats cool.  We play a 4 way raw deal match and my commons pile takes down everyone.  So then comes in Slutzy wearing shorts even though its 30 degrees out and snowing.  that kid is crazy.  then Pubes, Cramer and Paul show up about 7 so we play and trade and stuff. I whip on Pubes’ EBOX with my ROP/Bikers.  I also pull a game out of my @#$% with my WYS Lewis style vs Pubes’ SYCFA manip (he Mioomed both owne and beru and monnoked my harvests and houjix’s) by setting up 1 guy at 3 sites and doing celebration.  I don’t playtest my actual decks because I know everything about them.  We then go to pauls to "playtest", but end up just playing Babylon 5.  So i’m like lets go to Toledo tomorrow, and everyones like ok.  so sunday morning we are making arrangements.  Paul can’t go so its me and Cramer with Pubes behind the wheel. We look for a Dennys to eat at but have to settle for Wendy’s. Team BBQ BACON arrives at the game roo around 11:30.  The tourney was delayed and a Raw Deal was going on, so I played in it and got raped, but afterwards brett and andrew gave me cards so thanx guys. Anyway not many people are there.  Brad Chester, the top player in NW ohio, is nowhere to be found.  So we have 8 though and we play.<br/>
<br/>
tourney goals: go atleast 3-1. get a foil somehow.<br/>
<br/>
decks:same from bashcon.<br/>
HBX and EOPS/RUMORS<br/>
<br/>
games.<br/>
1. Ls vs Dennis Brown (1541) HDADTJ/DUEL<br/>
Yay I get to play hd first game.  I should be nervous.  but im not.  Cause HBX is advantaged vs hd if you play it right.  And I played it right.  Early on I get honor and he cant find vader, so visage hurts him some. his battle order slows me a bit. He loses a card off the top early and its........CC DB!!! that is awesome for me since he cant do search and destroy now.  Also he lost his sniper to a drain then I put a UC spy..hehe.  So I setup drains in space, and he drains at the executor.  He is losing the race so he probes and he’s right. So now I can’t cancel his executor drain. But then I remember something, and he drains, I tell him to place his obj out of play, so he decides he wont drain.  He’s content to let visage eat me.  So I all wings for 11, spread out, and he’s finished. <br/>
FW 2 (+26)<br/>
<br/>
well i’m in like 3rd behind cramer and pubes, but we were all ls.<br/>
<br/>
2. DS vs rob Jones’(1482) HB/bwings/guns<br/>
He starts the forfiet weapons effect, and i’m scared cause big blue is useless if it gets shot down.  I setup ephant man at the bunker and a few guys at the endor db, and deploy rumors.  we fight alot in space.  I can’t seem to hurt him, and he is flipped.  I try a spread and probe/drain thing, and the last system I probe is his base.<br/>
I put homing beacon on a lone bwing and that basically nullifys his drain at that system.  I’m lucky cause he keeps missing the shots on most of my ships.  there were some casualties though, like the DSStardestroyer, virago, and something else.  once he’s probed he’s finished cause I chase him around and he can’t drain.  We do a few final fights where I beat him down.  He decides to go down fighting and does a suicide battle and loses, that’s game.<br/>
FW 4 (+40)<br/>
<br/>
Still in 3rd......<br/>
<br/>
3. Ls vs Andrew Brown (1624) Mkos/abyssin/mains.<br/>
Well as i sit down andrew tells me he wants into BBQ BACON so i tell him we’ll see (hey andrew-you’re in now).  He does the MKOS thing and thinks i got hidden mains...untill i drop 4 xwings turn 1.  I setup my small drains in space and he cancels a few.  He can’t find gay-lid and when he does 2 of his sites are blanketed by uc spys.  I cancel his drains on tat where he doesnt have 2 aliens.  He does search and destroy so i take some loss.  He brings zuckass to probe and i barrier. he loads it with forfiet, but he still gets raped.  lando in falcon becomes a legendary starfighter thanks to that battle.  he loses a bunch, one of which was secret plans. that was cool.  so i do my all wings and get back 13 which helped.  i setup the forest tech at yavin and search and destroy doesnt hurt.  last turn he moves a guy to the desert heart, but i drain him out (then show him the uc py i was gona drop at the desert).<br/>
FW 6 (+59)<br/>
<br/>
i’m in second cause pubes beat cramer...<br/>
<br/>
4. DS vs Adam "Pubes" Huber (1544) EBOX<br/>
we start and know each others decks almost card for card.  he does ebo while i setup rumors and drain at the endor db.  i try to fight early and i get raped by xwings.  so i’m taking alot of drains and i’m hurting.  i consolidate my forces and go after him again.  i keep killing his ships, which is key since he cant do all wings now.  he drops jedi luke to hoth and does manace fades. WTF? menace fades in a EBOX deck? thats pubes for ya.  I respond with decree (stopping ebo and lukes stik).  we chase each other in space more and fight.  he attacks my but doesnt do orgy attack so his xwings die.  we just chase each other, and drain.  he runs out of stuff first, so i win. <br/>
FW 8 (+62)<br/>
