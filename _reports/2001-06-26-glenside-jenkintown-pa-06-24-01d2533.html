<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">As a preamble, sorry about any typos, its getting late as I write this. Also, I didn’t take any notes (never do) so don’t complain about lack of detail too much.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-tourney (not much this time):<br/>
It’s been two weeks since my last tourney (Ramapo), and I’m anxious to try my new decks: Lingrell’s Broken LS Deck (on DeckTech) and my own crappy YMSYL that can only win if I get a good start.<br/>
We (me and my scrub-friends) leave for Jared Napolitano’s (woo-hoo! spelled it right on the first try!) house and get there late, thanks to MapQuest. We leave for Glenside and Jared takes over as our new official MapQuest. We get there and notice an abundance of players standing around outside. We get there just in time to find out that the store owner didn’t open up the store, so everybody’s heading out to Brave New Worlds in Jenkintown. We pile up in Bob’s SUV, and head out, and break only a few traffic laws to get to our destination. We get there and start the tourney shortly thereafter. My rating is 1683 going in.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
LS vs. Ted Pansyszyzn (1772) Mains w/Drain locations<br/>
This game was very different from the ones that I’m used to playing with this deck. I lost the race. In two weeks of playtesting, this has only happened once. That meant that when I blew the Bunker next turn, it was only a 4 card swing rather than a 28 card swing. This lead to the next problem. Because Ted only lost 2 force out of the podrace and the Bunker combined, he had enough cards to get his hand back, drop mains, Elis a few, and take control of the Rebel Landing Site. We had huge battles, with him prevailing at first, but I eventually regained control thanks to a well timed Too Close For Comfort. I eventually beat him off Endor, then drain for the win.<br/>
FW +8<br/>
2(+8)<br/>
Highlights: Starting with a win, playing a very interactive game.<br/>
Lowlights: Losing the race, getting low dif with this deck, it usually gets in the 30s.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
DS vs. Ryan Lynch (1522) Avatar’s QMC<br/>
I hate playing friends in tourneys. Now, I not only have to play a friend, but I’m DS which means auto-loss. My opening hand blows, no walkers and I have the 3rd Marker, so I can’t pull a Garrison. Pull the Hoth: DB, draw and get Piett, which is good, because I can get Merrejk and Hoth next turn. Alas, I don’t draw any walkers. His turn, he gets a site and draws. My turn, drop Piett to the DB, pull Merrejk and check for Hoth, but it’s not there. Drop Piett and Merrejk to the DB and draw. His turn, he frops EPP Obi and EPP Luke, battle, chop Merrejk and Mess him, chop Piett, I lose like 10 or so and that sets the tone for the game. I don’t find any walkers for a while and I do nothing while he sets up the lock. I eventually muster a small ground force that runs amok on Hoth pinging him, but he gets out CC Celebration. My turn, cancel with Endor Occ, and drain + direct damage to bury it. His drains become too much, and I die soon before maximizing the full potential of my deck.<br/>
FL -14<br/>
2(-6)<br/>
Highlights: My theory proves right once again; Light always wins<br/>
Lowlights: Why am I always right?<br/>
<br/>
That really sucked. Ryan is a good player, but, like me, he’s just starting to play tournaments so his rating is crap. He should be a lot higher, so I unjustly lose some rating points.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
LS vs. Jared Napolitano (1852) YMSYL<br/>
I have a good feeling about this game, I’ve always wanted to get Jared back for smacking me around with his Hunt Down, and now he gets to face the Broken LS Deck. Life is good (besides all Game 2’s from every turnament).  He gets drain of 3 at the DP with a PotF and 1 Direct Damage from YMSYL going fast.  Too bad I got a good hand.<br/>
I blow up Bunker, but win race the turn after he gets his hand back, so he know’s what he’s losing. But no matter, his life force is dwindling thanks to my drains of 2 and 3 at the RLS and Back Door respectively.<br/>
In desperation, he drops Ozzel and Mara to the Hoth DB along with Decree. I smile, activate up to my 5, drop Cracken and EPP Luke. Double Agent and kill Mara, swing with at Ozzel and hit him with a tracked 5 and a blind 5, draw a blind 6 for destiny. Craziness. Ozzel and the game.<br/>
FW +30<br/>
4(+24)<br/>
Highlights: A few days ago, Jared said that his biggest lost ever was to Praskac by 30. I guess I’m as good as Praskac :-)<br/>
Lowlights: Not winning the race when he was without a hand.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
DS vs. Andy Talaga (1900) Hidden Mains<br/>
When I see SquAss, I start Decree for fear of matching pilots and big drains. Stupid me. He starts getting planets and force-choking me, giving me only 1 force from RP, Endor, Aquaris, and Alderaan. Problem number 2 is that I don’t find any walkers until turn 4 or 5. After beating down on Mara for 9 cards with Qui-Ghonorea and Luke, he loads up on mains at the Hoth DB and I lose a lot of characters trying to clear him, so I decide to move away and give him the drain. I go to space near the end of the game with Thrawn on the Chimaera at Hoth with a PotF, but he Alters it and there go my hopes. I get some drains and DD going, but it’s too little too late and I die.<br/>
Highlights: None<br/>
Lowlights: Making it close?<br/>
FL -10<br/>
4(+14)<br/>
<br/>
After game 4, TD Ted P (don’t wanna screw up the last name, ya know?) says that the store is closing in an hour and we have two options:<br/>
End the tourney after 4 games, or play two 30 minute games. Guess what the overwhelming response is?<br/>
<br/>
30 Minute games:<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
LS vs. Bob Caton (1704) TDIGWATT<br/>
Bob knows he won’t win the race after I draw my destiny and he doesn’t stack any race destinies throughout the game. On his second turn, he drops Lord Vader to the RLS and kills General Han, but I manage to OOC Vader (he’s only playing 1, but c’mon, I OOC’d Vader!) He’s playing speed Dark Deal, but it doesn’t seem too speedy to me, but he does manage to get it out the turn that I win the race. I blow up the Bunker after winning the race, which means he gets no hand and has to lose 14 cards. After getting his DD set up, he has a Stormtrooper and a Weequay at some CC site. I drop EPP Luke, battle, chop the Weequay and clear the site, but we tie in power from all of his adders. I get I Did It! set up for small retrieval. At the end of the game, he has 5 or so cards to my 30+ with 1 card in lost pile. He has a lone Stormtrooper standing off against Corran Horn and EPP Luke. He tries to go out in a blaze of glory. Initiate, Trooper Assault. I choose not to swing. He keeps trying to get me to swing, but I won’t have it. Time for my battle destiny, I choose not to draw. He says, "Come on, I want you to draw." I don’t draw. We tie in power (wtf? a lone Trooper holds off Corran Horn and Luke?) And it’s my turn. I use I Did It! to get back my last card in lost pile and drain him out.<br/>
FW +37<br/>
6(+51)<br/>
Highlights: Good dif, OOC Vader<br/>
Lowlights: None<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
DS vs. Bill Kafer (1497) Tatooine Mains<br/>
Geez, I have to play another friend. Oh well, I have a God-hand. Two turns to set up, then two consecutive Walker Garrisons plus amazing Direct Damage kill Bill dead. I win in like 4 or 5 turns.<br/>
FW +26<br/>
8(+77)<br/>
Highlights: Finally my deck worked like it was supposed to<br/>
Lowlights: playing a friend<br/>
<br/>
Top three (If you want the differentials or all of the standings, read Ted’s TR):<br/>
1. Andy Talaga<br/>
2. Greg Shaw<br/>
3. Jared Napolitano<br/>
<br/>
So I take second and get Snowspeeder Foil, a bonus pack of Tat for getting +77 dif, pull crap and an AI Obi. Now for the Props/Slops (not that many this time):<br/>
