<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Here is the Mirkwood TR from Tuesday night.  I was playing BHBM with lots of characters and Imperial commands for dark (the deck that I felt could most stand up to WYS) and a goofy TIGIHis speeders and x-wings for light.  BHBM I won’t post since there is already about 9000 of them on this site, and lite I won’t post since it really would just waste everyones time to read it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my LLS vs. Herb and his HDADTJ.<br/>
<br/>
Okay I have said a few not so nice things about Herb in the past but over the last few weeks he has gotten much less objectionable to play.  Not fun mind you, I just hate him less now than I ever did.  This game was quick and painful.  I Twi’leked for Honor, and found out it wasn’t in my deck.  Herb flipped on the 2nd turn with Vader Tarkin Mara at the Endor landing site, and the only other site deployed was the Hoth DB.  We had a few battles, but Visage killed me quick.  FL by 33.<br/>
<br/>
highs.  It was quick<br/>
lows: where to begin???? the entire game.  This one loss almost made me not post this TR<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My DS. vs. Louie and his I don’t know.<br/>
<br/>
Okay I think he was playing New age Throne room with DB’s and mains and SA, but he never really did anything.  I play this BHBM without SA since it allows for more characters, and he burned at least 12 cards SAing my stuff which just went to my used pile.  I got early Janus and Palpy at the Endor DB, the battles were very few.  Vader and Tarkin Took on Obi and Mirax once. (maybe twice.) and Mara and Xixor paid a visit to the Home 1 db to see their pal wedge.  Mara got in the way of the door but xixor  (thanks to a tracked 5) taught Wedge the power of the black sun.  at this point I had 3 cards stacked, but he had given me JKLuke so I just took him over and started dueling to try and make him lose 3.  Late game he sent Twass Kah to take on Ephant Mon and Janus.  Lost the battle, and the game since that gave me the last card I needed to stack, and I turned Luke.<br/>
<br/>
FW +22, now 2(-11)<br/>
Highs:  Turning Luke this deck is solid<br/>
Lows:  Um.. Mara got in the way of as door. He sensed my Circle, so I played No escape to get it back, then he sensed it again.  cost him 6 force, and as I write this I couldn’t do that, since it should have gone to my used pile.<br/>
Game 3 my speeder crap vs. Rich j. Court<br/>
<br/>
Okay opening hand I got boussh.  so I never took damage from court.  I just spread out with my speeders and X-wings and out drained him.  NO BATTLES.  a late all wings for 8 helped up differential  FW by 15  now 4(+4)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Rich is a fun opponent and this was a close game<br/>
lows: this is the first game I’ve had in a long time with no battles.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 my DS vs. Jerome Flynn and his HBSQUASS.<br/>
<br/>
This game was never close.  I used Mob. POints to puill exec. one turn 3 had Empy Janus SIm at endor DB, and just activated force so when he moved to a battleground I could jump him with Zuckass, Thrawn and Pellanon on Chimera and Lateral Damage.  I did, cost him about 10 force plus Hobbie in his ship.  Jerry just drew up after that since I had the Exec. in my hand, and played no escape to get back the LD that he cancelled.  We knew it would be game.<br/>
FW by 25 6(+29)<br/>
Highs:  one big battle, this deck works<br/>
lows: Jerry got spanked, and it wasn’t a nice way to beat a good player and a nice guy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so I finished about 5th at 3-1 and had some fun games<br/>
<br/>
