<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">   Sorry if I am missing information. I wasn't planning on writing a tourney report but seeing as there wasn't one for our region I thought I would throw one up.<br/>
   I have been playing star wars for just over a year now. Started with a booster draft of Endor, then played in another booster draft which gave me a spot at last years regionals. Decided since I qualified for regionals maybe I should take up the game.  My skill has grown a fair bit over the last year, I won the last three tournaments in Calgary leading up to the regionals, unfortanetely none of the were post-Death Star 2.<br/>
<br/>
My Decks:<br/>
Dark side:<br/>
The meta game was showing that hunt down was dead.  Honour Of The Jedi was a powerful card and not only did it hurt huntdown but it hurt there is no try.  I felt that a deck type that would be popular for the light side deck was a profit SAC deck.  The lack of people being prepared for hunt down other than HOTJ and the need for good SAC control made me feel that Hunt Down would be a good choice. I was playing with Docking Bays using Imperial Arrest Order and Mobolization Points. Decided to concentrate on ground my only space was the original Executor and Boba Fett in Slave 1 to go with Security Precautions against Hidden Base. Deck had minor dueling cards and about 18 characters and the rest destiny 5 and 6 helper cards.<br/>
<br/>
Light Side:<br/>
Felt Like trying out the new objective for light side. Just used it for its massive 6-1 activation to fuel a mains and Eloms beats deck. The deck was completely reactive. Plays where ever your opponent goes and relies on a buch of 2-0 sites for extra force.HOTJ stops there drains at my sites.  In about 8 games vs RalOps, they managed to flip once against me and that lasted for only a turn.<br/>
<br/>
On to the Tourney:<br/>
Game 1: my lightside vs ? SFS deck<br/>
We deploy are starting stuff and my opponent thinks this will be a boring non-interactive game, him space me ground.<br/>
He just drops some systems and draws the first couple of turns, I move Luke to DB and drain and drop a couple of Twix sites. Third turn he drops SFS, I respond with a lost Grimtaash. There goes 4 Tie interceptors and 2 all power to weapons. My next turn Lt Blout in Tala 2 come down to walkemuei backed up by Home One. We have several battles in space, he manages to lock down Fondor with executor and some other ships while I have control of wakulmuei and Kuat as well as EPP Han and Liea in control of a Db on Fondor. My drains end it fast. Win by 18.<br/>
2(+18)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My Hunt Down vs Lloyd Howe's CC mains deck.<br/>
My opponents deck didn't use the objective, it was just a ground drain deck with lots of force retrival and the use of the weather vane to keep his characters fron dying. Unfortanetely my opponent got completely screwed this game.<br/>
He just could draw his characters, every time he had to lose force he lost a couple cards from hand and then a character of the top. He actually dropped 2-1B just to try and off the edge some characters back. Game ended quick. Win by 26.<br/>
4(+44)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My Hunt Down vs Justin ?'s Profit<br/>
I set up quick but he kept coming at me with single Obis and Lukes and used destiny adders to keep killing my characters. I had wiped out a lot of his characters so I tried to spread a bit to meet requirements of HOTJ. unfortanelely still more Lukes and Bens came. I spread a bit too thin a couple of times and got smacked for about 7-10 force loss each time. He had Master Luke go up against Lord Vader with stick and manages to take out my last Vader with an untracked 6 for destiny which he said he only had 2-3 of in his deck. in the end he manages to free Han retrieve his 10 force and I die to Visage. Loss by 20.<br/>
4(+24)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: There Is Still Good In Him vs Darren ?'s Skirling Court deck.<br/>
We played this match up once before and I found out that his deck is specifically strong against mine. I had added Grimtaash just because of him.  He has no Imperials in his deck so Luke ran to Tatooine to get in on the action. Big story of this game is I never got a single location.  kept drawing them for destiny though.  I had good control early but drains were fairly even thanks to his Den of Thieves. I decided I should try to expand a bit. He had 6 Power at one site so I dropped Boushha and Orrimaarko and battled he drew a 6 for destiny I drew a 2 so he won the battle I forfieted Boushh and then I realized I forgot to leave force to run to back up. He retaliated with a group of Skirlings and there goes Orri and 10. He had scum going and I couldn't avoid his battles well enough, He overpowered Luke wiped out another site in in the end just drained me out. Loss by 10.<br/>
4(+14)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:Hunt Down vs ? starting Yoda's Hut.<br/>
wasn't sure what to take for my third starting effect against this guy so I thought I would just use You Cannot Hide Forever and pull something later once I found out what he had.  This game just involved lots of battles against lots of Jedi Lukes and other random characters. One turn he had Jedi Luke and Ben Kenobi sitting across from Igar in tempest 1. I deployed Iggy with gun he barriered knowing I had a tracked 6 on top. I battled any way. I drew a 6 and a 5 for destiny, cleared the site and only had to lose Igar. About two thirds of the way through the game he says "I guess your not planning on pitching You Cannot Hide Forever any time soon" and starts pitching numbers to my drains. :)<br/>
Win by 14.<br/>
6(+28)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Light vs ? Endor Ops That Things Operational deck.<br/>
I knew I had no chance of winning the game so I didn't try hard this game. Again luck was against me and I wasn't getting any locations for the first 4 or 5 turns. He grabbed Luke second turn with Vader and ran him to the Death Star 2 DB with Moff Jerjerrod so I couldn't easily get at him. He controlled space with his various matching pilots in ships combined with ZiMH and Dreadnaughts. I sent Colonel Cracken in Tala 1 in to blow the Second Death star which was operational second turn. Missed my first 2 tries at it and he managed to get Mianda in Sythe 1 to blow away my ship the turn before I would have had a tracked 7 to blow away the Death Star. I got force choked. and just could do much this game. I had 1 good battle where Home One led by tycho in red 6 hit a group at the Death Star 2. but he had the tie bomber pilot there that soaks up all the battle damage and attrition so nothing really came out of it. In the end Loss by 20.<br/>
6(+8)<br/>
<br/>
Didn't watch much of the final confrontation but the first match involved a Set Your Course SFS deck vs DBO deck!?! The DBO deck flipped fast with a correlian operative? EPP Han and a Rebel Trooper Recruit? backed up by a hemnthe at Han's location.  3rd or 4th turn a X-wing squadron was deployed with a x-wing laser cannon and moved to the death star. it was met by a lateral damage, a dreadnaught and 3 Tie Interceptors. The Interceptors got all powered, 1 got shot down and the result were power 7 Ties and a power 24 to 0 thanks to a zero battle destiny. The game ended quickly with a win of close to 30 for the dark side.  Reveresed sides involved a profit Deck vs another SFS deck. but there was no way to cover the huge loss of differential the first game.<br/>
<br/>
Props: Thanks to Ian and The Sentry Box for running the Regional.<br/>
Slops: to whoever started my downfall by mismatching me in the third round with a person who should have been much lower due to a timed win that he was credited a full win for.<br/>
Thanks For Your Time, Brent Holmstrom. </font></td>
