<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">*Pre Tourney stuff*<br/>
<br/>
About the 1st week of January, me and my Best friend Alex (who will be referred to as<br/>
Chazz from now on) decided we were gonna go to the tourney on the 21st. So the question<br/>
was, what to Play? We playtested a couple times and Chazz built a cool anti-MKOS profit,<br/>
which promptly lost to my MKOS, then beating it in the 2nd game, however, it was a bit<br/>
too dependant on a certain combo which we came up with, so he decided against that.<br/>
Chazz has a record of playing MWYHL in every tourney he’s been to, so we were thinking <br/>
about a test 6 for him,either that or WYS.<br/>
To make things a bit more difficult, reflections2 was put back a week and a half in the UK,<br/>
so we were either gonna get our r2 the day b4 the tourney, or not at all, so WYS was out.<br/>
I had been playing my Hunt Down since august, and although it was very solid against almost everything,<br/>
in the words of the late,great Owen Hart "Enough in enough, its time for a change!"<br/>
I remember back in April 2000, i took an Abyssin deck with a jp/ETE start which kicked on the day<br/>
and surprised everyone, so not having played it yet, i settled on MKOS Abyssin Swarm.<br/>
For LS, i had a HB Mains with On/Off The Edges/cyclable 6’s which i was really happy with, but neglected <br/>
to include a certain card which wouldve saved my @#$% in a game (more on that later).<br/>
Chazz ends up with a test 6 which i built, and my Hunt Down deck ^_^. We both get our boxes of r2 the day before<br/>
the tourney, i got a pretty good box but no URF, and i still needed 3 EU and 4 combos, while Chazz pulls <br/>
2 FETT BOX TOPPERS AND THE JAP VADER CASE TOPPER IN PACKETS!!!!! Plus a complete set of eu and combos (I SO PICKED<br/>
THE WRONG BOX).<br/>
<br/>
*End pre tourney stuff*<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, Chazz gets dropped at my house at 10, with the tourney due to start at 11, so my mum gives us a lift there.<br/>
None of the SW Players have arrived, with the exception of Scott Latham who I proceed to trade with. My Jedi Luke, Home 1 foil<br/>
and 3 or 4 crappy rares for a Jedi Luke foil, I am well pleased with that. Found a Wb Han in the common bin, along with an On<br/>
The Edge, by both for 10p (20 cents). Then trade that Han and a CC Fett for 4 packs of r1, and get Ben K foil, Visage foil, and <br/>
28 CC rares including LS Lando, Captain Han, and the good stuff like dark deal, courage etc.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually players trickle in, and we Start at 11:45, with 15 players, Dave Harding the Director not playing as he is here to sell<br/>
his cards, have stopped playing, but will continue to direct.<br/>
<br/>
My Decks: My Abyssin has more eyes than yours (MKOS Swarm) and The Color of Beats (HB Mains)<br/>
CHazz’s Decks: training The Chazz Way (MWYHL test 6) and Ayatolla 2k1 (my high destiny HD Dueler)<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: MKOS VS Peter Ashworth’s (1578) Profit<br/>
<br/>
i was very pleased when i saw that. I start Well Guarded, TINT/Oppressive, No Bargain and POTH with <br/>
Mighty Jabba and Chall in the chamber, he starts DODN/WA and Insurrection. My First turn, drop Ephant to AC and Scum and Draw.<br/>
HE draws for a few turns. 3rd turn i deploy the lower passage with Boelo, Bib and an Abyssin, while Mosep, Galid and Myo went <br/>
to the AC for about 7 force for the lot. I get to verify his deck, abd see a weird mix of Mositure Farmers/Eloms/Vaporators/Baragwins/<br/>
High Destiny, so im a bit confused, but not worried as there doesnt appear to be anything that can outpower abyssins. He sends Lando with<br/>
Axe and a Baragwin to the Lower Passage, He fails to exclude boelo and he loses the farmer, me the abyssin. My turn i put down guri and battle,<br/>
but he excluded Boelo again, so i dont get destiny, but he draws a 0. He loses 4 to the power difference. He reinforces with a Moisture farmer <br/>
and a Baragwin, Battles and Gets rid of bib, but i draw a 5 so Lando is alone again. I decide to flip and deploy Dengar with a few abyssins at JP.<br/>
Lando somehow remains alive,killing every1 except guri and boelo ran to ac, but im not worried as i can retrieve what little force is in my lost pile. He deploys tatooine<br/>
and battle plan, so Zuckuss and Bossk go there for a drain of 2 which would stay all game. I start to get in drains of 3 off the top, and deploy secret plans<br/>
, so he has to do something. He deploys epp luke into the ac, epp leia (none shall pass), and a couple of elmos. He decides to run to the lower passage, <br/>
rather than get beatdown. Another drain of 5, and his turn he deploys a baragwin, and a moisture farmer, and leia again, and moves luke and elmos in.<br/>
my go, drop 3 abyssins, iggy with,4lom with, 1st strike, battle, cancel luke, he shoots boelo with leia, i cancel his destiny, and he has to lose all but luke and an elmo.<br/>
his go he runs outside to jp, where dengar and friends kill luke and his buddy. I drain him out shortly after.<br/>
<br/>
FW +25<br/>
Props: Everything pretty much, MKOS doing what it should.<br/>
Slops: Nothing<br/>
<br/>
Chazz wibs his 1st game also, beating Nigel Lincoln by 15, woulda been more but he over beatdown near the end, and never got his hand back.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: The Color of Beats vs Pete "I Won Worlds Day 1" Di Biasio’s (1847) MKOS<br/>
<br/>
Oh C.rap! I Always win big 1st game, so i nearly always get pete 2nd game. I start Staging Areas, Insurrection and Battle Plan instead of Insight.<br/>
i know if i am to have any chance, i gotta get down early, and make him keep battling me. His start is incredible, deploys Chall, uses the Ac to deploy Mighty Jabba, <br/>
and uses chall to get an abys. I get out dagobah, yodas hut, and h1 db draw a couple 1st turn. his 2nd turn, puts down someone, Bib and an abyssin, and flips, and uses lower passage to get them there.<br/>
my 2nd turn, activate a buttload, tunnel vision for lando with, and put him and ben with saber down at jp. Boelo and 3 abyssins come to them, but 2 abyssins have a portal fall on their heads. i miss <br/>
excluding boelo, but the abyssin is sliced, so he has a fair bit of damage. my go, i drain for 3, tunnel vision for a jedi luke, put him down with saber at cc db and draw. 4lom with, fett with and more <br/>
abyssins come to JP, but a portal falls on 4lom and a abyssin again, pete gets pissed. An Abyssin gets excluded, and fett is chopped. Again more damage while my boys stayed alive. Pete then finds scum and<br/>
1st strike plus galid, so its his drain of 5, 4 off top  vs my 5. He grabs on and off the edge, limiting my retrieval to 20. Luke dies after a swarm of 1 eyes hits him,<br/>
while a retrieved 4lom, in combination with iggy and some abyssins capture lando and kill ben. I am virtually dead, so epp han and tawss on a suicide to the ac finishes it.<br/>
<br/>
Fl -31<br/>
total: 2-6<br/>
Props: the good start<br/>
Slops: The rest of the game<br/>
<br/>
Chazz is playing his MWYHL have learned vs Neil Goodacres MKOS. Chazz is within 8 cards of dying, but he flips and retrieve 10 with objective, stacks test 6 on test 5(lol), and retreives<br/>
10 more with on the edge. Neil grabs it at the 3rd time of asking, but now every attack Chazz makes clears his sites. They time out with chazz having 3 more. Putting him on 3 +28<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: MKOS vs Mat Allen (1791) local Uprising on Tatooine<br/>
<br/>
This caught me off guard. He started same as i did with my LS last game. I pretended not to have any space in my Ds, he actually believed it. He pulls H1 db 1st turn, deploy Squassin<br/>
and draws. I just draw, apart from deploying blast door controls and getting the ac with JP. he deploys Dash and the Outrider with Squassin to tatooine, plus a SP DB and tat db from hand, so i am getting a buttload of force.<br/>
I have Fett in slave 1 and zuckuss in mist hunter in hand, but dont feel quite ready to take him on, so i count my force, drop ephant and mighty jabba to ac, and draw 2 cards, Scum and villany and 4lom with (sweet).<br/>
His turn he deploys Ben K with stick and r2 chewie at sp db, ill take the leader, and an effect which i forget (didnt do anything to me). my go, slap down 4lom with in zuckuss in mh, and fett in slave 1. Matt alters scum b4 <br/>
i battle, which was probably key looking back on this. I deployed bib and an abyssin to flip the objective b4 i battle, and 1st strike aswell. Dash +Ship and about 10 was the result, the fact i drew 12 for BD helped.<br/>
It is now him who has 2 pay to drain for about 5 a turn, while i geta drain of 4 free. I deploy mosep and galid to increase the pressure, in response he deploys lando with axe and tawss at jp, but forgets to save a force. Iggy, <br/>
Chall and 2 abyssins go there, but scum stays on table for about 5 seconds as its altered again. I battle, capture lando and lay the hurt on tawss for about 5 overflow. the Independence with Han and a shuttled up chewie goes to <br/>
tatooine allowing him to get out tat celebration. I battle him in space, han and chewie die, but my side is cleared, so i have 2 pay 2 drain again. it gets down to this, i have a drain of 6 off the top which i have 2 pay for, he has a drain of 7<br/>
for free. I drain him down to 3 cards, his turn he drains me so i have 8 cards, so i cant afford to drain him, and he retrieved 2 with celebration. So he won by 1. But after the game, we find 2 of my cards under his bag, a Myo and an abyssin, so <br/>
i was 2cards short the whole F****** game!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Fl -1<br/>
2 -7<br/>
Highs: running it so close<br/>
Lows: I shouldve won, i woulda done if those cards were in my deck<br/>
<br/>
I wander over to see Chazz’s HD playing Leonard Smith’s MWYHL mains. I arrived about 2 seconds after Scout Luke joined the DS. Obi goes OOP 2 turns later, and chazz wins by 18, currently at 3-0 which proves his current rating of 1412 is <br/>
utter b0llocks<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:<br/>
HB Mains VS Mat Allen’s SYFCA Big Blue Chireaneau Deck<br/>
<br/>
Mat Again, wonderful. I again Start Battle Plan instead of YISYW. Remember i said about neglecting to put a certain card in, well it was Menace fades, and it wouldve won me this game.<br/>
matt gets a really fast start, imperial commanding for piett, he and merrejk go to the executor db 1st turn, also pulls kashyyyk.<br/>
i pull tat db, dagobah and yodas hut and draw. 2nd turn he grabs fondor, deploys flagship exe for 7, deploys GAT, and moves peitt and merrejk to <br/>
the bridge. Ouch! I get out a couple more db’s and jedi luke goes to h1 db for activation. The Chimaera with ozzel and Chiraneau comes to endor, and <br/>
he has a drain of 6 set up, plus he drops something special planned, oh joy! set up Ben Kenobi with Saber at tat db, Lando with gun and mirrax, and ben goes to the death star, while luke <br/>
moves to tatooine. DLOTS Comes to see his son, but we tie in power. Vader manages to kill luke when i attack him next turn, but the 6 for my destiny ensures hes still paying to drain.<br/>
He is just ahead at this point, and deploys mara and palpatine to coruscant db, plus imperial decree which he now satisfies. I use my Meganormous Force Pile to deploy another Luke, <br/>
orrimaarko and transit them there while deploying home 1 with epp leia at fondor. Order to engage was deployed a couple of turns ago, so he battles, and is down by 4 so mara dies plus the 2 force<br/>
from orri, who also dies. I @#$% up tracking a 6 for an on the edge, promptly killing Obi, but i have another in hand. I deploy han with gun to lukes site, but didnt leave enough for my 2 destiny (ARSE!!!!)<br/>
he loses 4 more, while han dies. this goes on, Luke eventually finds his saber, and chops the old man, but home 1 gets lateral damaged and leia dies. the Executor vs Home 1 finishes it.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Knowing i cant play Mat again<br/>
Lows: Playing Mat Again, Lateral damaged home 1<br/>
FL -10<br/>
2 -17<br/>
<br/>
This Round Chazz faced the Peter Di Biasio MKOS, getting beat not quite as bad as me, Fl -21 for him.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:<br/>
<br/>
HB Mains vs Neil Goodacre’s (1713) MKOS<br/>
<br/>
Neither Neil nor myself are having the best of tourneys, so i was quite looking forward to this, as Neil is a funny guy, and a good player too.<br/>
So much for starting Insight, Battle Plan got started all 3 games in this tourney.<br/>
He sets up in the AC 1st turn with jabba and chall (i think), i get Ben K with stick to JP to drain for 3 constantly throughout the game.<br/>
I set up a couple of characters at cloud city for off the edges, but some abyssins and other characters kill them, there is a long skirmish over the cc db.<br/>
He gets galid out so hes outdraining me, and thats the way it finishes. Sorry about the details in that 1, but i was tired and didnt take any notes.<br/>
<br/>
FL -7<br/>
<br/>
Chazz’s HD is involved in a tight game with scott latham’s WYS. Chazz has no way of stopping scott’s retrieval and scott wins by 11, despite Luke<br/>
joining the DS again. (note, Luke was turned by chazz in all 3 games).<br/>
<br/>
I get the Bye in game 6, so i talk to dave the TD, and buy a Lord Vader off him, i watch Chazz play Peter Ashworths SYFCA deck which was a lot like<br/>
matts, cept with tie interceptors. Ties normally slay dagobah, and chazz takes ages to do the 1st couple of tests, so there is no way for him to mount a comeback, and loses by 22.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
