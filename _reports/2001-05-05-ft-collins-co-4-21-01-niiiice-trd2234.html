Editorial- It has come to my attention that when people read my TR’s people get offended when I say mean things and use naughty language.  Because people don’t like this, I lose stars, and thats not good.  So instead I will take a different approach to this TR, it will be a niiiiice TR, where I won’t be mean, and all I have to say are niiiiiice things about people.  Please Enjoy :P<br/>

Ahhhh, it is another Ft. Collins Tournament, and I love playing in my home town at Marshaks House of Fantasy.  So on this occasion I head down there with my mother to drop me off, she’s so niiiice.  Tom Meade part of Loveland Crew was gonna come along later, but I wanted to get there so I could talk to my friend John Arendt who was being niiiiice enough to run yet another Ft. Collins Tourny.  But unfotunatly this time Decipher didn’t get the foils to John in time for this Tourny, but that ok because I know Decipher is a big business and they are making many other card games than SW:CCG so we should be grateful.  Either way John being niiiiiice as usual say the foils are an IOU to whoever gets second and whoever he raffles one to.  So I think there are 12 people there and we start a little after 10:30, but we only are playing 4 games.<br/>
<br/>
Game i John Arendt Dark Surgeon vs Hidden Mains<br/>
Shucks, I didn’t want to play John right away.  Not that I don’t like playing him, I only play him at every Ft. Collins Tourny, but I learn a lot from him as a player since he is one of the best in the world.  Now I’ve never beaten John, so I try to measure my progress with him in coffee spoons.  John is using a deadly deck that he used at states, I think most have you have seen it by now, he usually plays it really good against mains.  So both me and John set up our decks in our fashion, which is great, but he was able to set up Emperor Palpy and Xizor at a CC:DB with a PotF so he could make me lose early force.  I sit back for a little bit waiting for John to split up the two ill-tempered DS Villians (but they are Great cards!)  He does so, but protects Xizor, after building up a team I deploy them to Tatooine, it is Ben w/ lightsaber, Jedi Luke w/ Lightsaber and book, Mirax Terrik, and Lando w/ ax.  this was a great team to come down on Xizor, 4lom, and Boba Fett.  On his turn he battles me, and I use my first action to try and exclude  4lom, I draw a 6 for great for me, but not so great for 4lom, Boba Fires but I block it with the book, now I can’t hit Xizor due to Guri so I swing for Boba Fett and hit, then swing at Guri and he plays the Dark Side Droid Shutdown.  I think John Arendt is really swell because of all of the weird tech cards he uses, it makes him really fun to play.  So I can’t swing at guri so both Jedi’s have to swing at Boba, I miss the first time and hit the  next.  So this battle is looking alright, John Draws a 5 and I get a 4, so he loses Guri and Boba and I revive Lando, I then make a mistake because I get really scared of 4lom and his weapon and I transit the crew to block Emperor Palpatines drain.  Now this was a mistake because all he had was 4 lom and Xizor, I should be able to deal with that, but I was worried about drain of two.  When I move over John Force Lightining’s mirax on my turn, so she goes to lost pile.  On his turn he deploys into space with Zuckuss to my Corulag, he then Lightnings my Lando, eeek.  But thats great I wasn’t angry, because John is a great player and he was subtlely letting me know I made a mistake.  OK, wait I just used sarcasm there and sarcasm is very mean, so I am soooo sorry if I offended you, lets get back to niiiiiice TR.  He then moves Xizor and 4lom over with the Emperor against Ben and Luke, things aren’t looking so good.  So on my turn I notice that since John is in space he is immune to my Battle Plan, which is less than great for me, so I decide to play Home One and Wedge against Zuckuss.  I battle for free and I draw a 5 for destiny since I have 7 ability, I think John drew a two, so he lost Zuckuss and 4 force, and I retook space.  But I realize because I payed all of that force in space i didn’t leave two force to get Ben and Luke out of there, eeek.  So I know John can clear the site and once John can make me lose to Flip Side and drains I will lose.  Full Loss by Nine.<br/>
<br/>
0 -9<br/>
Highs: At least after losing my first game I can scrub out, oh wait, Scrub is a meanhearted term so I’m soooo sorry, remmeber, this is a niiiiice TR.<br/>
Lows: There are no lows, this is a niiiiice TR. <br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Peter Gobel Profit vs. Crouching Skrilling<br/>
Peter is nine years old I think, which is wonderful to the youth playing Star Wars and not smoking crack, its a very positive thing in our society.  So Peter is playing profit and that can throw me off quite a bit since I can’t use my locations to the fullest effect.  I start Jabba and Chall Bekan in the AC so I can get going real quick, and I use chall to get my Merc Pilot.  So I start off by setting up the Sail Barge with the Pilot at the Palace and I draw the rest.  On Peter’s first tuen he plays Master Luke and Corran Horn to the AC, he battles me, tries to bounce an Alien but misses, and he draws a 5 and I draw a 4, so my leaders are immune and he loses Corran horn, instead of taking force loss I lose Chall Bekan, and Peter keeps Luke there.  This is great for Peter because this is the first time he has ever won a battle with me, which I think is great for peter.  So on my turn I drain for 2 with pilot and I come down on Peter with Boelo, Pote, Gailid, and a couple of skrillings, flip objective since no other non-tat locations on table,  I battle and Win and I do quite a bit of damage, how much though I cannot recall, 20+ maybe.  But Peter dosn’t get too discouraged, even when I start draining him for 6 a turn.  He does manage to release Han with that Someone who loves you, and he retreives 10, but is just delays the inevitable.  Peter came out strong but I forced the victory for me, Full Win by 29.<br/>
<br/>
2 +20<br/>
Highs: Playing Peter, he seems so cheerful to play me, it really does bring joy into my life knowing that some one can be that happy to play some one in a tourny!<br/>
Lows: Niiiiiiice TR ;)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Tom Meade Hidden Space Base vs. Crouching Skrillings.<br/>
I have metioned Tom in many of my TRs since we always play each other.  Because of this we know each others decks and playstyles pretty well, I get a little tired of playing tom in every tourny, but he’s my friend so I have but niiiice and swell things to say about him.  I draw my hand and I see monnok in my opening hand, I think thats gonna be good for me.  I set up the AC and Jabba’s Palace in my early turns.  I Once its set up I start to dig for ships to begin the space probing for when he flips.  I hit him with lost monnok on 3rd turn, now he had deployed all of his X=Wings lucky for me, so I hit him for 6 cards with Monnok which were org Attacks, A few Maneuvers, and Signal.  I then use a grabber on his All Wings Report In.  He flips on the next turn and I have two ships in hand, but I also have Den of Theives in play to deal with his kessel Drain, so I start Probe and since he dosn’t have too many X-Wings  left in his deck I know he won’t deploy on me,  I have to probe all 5 planest to find out his Hidden Base is Kessel (he changed his Base like after every time I see him, great play!) As soon as that happens, I use my skrillings as forfeit fodder in space since I parked my ships at Kessel in order to probe so when the beat down comes.  Now that I have my drain of 8 going down at Jabbas palace its really good for me, but not so good for tom.  HE does battle me in space and clears me, but I don’t lose force, although he has battle plan, he has no Menace to Fade with, so I’m paying 9 to drain for 8 and I’m canceling his big drains in space and retrieving skrillings every turn.  I will finish him off due to great resources on my behalf, Full Win by 10, Tom played this game pretty good so no high Diff this time, but I’m so happy I won even though I had low diff!<br/>
<br/>
4 +30<br/>
Highs: Playing my godd friend Tom for the 7th Tournament in a row, Its really great top not only playtest with my friends, but to play them in Tournamnets is really awesome!<br/>
Lows: Niiiiice TR!<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Sean Burns Court Flipper vs. Hidden Mains<br/>
Sean has psted this deck to Deck Tech and he got railed for it, Sean hasn’t been playing that long and he is a fun guy who is into the spirit of Star Wars which I think is a positive thing to see today in the new SW enviroment where you can have Darth Vader and his Momma in the same battle, or people use Objectives just to abuse the Front side, eeek I said abuse and thats not niiiiice.  Anyways I got to play Sean and this was going to be fun because I posted on his deck in hope that it would gettbetter.  Since I am running Hidden Mains I got a really good Force Start, and from this I drew some good Card, like Ben with lightsaber and book and Lando and Ax.  I try to deploy BEn to the AC where Sean has Jabba and some Bounty Hunter, but he None Shall Passes.  I do it iagain on my next turn and he says its ok, so I bring Lando too and we have a scrum in the AC.  I win the battle, not by a lot and clear the AC.  I then invade more of his sites so I crain for a lot at put him at a disadvantage.  He lose his sarlacc pretty early but gets the Rancor goin.  But he is never able to take a captive from me because my mains had such a strong presence in Jabba’s Palace.  I never do get a tracked 6 or anything so I can’t retreive so I get a full Win by 21.  It was really lucky of me to bust into the Palace like I did, Court is a very tricky deck if you let them set up, then its really hard to beat, but I invade on 3rd, 4th Turn so I was able to push those wonderfully useful aliens around with my great mains.<br/>
<br/>
6 +51<br/>
Highs: Hey I won again, and I have pretty good differential soo I might get second place, and maybe first if John lost to Joel Jackson!<br/>
Lows: Come on, its a niiiiice TR!<br/>
<br/>
So John didn’t lose and I got second, which is great!  John being a swell guy was willing to pass on taking a foil for winning his own tourny and he said I would get to pick a foil when he got them in, and I got a pack of DSII and RefII which is a good deal for only paying 3 dollars for the tourny.  I didn’t get anything too wonderful in my packs, so my Japanese Darth Vader streak came to an end, but one can only have so many Japanese Darth Vaders, I think thats a saying.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, afterwards John had brought some Jedi Knights which we played, and I thought it was an enjoyable game since it was made by Decipher, after all they do say, "Decipher, the Art of Great Games".  I’m really happy to see them release naother Star Wars game with the same source Material as SW:CCG, I mean Star Wars is only one of the best selling games on the market, so why not release another Star Wars game!  Those brilliant beautiful people at Deicpher sure know how to make a Star Wars fan happy.  I’ll be so excited when Young Jedi Knights comes out for Episode II because I have so much money to use on Alternative SW games because they are kind of slow on releasing cards for their established award winning CCG.     <br/>
<br/>
