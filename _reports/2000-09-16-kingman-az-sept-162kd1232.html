<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">History: A year and a half ago Tim "info Borker" Guzman and a few of us used to go to the few tournaments they had in Kingman. It usually resulted in those of us from Vegas finishing top 5 with all Kingman locals below. They don’t have a wide player base so they are subject to our oppression, but none-the-less it is still fun to play there.<br/>

<br/>
Here we go... A year and a half since the last Kingman tourney. Friday night before the tournament, my decks are something like this.<br/>
Dark: SYCFA Beatdown<br/>
Light: A borrowed deck known as "The Celebration (The Counterpart)" You should rate it. It is sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I decide I hate my dark deck and I know we have to get up early because it is a 2 hour drive and the tourney starts at 9. I go to sleep, full of hate of my dark deck. I wake up at 3:48 am. Get out my cards and build a quick ROPS deck. It is fairly sweet, but I accidentally put in a stormtrooper cadet. Oh Well!!! Get it built, go to 7-11 and buy a doughnut and go home. My friend Shane "outlaw" Watner shows up and we go to Tim’s house to start our adventure at 6:30. We get there and I find out that the tournament is in a church (important later on). There are like uh, 13 people I believe. Time to start...<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS vs Justin something’s (sorry, don’t know him)ISB<br/>
<br/>
ISB? I wasn’t prepared for ISB from these guys. I hoped that I would come out of this with a win. I was sweating til I saw his starting interrupt.. Twi’lek Advisor for Imperial Decree. Riiiiiiiiight.... No worries. He starts with Imperial Square. I start my stuff (go look at it). His turn he drops a Spaceport Docking Bay to Coruscant and draws. My turn, pull H1 DB and put Melas there. His turn, he drops Chyler and Wulf Yularen to his DB and draws. I tunnel vision, pick up Ben. Deploy Tat: DB and drop Ben and Cracken to it. Transit and draw. He runs and draws. Nothing much goes on for the rest of the game because he is frightened of my mains. I setup my Tatooine Celebration and drain him out. But not until Blount paid Coruscant a visit.<br/>
FW 2+31<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 ROPS vs. Mike M@#$%ie’s A New Secret Base (rated 1620 something.)              <br/>
<br/>
Mike is one of the 2 best Kingman guys. He is a fairly good player. He starts his Hoth junk and I start IAO, Mobile Points, and Imperial Decree. He plays around setting up his base. Meanwhile I get flipped by turn 4. By turn 6 he is set with EBO. I respond by deploying Rendilli. To Rendilli I put Zuckuss and Bossk. I put Saber 1 at the DB I had on Raltiir and Sarkli took it up to Raltiir. Decree in effect. He tries to battle me off of Rendilli but my addition to my destinies proves to be too much for him. Plus he never challenged Sarkli. Eventually my drains and S&amp;D did him in. <br/>
FW +21<br/>
So I’m at 4 +52<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 LS vs Joel M@#$%ie (1731) Mike’s brother<br/>
<br/>
He is the (obviously) more skilled of the two. He starts off with Raltiir Ops. Sigh. I had trouble with this when playtesting my deck. Get my draw. Jedi Luke, EPP Han, Orrimaarko, Boushh. There was some red too, but it didn’t matter. His turn he deploys 2 sites (IAO). My turn. H1 DB, Luke, transit. He responds with Blizzard 2 and Marquand. He battles and I Narrow Escape. I deploy Tatooine DB and Boushh undercover and Epp Han to the H1 DB. Transit Han and Move Luke back over. He drops U-3P and moves away so he can stockpile some force. I move Liea on his turn to Raltiir. I can’t drain coz of the spy, so I start setting up Tatooine. Lando in Gold Sq.1 and Melas to Tat DB and Nien Numb to the newly deployed SP DB on Tatooine. Enter Tatooine Celebration. H e reads it and puts it on his side of the table. I ended up forgetting it for 2 turns until he said, "oh yeah, here you go." Anyways, he dropped a bunch of walkers and such on Raltiir forcing me to abandon the planet. He flips. I rally a fleet at his system and deploy I’ll Take The Leader to pick up some drains at my DB’s. He Brings Vader, Tarkin and Ozzel to fight my Luke, Han, and Melas. He kills me on power, so I lose my Jedi, knowing I had Luke w/saber in hand. He draws and p@#$%es. By now I had control of the Raltiir system. I deploy Orri to the H1 DB and transit to Raltiir DB where he has TScout 3 and Col. Davod Jon. If I can take the site, his objective will flip back. I had also deployed Luke w/saber with Han and Melas. Battle, I killed Ozzel and I lost Melas. I draw 2. yes... He activates and hastily initiates battle vs. Orri at the docking bay. I play Fallen Portal. He lose Davod Jon. I clear the site with my destiny and flip his objective back.  My game from there. Drains at the DB’s kill him off.<br/>
FW +19<br/>
6+71<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 ROPS vs Joel’s RST<br/>
<br/>
I usually don’t lose to decks that try to blow the bunker. He rallied his scouts and gnerals at the Rebel Landing Site while I setup my flip. It was ugly from there. All he could do is slowly drain for 1 at the bunker. I had Battle Order holding it down with Zuckuss running space. when he got down to his last 3 cards he tried to blow the bunker. He had 2 charges and the guy who adds 1 to total for each charge there. He had 8 and 2 draws. I didn’t really want to lose 8 cards right at the end. He drew a 0 and a 1. <br/>
FW+21<br/>
8+92<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Rops vs. Tim Guzman’s Dagobah beatdown<br/>
<br/>
This started bad. I was so concerned to flip I din’t pay attention to his force pile and what not. It was fun to pplay Tim, but Jedi Luke with Yoda at his Hut is indestructable. I couldn’t get a lightsaber forever. I made a last ditch effort to kill Luke with an At-St Pilot in TScout 5. I needed to draw a 5 to kill Luke. I drew a 3. I just could not kill Luke and Anger, Fear, Aggression forced me to battle when I wasn’t ready. Luke is a machine. <br/>
FL-25<br/>
8+77<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: LS vs. Tim’s BHBM<br/>
<br/>
I had a fair hand with JLuke and EPP Han. He ended up with a better hand. Emperor from reserve and eventually met up with all his advisors. I couldn’t draw anything good to save my life. He would play Imperial Barrier on my helper characters when I was ready to battle. I would end up battling anyways and losing. Stack a card. Then on his turn he beat up the remaining guys. Stack a card. But he didn’t convert Luke. I lost mostly on battle damage after the Emperor, Sim, Janus, and IG-88 whooped Han. I did drain him slowly at the end though, to keep it close. <br/>
FL-8<br/>
8+61<br/>
<br/>
So I took 4th after getting surp@#$%ed in differential by 2 guys. Shane got 2nd, and Mike M@#$%ie got 3rd. Tim won with 12+147 or so. It was a fun tournament overall though. If you can ever get to the Kingman area for a tournament, I highly recommend it. They need more people from outside of their area so they can expand their playing horizons. Thanks for your time.  </font></td>
