<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well here goes my latest attempt at improve my recorded at SWCCG<br/>
<br/>
I have been looking forward to this for a month and a half since the last tournament.  I do not make it to many tournaments but have been trying to do 1 a month now that my 8 year has started to play it gives us both something to do that is just the 2 of use without his 3 younger brothers.  Anyway we get to Booster Pack Game formerly Broken Games and wait about 15 minute for them to open.  We have 8 people which good, considering a lot of the player migrated to LOTR and there is a tour. for it at the same time. Well we get started after fifteen minutes or so.<br/>
<br/>
I am playing an updated version of my City in the Clouds (QMC) Deck and my faithful, but not as good as it was before WYS, Do Not Mess With the Desilijac(sp)(Court) Deck.<br/>
<br/>
My son is playing his Gungan Shield Deck and a You May Start Your Landing Deck that I have build for him so he can get into the game.  Neither deck is great but has potential, and the more he learns the better they will work for him.  <br/>
<br/>
Well last tournament I went 3-3 (-something) cam in 6th out of 10.  The only problem was I ended up playing my son twice in the last 3 rounds.  Well this time with even fewer people we get paired up on the first round.<br/>
<br/>
My DNMWTD vs. my son (1507) Gungan Shields of Naboo<br/>
<br/>
Well like I said this kind of stinks cause I built his deck and he is tired of losing to dad.  And you all out there gripe and moan about playing your friends and Tournament in the first Round.  Any way we get started and he sets up on Naboo and I set up on Tat. He decides  he can out drain me on Naboo and get ahead as long as there are no battles and losing 1 to Court every turn would even it out a bit but he cannot get out his Battle plain to set up the heavy drain.  I got squat in the opening hand and had to draw a lot to get setup.  He did manage to get Naboo out and a couple of Naboo Fighters but I pulled ZinMH with Court and smoked them and sat there for a drain of 2.  I finally get Tat. setup and decide to go after him.  I get drop some Bounty Hunters his &lt;&gt; Forrest and walk into the Entrance of Otogunga (sp) where he is staging getting ready to spread.  He Battles and I Capture a Gungan Guard and with IG-88 w/gun and shot and miss Boss Nass with Dengar w/gun so I waste the second shot to take him out.  When all is said and don Nass is gone JarJar is at Brisky morning Munchin and a Gungan General is gone.  Both my guys are gone because of him drawing a 4 and a 5 for Destiny.  He gets a really kick out beating dad in a battle. Well we drain a while longer and he tries to block ZinMH from draining and next turn I Pull BinHT and drop a beat down on Bravo Fighter and a Naboo Fighter.  Well that took some wind out of his sails until I dropped Aurra Sing and another Chokk to one of his Shielded sites.  He has a Fambaa and a Gungan Guard, Boss Nass is a few sites away adds a destiny thus the Chokk to cover.  WRONG, he pulls a Destiny 3 Gungan the for battle destiny the Guard make it a 5 I pull a  3 so the battle is a tie and we both lose to attrition except he has Steady Steady out and his Guard is immune to attrition less than 4. So not only does he keep the Guard but I either lose Aurra and leave Chokk to face a Power 4 Fambaa and a destiny next turn or lose Chokk and then Aurra to clear me, that is what I end up doing.  The rest of the game we just drain I spread on Tat. and drain and ping him with Court.<br/>
FW (+28)<br/>
<br/>
HL: Winning the first Game YipeeKyeAye. (drips with sarcasm)<br/>
LL: having to play and beat my son in the first round and losing 2 ground battles in the process.<br/>
<br/>
2 (+28)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my QMC vs. Joshua Stecker (1676) TDIGWATT<br/>
<br/>
I take one look at this deck and I am like great Free Big E and this is going to be a Blood Bath.  And it pretty much was. I got a Ship and some characters in the opening draw. And thought there was hope by second turn he had dropped enough sights for me to Drop the GS1 right in Front of the Big E and Friends, 2 characters at different Sights and Flip using KTEOF and land the ship.  So I start draining and we gets AO We*er in attack Position Now and setup DD. So I am getting pinged every where and gets CCO out and I am losing huge. I can not use my Sabacc to get my retrieval going because he keeps losing a card using the DS to cancel my cards.  I Take off and cancel DD and go after his commanders and Generals on the Ground.  Had I been think and I just no realized this as I write that I should have drop another ship at Bespin when I got a AO of my on to cancel his but that did not done on my turn I dropped Obi w/stick and Chewie w/gun to Vader and Igar at the Carbon Chamber.  That was a trap.  I Swung and hit Vader and shot and missed Igar.  He Swung at Obi and All too Easily froze Obi I lose 8 and he now gets a Destiny and I do not.  Chewie and Vader are gone and Obi is a Popsicle.  Well from there on out we both drained while he Pinged me with the AO and CCO.<br/>
FL (-11)<br/>
<br/>
HL: Thank God Purcimr was boosting my drains.<br/>
LL: not having the shield that cancels MobP game text I do not own one yet.  Having My Sabacc canceled. Not thing of swapping out AO*s.<br/>
<br/>
2(+17)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
Court vs. Tom did not get your last name TIGIH (Mid 1500*s)<br/>
<br/>
Well I have only gone up against 1 of these in the past and beat it so I am think tough game but I should be able to take him.  Well he starts out with at Chirpa*s place with stick and signals for Light Saber Proficiency.  Write off the bat I am losing to a Force drain of to but I pull a God Hand. 6 BH and Scum with another card.  So I drop and spread get Galid out and he starts building a Crew to come after me. I have all my sites out by turn 4 and the Barge and IG w/gun and Snoova and his weapon of choice out at one of my DB*s and wait it stay pretty even he come over and a scuffle ensues. I Capture Obi after excluding Panaka and he loses some. I battle next turn and capture somebody else then move Snoova on the Barge over and drain and left IG and his captive at the DB with his crew.  Well next turn he starts moving toward the AC so I move over some more. Well he plays Battle Plan DS and we both start pay for drains unfortunately I had over deployed a bit and was down a few more cards I then realize that if I get Snoova over to the great Forest of Endor I can get higher drain for the 3 I have to Pay. Unfortunately I realize this about 2 turns too late and after a couple turns I can not pay for enough drains to win so with 2 cards left I Draw up.<br/>
FL (-5)<br/>
<br/>
HL: Capturing Obi and another main.<br/>
LL: Losing both the Sarlacc and Rancor to drains early in the game.  Losing when I should have won.<br/>
<br/>
2(+12)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
<br/>
QMC vs. Zach Jones Dark Jedi Drain like crazy on Tat. (mid 1600*s)<br/>
<br/>
I have played Zach in the past but this is the first time that I have played against one of his DS decks I am just thankful I am not going against his WYS. I draw a huge hand especially against his deck, Uncontrollable Fury plus the Casino and every thing else I need to Flip.  He started off by putting out Blizzard 4 and using it to deploy DVDLOTS for free. Well you should have seen the look on his face when I hit him with a first turn Fury he lost to it the entire game.  I get flipped and he sets up drains on Tat. and it is pretty even until I kick in the Sabbacs. I get Battle Plan out as soon as I flip and he has to pay for all of his drains and loses 2ZinMH off the top early.  Then he gets his only other ship in hand Big E and cannot deploy because he is not activating enough.  I get PT out to boost my drains and between that and Sabbac I drain him out while retrieving enough to stay ahead.  Over all it was an uneventful game.<br/>
FW (17)<br/>
<br/>
HL: First Turn Fury, making him pay for all of the drains. Winning like 8 hands of Sabbac.<br/>
LL: none, Maybe over Deploying a bit and hurting my Dif.<br/>
<br/>
4(+29)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
<br/>
Court vs. Zack Jones WYS<br/>
<br/>
Remember how lucky I thought I was not play Zack*s WYS.  Well I new this was a loss Court cannot beat a good WYS.  So we get set and he get Kessel out with Mirax in her ship there I drop ZinMH and Stinger Figure I can drop her and control space until he can get more out.  Well I draw 3 for Destiny so she is immune and he loses a few.  Well I make a huge mistake that while it may not have cost me the game it did cost my dif. at the end.  Next Turn he get Nett and ship and drops I*ll take the Leader. I get hammered and he drops Battle Plan moves to Tat. and Celebrates. Well I attack a Luke with stick and he draws just enough to make me lose both BH*s from there on it was me drain and him drain and retrieve I tried battling again at a weak spot and he Dodged it.<br/>
FL (-28)<br/>
<br/>
HL: None<br/>
LL: what was not low about this game?<br/>
<br/>
4 (+1)<br/>
<br/>
Well I am wondering who I am going to end up playing in the text round and wondering if I can pull off a decent win.  I have no shot at winning the tournament two guys are 5-1 and most of the rest of us are 2-3 or 3-2 with the exception of 2.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
<br/>
QMC vs. My son and his DS deck<br/>
<br/>
This stinks 2 tournaments in a row I have to Play my son to games.<br/>
<br/>
Last time we played this match up I barely won because he beat me at Sabbac 10 out of 12 hands.  Well this time my deck worked much better.  He set up on Hoth and I did my thing he had trouble getting setup so I broke out to an early lead once I realized he was not going to come after me and I had flipped I we started playing Sabbac and that was it. The first part of the game he kept asking are you ready to play Sabbac over and over because he new it was coming.  Well out of about 15 hands of Sabbac and Winning a DinP1 and 14 out of 15 with 1 tie I had no cards in my lost pile and his deck was gone.<br/>
FW (41)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I finished 3-3(+42) and took third first time I have ever placed at a tournament.  We all got **god Packs** which were sleeves with 6 random rares.  <br/>
<br/>
