<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Where do I begin?  It’s been awhile since I posted anything to decktech, so here goes.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve been very away from the game since the Endor regional, not really thinking of new decks, nor scouring the net for ideas.  Since the regional, I’ve been married, honeymooned, worked alot, and not really spent much time on the card game.  Well, with the fortnight leading to worlds, I’ve decided to play and build everyday.  I spent much time talking with my fellow endorians, coming up with the best stuff possible.  With a short time to go before worlds, I was at a loss.  I talked to Doug Harvilla, and asked him for his Huntdown deck list, because I’ve got respect for the deck, since he’s been working it into a machine for the past year.  I figure I can 4-0 with it, which makes me need to find a light that can go 2-2.  Seems easy right?  Well, since I’ve played nothin but Profit for the past 8 months, I was kinda screwed, considering all the BHBM that I expected to see.  So, the search was on, and I was looking for the light.  I tryed out a There’s good in him/scout variation with some good ewoks, and it did well in testing, but got killed by huntdown and BHBM.  So, I go back to the drawing board, and try to come up with something else.  Joe Olson has a good hidden base flipper built, and we try it out in alot of games, but I don’t feel that great with it.  I’ve never trusted EBO, cause I never had a problem beating it, even in the olden days of baragwins without CHYBC to mess with them.  <br/>
<br/>
So, after a 12 hour playtest at Mike Mikaelians house, we are all still baffled on what to play.  That was saturday before worlds.  I decided that huntdown was the deck to play for me, and that I’d get a lightside pile between then and thursday.  So, I work Monday and Tuesday, and Wednesday morning, Joe gets dropped off at my house, so we can go to the airport that afternoon.  <br/>
<br/>
**********Enter Travel Mode****************<br/>
<br/>
Joe and I are cruising through the airport, and I’m contimplating buying the new playboy with Chyna, but figure not to, considering I have a 1400 page book I’m reading, and Joes 15. <br/>
<br/>
*Editors note*  For those that have never read the Dragon Lance Chronicles, I suggest it.  It’s good fantasy, and a fun read----end.<br/>
<br/>
so, Joe and I are hanging out in the terminal, and I’m like, "Joe, I don’t know what to play."  Joe’s like, ah, you’re the best, you win with whatever.  "<i>riiight</i>" <br/>
So we get on the plane, and I basically throw Joe over the heads of 10 people, to get a seat in the emergency exit row.  Now that’s leg room at it’s finest.  Thanks for taking one for the team Joe.  So, Joe and I discuss some tech, and I tell him that fallen portal will be huge, and we both agree that sac will be cool...<br/>
<br/>
Well, after 6 hours, and about 300 pages of Dragonlance, we land in Orlando, with out any playing of Star Wars, much to my displeasure, but hey, like there was room.<br/>
<br/>
So, we get off, ride the cool monorail, hook up with Mike and his wife, and head out to the hotel.  We drop off joe and Shauna, and head back to pick up the "Fur Guy" Peter Sundholm...<br/>
<br/>
*editors note:  Read Dominics report*<br/>
<br/>
Well, Peter has left the airport, but as soon I walk in wearing my WotC vest someone asks, "hey, you looking for someone?"  It’s Tim Leung from California, with I-ming Chen and John Borders, and someone else.  Well, since Peter left, we take John and Tim back, and leave I-ming and dude to fend for themselves.  So, we make it to the hotel.<br/>
<br/>
***********Enter D-con mode****************<br/>
<br/>
Thursday morning A.M.<br/>
We enter the hotel, looking for Joe and Peter.  I’m trying to find out what room he’s in, but the dumb @#$% at the desk is still checking in the germans that I was 45 minutes earlier, when we first dropped joe off.  WTF... I call the help phone, and after 4 minutes, some @#$% picks up, and sends me to the wrong room.  C’mon Double tree, I have a damn tourny in 10 hours (actually 14)and need my buddys floor.  so, after pacing downstairs, meeting Jim Li in line, and wondering where the hell Joe is, he and Peter come downstairs.  <br/>
"Charles, I just saw this tight deck that lingrell was playing, it’s Hidden base with celebration, mains, and docking bays.  It uses Fallen portals and stuff.  It’s mad tech!"  so, it’s got fallen portals, and the drains at docking bays, with fallen portal. hmmmmmmm.  "Okay Joe, I’m convinced."<br/>
<br/>
So, we go to Joes room, and sit down and buiold this deck.  It works in testing, but I wish I had something else.  Oh well, it’s late, and I got nothing.  This deck can give me a 2-2 effort.  So, come 4 in the morning, we go to sleep.<br/>
After 4 hours, I get up at 8, and grab breakfast.  We go to stand in the FUC&amp;ING PRE REG LINE for like 2 hours.  What the hell, this is a prereg line, and it’s like 2 hours long.  But if you didn’t prereg, you can go to the front, and for 5 bucks more, not hassle with the line.  Dude, that is FU@%^d $hit!  Oh well, I guess my foil corvette is worth it.  So, I’m in line, and there’s this freek looking dude with spiky hair walking around, and I glance at his name badge.  It’s Dominic from Quebec!  I’m like, "Hey, Dominic!"  He has the look of, "Who the hell is this huge guy saying hi to me."  I introdude myself, and that was the beginning of a friendship I do believe.  Dominic is phatty boom batty.  You rock dude!  So, I have my decklist filled, didn’t bother counting them (thanks god I can fill out a simple list) and get registered.  So I enter the con area, and notice all the hunnies working the decipher store.  Wow, how much shorter could those shorts go.  <br/>
<br/>
I enter into the con hall, and all us endor guys are hanging around one of the tables.  So, we have Myself, Mike Mikaelian, Joe Olson, Peter Sundholm, Jason Kilby, Don Kitzman and Jason Denee all chilling for the start time.  Someone hands Kilby a card to fling, and he lets it rip.  This card goes from one end of the convention hall to the other, and actually lands in the chandelier at the opposite end.  There was no one in the Decipher olympics that was beating that throw all weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
***Enter time warp mode, cause you all know about the hellish delay***<br/>
<br/>
some details are fuzzy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Decks:<br/>
LS:  Hidden base/DB/mains and portals<br/>
DS:  Harvilla hundown with a few cards changed<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 begins:<br/>
LS vs. Greg Pounds SYCFA/SFS<br/>
<br/>
I get Lando and Nien and falcon out quick, takeoever wak, and take control of the game.  Not really a contest.  Bantha droid made him pitch 2 Lateral Damages.<br/>
FW by something...<br/>
<br/>
highs:  I won<br/>
Lows:   none<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 <br/>
DS vs. Clay Ramey ( I think) TGIH deck<br/>
<br/>
He had a TGIH deck, my hand sucked.   I grap Luke with Vader, and drain against my better judgement.  lost in the wilderness.  sense - control... well crap.. Okay, Vaders missing.  Mara comes down, get’s luke, and on the next turn, finds Vader.  I get to the mobile DB’s, and start the hurt.  He deploys Captain Solo to kessel, and goes.  I drop zuckuz and bossk, battle.  He plays, I know. Sense.  control<br/>
Sense again... haha....  I pound the falcon.  Okay, so he’s @#$%ing, saying how this deck has never lost, etc.  Whatever, I kicked your butt.<br/>
<br/>
highs:  I won<br/>
Lows:  Um, Charlie Herran, I think you know this guy.  He’s ass.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
DS vs. Goeff Snyders profit with hella mains...<br/>
I start Mara and Jabba, have no saber to searh for, he dropps luke and ben turn 1, clears the site.  Doesn’t free han.  I drop Vader to the Palace, and he moves over (doesn’t free Han)  I monnok, he loses 2 bens, 2 lukes, 2 take me to jabas 2 alter... he has a EPP Han, and something in hand.  I move Vader over, and search for a I have you now.  He sits at the palace, and 2 turns later, deploys leia, and moves over to the chamber.  in this time, I’ve tracked 2 sixes, and deploy IG-88, Vaders saber, and Battle.  Capture Obi, hit luke, Beaten Leia, and play IHYN.  He loses luke and 15.  That was pretty much game.<br/>
FW by something<br/>
<br/>
highs:  Some Endor revenge after he beat Joe game 1<br/>
Lows:  That monnok sucked for you man. who the hell plays monnok?<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
LS vs. Dominics "THE MACHINE"<br/>
What can I say, the machine kicked my candy A$$.  good game, and my never playing against a BHBM showed.<br/>
FL by too much<br/>
<br/>
highs:  Playing Dom.  Before the game, we were both jovial and friends, were competitors during, and hung out afterword as friends<br/>
Lows: Playing Dom.  I hate playing new friends.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
DS vs. franks Hidden base Y-wing.<br/>
This dude was freeky, he made day 2 with a light deck that sucked, but went like 3-1 on the day.  weird.  I shut his @#$% down, kicked his @#$% in space, and slaughtered him...  but hey, the dude made day 2.<br/>
FW...<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Total control.  He had nothing<br/>
Lows:  I was worried about making a mistake, because this is the dude that you may underestimate.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I’m 4-1, with three games left.  I know hunt will win, and I need 1 more light win and I’m in.  Easy right?  Wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
LS vs. Jason Burrows SYC/SFS<br/>
okay, I have a good hand, and he drops all his systems from his... him, good starts.  I drop Falcon, Lando, and Nien to Wak, and draw a few.  his SECOND turn, he drops zuckus and a dreadnaught, with lateral damage, and lays a 13 point smacking.  Okay, this is @#$%ty.  this is TURN 2, and in the 3 cards I picked up, theres the fricking bantha droid!  What @#$% is that.  All your systems and zuckus, dreadnuaght and a lat damage the first 13 cards off your deck?  Well Jason, that singlehandedly put you in day 2, and kept me out.  I played it out, but it was a tough defeat.  good game burrows.  <br/>
<br/>
Highs:  My opening hand was awsome<br/>
Lows:   Damn my deck cuts<br/>
<br/>
********Friday*************<br/>
Game 7<br/>
DS vs. Mike "My best man in my wedding" Mikaelians LS <br/>
well, Mikes playing the same deck as myself and joe, and I play kinda stupid.  He has a chance to slap down legendary starfighter, but doesn’t.  He has total control of the game, but I win by 6 somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  I won somehow<br/>
Lows:  playing a teammate, a best friend, my best man, and knocking one of us out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8<br/>
LS vs. Jimmy’s Rallops (from France)<br/>
@#$%, I need this win to make day 2, cause my diff sucks ass.  I get a decent start, try taking over ralliter, but am just one ship short of controlling him in space.  My squad goes down, but obi dies to a total destiny of 5 with vaders saber, to bad that new vader adds 2.  so, I get beat up off of ralliter, am one ship short of killing zuckus, and find both my laser cannons in my final 4 force.  Suck.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy was a smart player, and I’d like to thank him for making me play my visored visions lost (he grabbed that faster than I have seen anyone use a suckdown)<br/>
<br/>
I lose by 15<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
okay, so I finish like 10 +20, so like 10 points from the final cut.<br/>
<br/>
so sad :-( <br/>
<br/>
I go to sleep, and wake up at like 2.  Wander around the con, meet some dudes, se how everyone is doing.  Get some pick up games in with my brangus deck, it works well.<br/>
<br/>
My wife flies in that night, and Mike and I pick her up.  We come back, Mike takes off for the double tree, and I go on to win the Bread Game. (or at least come in second depending on what happened with Hayes Hunter).<br/>
<br/>
Saturday:<br/>
<br/>
This is the day, Me against Universal Studios.<br/>
<br/>
Me vs. The Hulk.  <br/>
After long lines, and a boring cartoon, I mount the ride.  I scure my harness, ooh, tight, not good.  The ride starts, It goes fast, and upside down, I almost lost it, but pulled it out.... wooohh..<br/>
<br/>
Next, Me versus Dr. Dooms tower of terror.<br/>
I lost my stomach, only to have it show up in my used pile.    Ful loss<br/>
<br/>
I ventured into the water territory next, and was delivered a devestating loss.  <br/>
<br/>
I defeated the dueling dragons, and dodged the sharp teeth of T-rex...<br/>
<br/>
Final conflict of the day, a 10 spot vs. the soda machine.  I recieved the new dollar coin as change, ouch.  that is harsh.  I can’t even use that @#$% for the tolls in the roads.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night.  I play in an 8 man.<br/>
<br/>
I play some old tatooine dudes, Josh Martin and Brain Garrison, and play some freek guy that was insulted that I narrow escaped away from his 200 power troopers, and was even more miffed when I told him that insurrection was out and he couldn’t ellis after me.  whatever freek.  Go play Magic or something, SW players are supposed to be cool.  I play Mikaelian beating him, and win the 8 man.  Brangus is cool.<br/>
<br/>
I pick up Yannick, and buy him a beer.  I hanf out with like 6 foreign dudes, and am the only america at the table.  Some gusy is playing that trooper ralliter deck, and My profit slaughters it.  cool.  To bad the new JPOTSD objectives screws evasion profit.  If I can’t leave a desert, what the hell am I supposed to do?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****sunday******<br/>
<br/>
We pack up, I visit the decipher store (yeah, bend over and grab those Mara Jade cards!)  I miss Shannon signing my cards, and get in some friendly games with guys, hanging out with friends, and talking with other people.  This was the say high to everyone day.<br/>
