<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I was Looking forward to this tournement , because i never Went to this shop .First i wanna say that this was a hugly tournement because Francis Savaria ( Troy Caster , Pipo) won, and its the last person that we wanna see win a tournement, he is so #$%^&amp;^   Hey , I am just joking here Francis :). But if it wasen for a True Tie , i would have won . The Tourney was at 10:30 am and i had made my deck at 6:30 am , so it mean i had slept 150 minutes , i was sooooo tired (as usual). For my dark side , I had choosen the same stupid HDADTJ for the 4 th consecutive tournement  with the Much Anger in him/Responsability of commant combo ( if u dont know that combo , its like Order to engage , and Yoda Gimer Stick , but in stronger) . My Light Side was a one turn beat deck start MWYHL with Batle Plan Start (Yanick Lapointe World C day 1 deck ), it was pretty risky with crush the rebellion , but i never saw a dark cloud city deck with crush the rebellion , so i used it. Neverthelessit  was a pretty cool tournement , because almost all my friend were there ,  even Raphael Asselin , wich is pretty rare. And I had a good Laugh<br/>
<br/>
I didnt thaught i would wrote a tournement report , so i did not took notes between matches . but ill do my best to remember.<br/>
<br/>
It was a 6 game tournement . i think we were like maybe 15 player or so. I was afraid of playing my friend Dominic Bouchard (2 highest ranked player in my region)on first round , because we were a little late , but it was ok , because yanick lapointe was waiting for me to give him some rebel snowspeeder, so the tournement had not started , so i played a unknown player for first round :) hehe that start well a day<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : My HDADTJ vs Hmmm Sherman WOMAN deck with the new CC objective , hehe<br/>
<br/>
In That game , I coundt stop laughing , it was too funny , I learn later that that guy was the owner of this shop . I start IAO and he Start Bargaining Table. First Turn I put down Vader at CC guess Quarter, and i alter his bargaining table, and deploy secret plan.. On his turn , i think he deploy some cloud car at bespin cloud city . Second Turn , i put Tarkin . he does nothing . 3rd turn , i put down the executor at bespin with a presence of the force . Now comes the funny part . There was only 2 CC sites . I was on CC guess chamber , and he was at the site where i dont have Icon ( i could not move vader + tarkin , because i deploy the Executor)  , he had a female warior (alderand operatif i think) , with a Kind of blaster that shoot at adgacent site , she also had a fusion generator , and a remote that make it shoot in control phase (LOL) . He Shoot Vader , play blaster proficiency , i sense it , got it , but he manage to hit vader , then He deploy oola , and he did a small beatdown to tarkin , wich i ghyyk.. The following Turn , I deploy another vader , Ig-88 , and i move Ig-88 To his site . next turn , he shoot vader , but miss , he Oola me , but I shoking Revelation her . then I set up on my drain 2 site with some random A4 alien and some walker. Ig-88 attack , captura Twash Khaa , draw a 7 for destiny ( not track , it was pure luck).Then My Drain Catches Him.<br/>

<br/>
Highlights: Laughing all the game , the guy was very cool<br/>
Lowlights: He didnt deploy any main , so my combo was useless :( also , each turn , i looked in my deck with secret plan for my slave 1 with bob or the buss , but it was always there . so i never draw them , and he drain me each turn in the 2 cloud<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : My MWYHL 1 turn kill VS another unknown player !!! that is my lucky day. he was playing ISB with Probe Droid and Piet.<br/>
<br/>
Boy That Game was fast . First Turn he deploy a location without activating. This Is rediculous . Everybody was laughing . He realise it 1 second after deploying it. I would have let him take back an action and a phase , but he didnt assk me.On my turn , I put Yoda Hutt , Yoda . and i draw.He deploy a planet , and draw . I Yoda Stew. Next Turn i put war not make one Great . I draw . On His Turn , he deploy Piet at a site where i dont have force icon .I Yoda Stew . On My Turn I draw . On his turn , I Yoda Stew , He Deploy Avenger to Kiffex. On My Turn , I draw . On His Turn I Yoda Stew ( I wanted to kill him next turn , so i put 3 It Could be worst) He Pay 4 To Drain Me , I ITCBW , he play Its Worst of 6 ??? WTF . I did not had another ITCBW. Ok , i dont care . Next Turn . I deploy Frozen Asset , Draw Their Fire , Leia Premiere in fromt of piet . All MY EPP . I attack. I play 6 Destiny Adder , so I draw 15 batle destiny . I had about 80 power to his 4 with the probe droid. <br/>

<br/>
Highlights: My deck Working As I planed , It was the first time I played It , yoda Stew Is Great.<br/>
Lowlights: Its Worst of 6<br/>
<br/>
Now We Went To Have Diner , We should have went to McDonald but We Went To eat chicken . but when my turn came to order  , there was no chicken left WTF!!!!! That Was Gay . So I went back to the shop and eat some frites from some of my friend . ( they were cold) luckily for me I had brought some candy. But When I came to eat it , I realise that they were almost all gone , and i had only eat 1 !!!!<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: None Really<br/>
Lowlights: I am Still HUNGRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My Light Side Deck VS Yannick Lapointe (first In My region) Tempest Scout Operative on Corulag<br/>
<br/>
It was a verry serious game , maybe the more serious i ever played against him, we almost never talk. I did not knew If I should start TPTIFF or Batle Plan . So I ask Yanick :) and he told me battle Plan , so i put batle plan .hehe. i did not really care because I had 3 the Signal . He also forgot to activate . hehe just joking. He start Bad Feeling have I . So I know i wont have enough force to deploy Obi Wan on my beatdown crew .First Turn he deploy 1 operative and 1 walker . On My Turn I put Yoda Hut (without Yoda) . Deploy TPTIFF . I draw , Then I play descent into the dark . On His Turn , I Yoda Stew , ITCBW his drain , but He Grapple It. That was Bad . For The Next Few Turn , I drew and Play Yoda Stew . While He Played Very Agressively . Fliping his objective Fast And PutingBob In Slave 1 At His Planet For Batle Plan. I knew I could not wait more time , so i play a Grimtash Lost . I got 2 Trample and 2 Rebel Barier . I put Draw Their Fire , Frozen Asset  , or his walker would react. I only had 4 destiny Adder , but I was confident . I put EPP Han , Leia, Luke , Chewi . I attack .I drew 11 batle destiny , but alot of those were litle destiny , so He did not die ( or maybe he did ??? who knows ???)  . well thing is that i could not drain , nor could he ,because of batle plan and War Not Make 1 Great. Well we did a True Tie . Kind of weird . <br/>

Highlights: It was a good match , we were intensively  concentrated. <br/>
Lowlights: Nothing<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:My Dark Deck Against Francis Savaria Hiden Base manipulation junk and crap deck with undercover and Odds<br/>
<br/>
I know i was supose to loose because i had try alot of matches VS this kind of deck. Well i start Security Precaution . My starting hand was good for a change . I had 1 batle ground , Vader , Executor , and a Death Squadron Star Destroyer. First Turn , he play transmision terminated  OhOh then I deploy My site . And Draw . Next Turn I put Vader At A Batle Ground .Meanwhile he Put Some Planet And Some Starship . Then I put the executor , he barier It , I sense It , ohhhhhh ohhhhh noooooo ohhhhhh @#$%ttttt, I dont have a sense , crap , I used 9 more force to deploy a death squadron star destroyer ( i forgot he was deploy -2 because of executor) attack his lone corvette , he play Full Trotle , hehe just joking , he lost 2 force . He Start Putting starship everywere and removing my starship from my force pile  with Shasa Tiel . I really dont know why , but he flip his hiden base after i did the only 2 force drain i was going to do this turn  ??? weird ??? where does that guy learn to play . On his turn He put a undercover Artoo where i have my vader ??? wtf!!! i was only draining at 2 location and he could cancel them with Hiden Base , i cant believe i am gonna loose to someone who make so huge mistake . I was trying to probe desperatly while he was draining me like a mad . That turn , I draw 1 sense to cancel the ITCBW if i manage to probe the right system , and 1 visage of the Emperor , with a (another) torture . So when he drain me i loose my torture , i saw a grimtaash when he looked for something that was not in his reserve deck . when he notice that he play me a Never Tell me the odds. On My turn I activated a bit too much , so i played torture on the insert , i knew he had another 1. I move to another planet knowing It was my last chance to probe rightly , they was only 3 planet left to probe . So I look carefully behing the hiden base platet that was face down , to see the quality of the card , the quality was poor , so between kessel , tatooine and bespin , it should have been tatooine or kessel (premiere is the oldest) , but knowing that guy , i knew all his card were in bad shape , so i went to bespin . Wrong Choice!!!! it was kessel , the next turn , he drain me and the insert  reach the top . I died there :(<br/>

<br/>
Highlights: My starting hand was good.<br/>
Lowlights: i forgot to make him loose force to the visage about 4 time , and i forgot the deploy -2 of the death squadron , my only 2 mistake of the tournement . And Not probing his hiden base in 6 try.Also , he knew my deck , so he knew that it was not a good idea to deploy Luke or Ben , but i wish he did.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My Light Side VS Dominic Bouchard Tempest Scout Operative on Corulag<br/>
<br/>
I start my usual start , batle plan , he also start bad feeling like Yanick . That Time I was not going to make a Tru Tie . I was doing my usual stuff (draw , yoda stew) while I was playing ITCBW on all his drain , but he never grabled it , he flip the objective , i was ready to kill him , but i needed a grimtaash to remove his trample , so i drew again, I got it , I play it lost , ouch , i got 4 trample and 3 Imperial Barrier , and 2 operatives :) I think he had 1 card left in hand.  On his turn he realise that I had a 1 turn beat, so he deploy the executor , then , he put all his character on the same site , fliping back the objective , and he shuttle his 2 more operative in the executor. he had too much power/forfeit on ground , so i decide to beatdown the Executor . Then Ohhh @#$% I realise i dont have a starship. hmmm i dont wanna draw all my force pile again . Well I have no choice , go for It , I start Drawing Like a mad Till I find My trafic Control and My Spiral . I put all my useless card in my used pile witch were recirculating imediatly with descent into the dark. When I only had my hand and my force pile , I put Draw Their Fire ,Frozen Asset then The Spiral In front of the executor , EPP Leia as a Pilot , EPP han as a pilot , Luke As a Pilot ,and Chewbacca as a Passenger . I attack , he had 12 power , i had 11 , I play Ive Got A bad Feeling about this , so battle damage is tripled. I play 6 destiny adder so i drew 15 batle destiny. So the batle damage was about 150. He lost... the game ...<br/>

Highlights:well 150 batle damage is cool<br/>

<br/>
Game 6: My Dark Deck VS Ohh I cant Believe It not another unknown player , thats just too cool, Well he was using the new CC objective and he was supose to flip it .hmmm<br/>
<br/>
I did not know if he had some Nabrun Leid , so I start IAO . Vader Hit Leia Guess Chamber on first Turn. on his turn he put Bron Burn and attack me ??? is he crazy ??? well after the game he told me he add 12 lift tube in his deck :) he drew a 3 and I drew a 1 , so he forfeit the litle guy and he is ok. I put like 3 Sites and some alien on them to drain fast . Then , i think he drew for a while while puting some small starship at bespin for a HUGE force drain of 1 . meanwhile I had put Tarkin on Table . I was going to stop drawing because he really was not a opposition . But he then deploy Luke EPP play clash of saber on Vader. Oh $%^&amp; . Where the hell is my crush the rebellion ??? In my deck probably ;) I was sweeting but then i notice I had a Japenes Ghyyk in my hand . He attack Tarkin , miss him , drew a 5 , so i was ok without playing ghyyk. My combo was not ready yet , so i kill ben. Then He Kill My jaba With Twash Khas. I Put U-3PO where jaba was . i could had track my shoking revelation easily to kill Twash , but i was not really in that game. so i drew till I had my combo. Then he Put Epp Luke In Front of vader :) exactly what i was waiting for. He Attack me . I dont Draw Batle destiny. Next Turn I put Djas Phur In Front of Ben, Echo War Room , Much Anger In Him and Responsability of command. It took me like 5 minutes to explain me what that thing do while he was complaning that HDADTJ sux. I put vader Somewere else to flip the objective. He Try To Kill Him and Succeed . Next Turn I deploy Vader Choke , ECC Ig-88, Zuckuss, ECC 4-Lom , i attack , choke someone , capture someone else , I drew A 7 and a 5 for batle destiny. 20 batle Damage . Much Anger Responsability of Command Finish him.<br/>
