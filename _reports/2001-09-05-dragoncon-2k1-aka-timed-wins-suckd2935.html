<br/>
So school starts up and I don&amp;#8217;t have too much time to mess with decks.  But I make a sweet DS Senator deck and Bastian sends me this wierdo Cheez Profit.  So I drive an hour and a half to Columbia and go 6-0 with Landon and Carmine.  The decks did pretty good and I like them both a bunch.  The profit wins games by a TON of force.  Im talking it won by 48, 43, and 30+.  Sure it wasnt serious competition but I am not gonna see any competition in Games 1 and 2 of DragonCon and if I win my first two by 30 and 40, Im set.  It will beat anyone rated under 1800s by over 30 and probably 40 if they don&amp;#8217;t know what they are doing.  The dark side was ok, but a couple days before DragonCon, Bastian wins Euro Continentals with a wacky Watto deck that hes posted.  And he gives it to me under the one condition that I dont lose with it.  So I go build it and test it against Carmine and Landon.  It seems solid and really fast too.  It beat HB and WYS so I figured that would be all I needed for DS.  As for LS, I made a few modifications to the Profit and it was ready to go.  Both decks win by a ton of force and in a 6-game tourney all I need is to be 5-1 with the highest differential to be in the final confrontation.  And considering I had the highest differential at the end of the tourny, even the only undefeated, I guess they do win by a lot.<br/>
<br/>
James Boyd, or JIMMMMYYYY, is the only guy thats coming up with me from Augusta.  We wake at 5 on Saturday morning and my parents drive us up since they wont let me drive in Atlanta traffic.  They drop us off at the Mariott at 8.  There happens to be one little problem.  The Open starts at 9, and the Badge registration line opens at 9 also!  Even though we get there an hour early, there is still a line to wait in.  But Jim Colson comes down and realizes the problem and tells all Wars players in line that they&amp;#8217;ll wait for us.  So we get our badges and I meat John and Mayne from Tennessee.  I play a fun game against Johns HBX and deploy the Executor for free, that was fun.  We get on this weird elevator that takes us up 17 levels after we miss our stop but I swear it wasn&amp;#8217;t the operators fault &amp;#61514;  It was an evil elevator, but it finally takes us down to the ballroom.  And after an hour of decklist checking due to some anonymous person writing Porn Star 3PO on their decklist, we start at 10.<br/>
<br/>
DECKS:  LS Profit with Odds and AFA.  2 characters with ability.  Hot deck, very solid.  Did I mention Don&amp;#8217;t do that Again suspends You Cant Hide Forever Combo?  &amp;#61514;<br/>
DS is speed watto.  Both decks from Bastian LOL!  First time in a while that Ive used two decks that arent mine in one tourny.  But I could care less if they win.  <br/>
My rating before entering is 2107.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  My Watto vs. Andy Talaga(1933) Cheese<br/>
He starts Hologameboard&amp;#8230;hmm.  Then he races and starts Battle Plan.  I take IAO/SP instead of Bad Feeling Have I unfortunately.  So first turn Televann comes out with S&amp;D to Mos Espa.  Put a card down to make him lose two force.  Now I figure its cheez and Im holding Barrier and Projective so I might as well risk the first turn S&amp;D.  His turn he gets 6, drops Obi.  I barrier, he cancels with combo card, I could sense with watto but its unlikely and I want to save it for his A Step Back ward anyway.  He spends last force to battle and I projective telepathy.  Maul is my only character and Ghhhk was my first race destiny stacked and I only play one so I cant MM for a ghhk.  This forces me on my turn to drop Maul, put a card down to make him lose 2, and battle Obi losing Televan, Maul, and my key card for his deck Search and Destroy.   This games is very slow because neither of us are doing damage.  He saves two every turn for my objective and then wins the race but gets no force because I started IAO/SP.  I force lightning his undercover Bothan spy.  He then puts a Projection of a Skywalker at Wattos Site and Mos Espa, and the Arena is the only place I can drain and Im not even draining their due to recurring EPP Lukes and Obis.  I am low on force and have a 5 and 6 tracked so I lose to I Did It and save some.  Sure enough, EPP Luke comes down to a lone Mara at the Arena.  I barrier and he saves his last two.  He spends his two to let me drop EPP Vader and then I pay 3 for 4-Lom.  I battle, blank lukes text, hit him with tracked destinies, and draw a Sense.  He loses Luke and 7 while I lose Vader.  Next turn another Luke comes down but because of bad destinies he only kills 4-LOM and Mara stays.  I drain, and recirculate.  He drops TK-422 to the Arena and now I have absolutely no way to damage him considering hes saving two a turn.  He puts Bothan Spy and EPP Obi to the Flagship Bridge.  But EPP Vader comes down again for free and hacks the Bothan and kills Obi with Attrition.  The game is at a stale mate and I have an AFA in my deck.  So I get all my bravery and courage together&amp;#8230;and drop my Ghhhk to his Holotable to drain him out!<br/>
<br/>
FW (+16)<br/>
Highs:  I made him spend 2 to deploy my Ghhhk.  LOL.<br/>
Lows:  Losing my Search and Destroy.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  My LS vs. Jason Hasis(2086) BHBM Ties and Mains<br/>
Man, it seems like I always get stiff pairings in the early games(refer to Atl DPC!).  He puts his starting hand down and uses Mob Points without looking at his hand.  Well Waklemui was in his starting hand so I verify his deck before the game begins.  I see a million Ties and all the Tie stuff so I am thinking drain race.  I look through a second time and realize I didnt see a single battleground system!  So he starts BHBM with the Anti-SAC card, IAO/SP, and MP/YCHF and Mara starts in the Chamber.  He activates, and I pull I Did It and say start the race.  He replies, you cant start the race on my turn.  What?  Of course I can because of Boonta Eve Podrace, but he wants to go ahead and check with the judges which is fine.  But the judges go ahead and the official rules and then come back and tell me I can start it so I do.  Jason was cool about it though and we get started but the ruling took about 1-2 minutes to get the judge over and then have him go find the ruling.  So he puts Emperor and Emps Power at the Throne Room, pulls Lightning, drops Waklemui and DS:2 DB, Mara gets her stick and moves outside.  He also stalled me with Sebulba and drew a 3.  On my turn, I pull Threepio to the AC, put Jedi Luke to Mara for 4(-2 from each objective).  Battle and draw a 5 to kill her, he loses to Emps Power but draws insignificantly so Mara goes down early while her husband stays and moves into the AC.  On his turn, Maul comes down with stick and Phantom Menace.  I tell him I wanted to draw race destiny in his control phase and that he jumped into his deploy phase, but he wont let me draw them.  So he battles and uses Emps Power to draw an extra, he misses the hack but draws high enough to take out look and moves Maul out for the drain of 3.  I cant find an EPP Obi for my life but Im alright, so I insert AFA and put Artoo out and move him in for A gift.  His turn I actually get to draw race destiny, I stack 2 5s and he stacks a 1.  He puts Lord Vader and stick at the Endor DB but Im not too sure why.  So I drop Luke into the AC to stop Your Destiny, and I also moved Artoo out to block the drain since someone cant draw their Lost in the Wildernesses OR the DDTAgain to start the inserts.  So I save 6 on his turn for the race retrieval.  He snipers Artoo, and drains for 3 and 2 with Maul and Vader.  I lose 5 and stack my race destinies.  SO here comes all the ugliness.  I win the race and in the 6 cards I retrieve both of my Lost in the Wildernesses are there and threepio is on table.  SO I count my reserve, and count where they were in the 6 force retrieved, but I forgot to place my race destinies on top.  So I do that and recount so I can track them into my hand.  So Ive said /The race completes/ but I didnt actually say, /LOSE 6/ so he doesn&amp;#8217;t lose 6 to the race since I was so busy tracking I didnt notice.  I figured he had lost it and didn&amp;#8217;t actually check the cards because I knew the Wildernesses would be game breaking as they were.  So it takes me two turns to actiavate 8 a turn, plus 4 threepios, plus a lose of 5 from the reserve, and I FINALLY get to my 2 Lost in the Wildernesses.  Maul goes missing at JP and Vader goes missing at Endor DB.  He is deploying Ties to waklemui to retrieve force but putting out more ties in the process so its equaling out.  But he plays Short Range to retrieve 6 and this game is drawing near time.  So here is the situation.  He isnt doing any more damage to me.  Obi killed Mara who was about to find Maul.  And Jedi Luke comes down and I spend ten to retrieve ten and then spend 4 to retrieve 4 with I did It.  I am doing 2 Profit with Han at AC and Luke at JP while spending 6 to drain for 2 a turn.  He has AFA and Odds in deck and DDTA is suspending YCHF.  He is stalling like Ive never scene, but he could care less.  I tell him it wont affect him whether he gets a Timed Loss or Full Loss, but he assures me he understands the process and just flat out doesnt want me to get the full win.  Worst of all, Jim Colson is standing right besides us.  Jason preceeds to move the Emperor back and forth from the Throne Room to the DS:2 DB, and then he pulls Force Lightning.  Then he decides he wants to put it back with Drop, then as soon as he recirculates, he pulls it again.  He then shuffles his deck very, very well and offers me a cut which I continually decline.  There is 60 seconds on the clock, adequate time Im telling myself.  I activate and must finish my turn quickly so he can start his turn and I can have another turn to drain him out.  So I activate my 7, do 2 profit damage which he loses, I then spend 6 to drain for 2.  I play OOC/TT too which he replies, that requires shuffling.  And I kid you not when I say that Jason is a darn good shuffler.  I mean he took that lost Pile and shuffled it like Ive never seen a lost Pile shuffled.  As a matter of fact, it took him a good 15-30 seconds to shuffle it, let me pick a card, offer me the cut again as if I would, and then put it back into place.  And wouldnt ya know, time is called.  @#$%!  Sure I coulda not played the OOC but neither did he have to shuffle for an that long.  I have 29 to his 3, one more turn it woulda been over, that sucks.<br/>
<br/>
TW(+29)<br/>
So I talk to Jim Colson for like 10 minutes and he says he cant do anything because Jason was actually doing legal actions and BLA BLA BLA.  I am so fed up I just want to drop.  Now Jason, I know my LS deck was cheesy as heck, and I hope I haven&amp;#8217;t offended you (you do happen to be twice my size anyway), but I just think that was extremely, incredibly, unbelievably unsportsmanlike of you.  I also think the rulings call in the beginning was blatantly obvious due to the text on Boonta Eve Podrace.  But no time extension was given, and Mr. Colson didn&amp;#8217;t see anything wrong, so I get my first &amp;#8220;lose&amp;#8221; and now must win my next 4 games to get into the final.  Differential no longer matters due to my timed win and differential was exactly what I centered my decks around(!!!).  I was counting on getting 5 full wins by a ton, and then losing a game by whatever and getting into the final. Enough venting, on to game 3.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  My DS vs. Sean Morrison(1677) WYS Racing<br/>
OH dear goodness!  This is the deck everyone tells me I should lose too.  As if I&amp;#8217;m scared, I am ready to beat the first WYS with this and Ive got a great chance.  I get a good hand too.  So he starts &amp;#8220;Podrace Prep&amp;#8221; so I choose IAO/SP as my effect for the second time today.  I do all the standard stuff, Drop watto from reserve, Televan to Mos Espa, Search and Destroy comes down too.  He loses two to my Objective and 1 to S&amp;D before he even starts.  He puts Wedge in Ship at Kessel with ITTL and loses one to Search and Destroy, he draws for his racing interrupts.  He plays A Step Backwards but its ok cuz Im not even going to attempt to win the race this game.  He spends 2 and I put Chimaera at Tatooine with Maul in it.  Emperor goes to Cantina and I pull Lightning, move Chimaera to Kessel and he loses yet another to S&amp;D.  He puts 2 RFCs at Wattos Hutt for 10 force&amp;#8230;and battles.  I tell him I have some actions.  I play Wattos Chance Cube and I am so freaking lucky to draw even.  I point out to him the text on the location and he is kind of unhappy.  I draw my destiny, 6 and 4.  So both RFCs die and he loses another to Search And Destroy.  At this point, I have complete control of the board.  I drain 5 total, and and draw some good cards but not too many because I want this game by over 30.  He loses another to Search and Destroy.  He puts Mirax in ship at Tatooine, but still isnt flipped.  He saves to which he spends for me to put Zuckuss in MH at Tatooine.  I add 4-LOM as Passenger and then Dr.E/Ponda Baba as pilot.  She dies and he loses some more to S&amp;D.  He then pays another 10 to put 2 RFCs in the cantina and battles.  Unfortunately, he hasn&amp;#8217;t thought forward to what will be left after the battle.  He draws a 5 and 6 so I lose the Emperor while he is only alowwed to lose one RFC due to my battle destiny.  So next turn EPP Vader comes down and he loses the RFC and 8.  He wins the race but cant pay to retrieve and I lose 6 cards from hand.  I control both systems, Cantina, Mos Espa, and Wattos Junkyard and drain him out.  <br/>
<br/>
FW+33<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Proving WYS doesnt beat my Watto.<br/>
Lows:  None, differential coulda been higher.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LS vs. Dustin Cravens(1654) Space ISB<br/>
There is no need to tell you what we started except he didnt start Insert defense.  First turn out comes to ORS to Exe. DB.  I drop Jedi Luke to AC and Artoo to JP and insert AFA and Odds.  His turn it pops and he loses 8.  This game was flat out drain race which is very easy for my deck to win.  But I did a couple things to ensure that I won it.  First, Artoo Doubled Agented the Undercover Arica he started.  Second and most critical, 5D6-RA7 comes down to JP to reduce all my drains to nothing.  But then I lost In the Wilderness my own drain and make her missing.  I win the race and get use I did It to get back 4.  He loses a ton of cards to the inserts and there were no battles.  <br/>
<br/>
FW+41<br/>
Highs:  Counting his power in space a couple times &amp;#61514;  At the end of the game he had 3 ORS and Merrejk on Executor and Conquest with Piett AND Thrawn.  Needless to say I dont play ships.<br/>
Lows:  I hate U-3PO.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My DS vs. Ray Franks(1893) Profit Scouts<br/>
I start racing and he says he has no racer so I start the box for the first time today, yay!  He starts Profit so I get Mara and Dr.E Combo out for free.  His effects were Insurrection combo, Stagin Areas combo, and Strike Planning.  My turn, I put Watto out, put somebody at Mos Espa, give Mara her stick, make him lose 2, and move Mara out.  That&amp;#8217;s a pretty darn good first turn if you ask me.  So he comes to Mos Espa with Lando w/ Axe and Junkin neither of which I barrier.  He battles and I lose my dude and he plays Insertion Planning and loses noone.  On my turn I drop Xizor down and battle.  He misses the exclusion and he loses Junkin to attrition while I lose nothing and hold on to my barrier.  I move Dr.E Combo out since he is getting a good deal of force now and move Mara in and draw up to some goodies.  He puts down a scout at JP and moves Lando there in front of my Dr.E combo.  He spends two and I am able to drop like EPP Fett, Mighty Jabba, and 4-LOM for 5 force.  I battle and hit and operate on Lando.  The remaining scene is like the scout and 7 or 8.  His only chance is to free Han so I move Jabba, Fett, and 4-LOM into there while Empy and Watto keep me flipped.  With Chance Cube, Force Lightning, Barrier, and EPP Vader there is absolutely nothing he can do to unflip me.  Unfortunately, he draws up the turn before I can finish my Boxed Race.  I had To wait a turn for the Aim High attatched to his Insurrection and then he drew up.  Still won by a good bit.<br/>
<br/>
FW+36<br/>
<br/>
Praskac stalls out Andy McClure so I get to play Andy.  We both have one timed win now and whoever wins goes to the final with Praskac.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My LS vs. Andy Mcclures(1996) Maul Senate<br/>
So this is a good match-up for me.  He forgets to start 2 aliens and unfortunately I stick him to it.  We had already drawn our hands but I wish I hadnt as I look back on it.  I drop Threepio first turn to JP and then Jedi Luke to AC, insert both inserts.  He activates all and nothing pops(!!).  He draws some and plays Squabbeling on his and my turn to get Lott Dod and Orn Free Ta.  So I pull Artoo to JP and draw some to get Lost in the Wilderness but cant fdind an EPP Obi to save my life.  He activates a whopping 4, nothing pops, Maul comes down with his stick and moves to Mos Espa DB and Lott Dod and Orn Free go to the Senate to give him a decent insert total.  So I am thinking of what to do and decide to wait out for a little bit and I draw a ton to try and get Obi but he still aint there.  Artoo moves into AC and I play A Gift.  So listen to this.  He activates both inserts and loses 8 to the Odds but then comes his Control Phase.  Either he forgot to drain at his DB or didnt on purpose, but Maul doesnt drain so I cant make him missing.  Instead, the exact opposite of what I wanted to happen, happens.  He Elises from the DB infront of Luke.  He battles to satisfy AFA and I play It&amp;#8217;s a Trap.  I swear if I had had an Obi right now I coulda won it but I dont.  So I run look outside but he doesnt follow.  DDTA suspends his YCHF until he finally puts Stinger alone at Carida and starts draining for 3 a turn there with his Politics and 1 in the senate cuz Tikkes comes down the turn after I get Honor.  I win the race and track some destinies, Obi comes down to Maul so I can kill Maul with my my tracked destinies and move Luke in to free HAN!  But then he barriers Obi and I cant believe it.  I move Luke inside and wait.  He battles and hits Obi and draws enough to Kill luke while I hack Maul with a 9 and draw enough to will one of his other characters.  But he puts EPP Vader in their his following turn so I still don&amp;#8217;t have a chance to free Han.  He is still draining for 4 a turn so hes catching up with me in life force.  EPP Obi killes Vader and I play my 2nd Resilience.  On his turn, he plays down Mara, P-59 and 60 and I cant believe my eyes.  This game is going downhill and very fast too.  I continue inserting AFA so he is losing a little to that every now and then, but besides that I have no damage source while he continues to put his senators back with his objective and then pulling them with Lott Dod and draining for 4.  So I bring down Jedi Luke with Lightsaber to the AC to meet with Mara and both battle droids.  Im Immune less than 7 and have a defense value of 7.  I battle but dont have a TTFC to stop his droid from firing.  He draws Edcel which is a 6, +1 from the droid, and Luke is &amp;#8211;1 from YCHF!  That stupid bastard(radio edit) of a droid!  DANG IT!  Curse ALL P-59s and 60s all over this cursed world.  So I hack up Mara, and draw destiny to kill P-59 but I lose Luke.  A well fought battle, but in the end P-60 reignes supreme and I never free the poor little popsicle.<br/>
<br/>
FL-8<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Odds for 8 on turn 3.<br/>
Lows:  If he had drained with Maul I woulda won, If he had not had so many characters to fight with I woulda won.  If he hadnt had the Senator put back I woulda won since Luke woulda lived.<br/>
<br/>
Andy goes into the final and I think he won it over Praskac.  I get fifth place so at least I get glass.  I think the top 8 were as follows:<br/>
8th-Chris Gogolen(oh yeah, Gemme, you better back off da boy! J/k)<br/>
7th-Andy Talaga<br/>
6th-Will Raiman<br/>
5th-Paul &amp;#8220;If I had an extra Victory Point I woulda been 2nd&amp;#8221; Myers (9+147)<br/>
4th-Jason Hasis<br/>
3rd-Brian Rippetoe(10+98)<br/>
2nd-Chris &amp;#8220;Why cant they ever get my name right!&amp;#8221; Prisksnatch (10+104)<br/>
1st-Andy Mcclure(11+not sure, I think I was above it though)<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
