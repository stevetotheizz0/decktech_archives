<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">here we are in milwaukee, and i am playtesting for the last<br/>
time before the qualifier and you know what my deck sucks so <br/>
in desperation i turn to my good buddy yannick and he shows me<br/>
is light side ,witch after i see him play against gary, decide<br/>
to build a similiar one minus a few card of is deck and for my <br/>
dark side well gary just looks at it well show me the error <br/>
i was doing when playing it and made me change a few card <br/>
that help a lot.<br/>
<br/>
so my light side was: mind what you have learned( direct damage)<br/>
and dark side was: bring him before me.<br/>
<br/>
now on to the tournament <br/>
day 1<br/>
<br/>
well for day1 i didn't keep track of my opponent i know i played<br/>
great player such as martin raveling, jim li, todd rowe and others<br/>
but in the end of a 8 match tournament i standed undefeated<br/>
at 8-0 + 132. Wich is my very best EVER, now i am qualified <br/>
what a relief.<br/>
<br/>
day 2 annouce to be a lot more tougher than yesterday we are <br/>
about 50 and you can see only top player are here. on to the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
my light side vs eric hunter rop's<br/>
<br/>
Well i played against 1 ralltir ops before this match and i won but eric is<br/>
a mutch better player than the other guys. But with afa and my 2 <br/>
presence of the skywalker on table + uncontrolled fury are just enough <br/>
to give me the win.<br/>
FW 2(+6)<br/>
<br/>
dark vs todd rowe <br/>
i think if i remember correctly he started only rendez-vous point <br/>
and 3 effect no hidden base so thats a relief well basicly <br/>
i set up search and destro by turn 3 with vader at a spaceport<br/>
docking bay and mara + emperor at the endor docking bay.<br/>
FW 4(+26)<br/>
<br/>
light vs ray bordier bring him<br/>
Now ray is a very good player and i must say that it is fun to play <br/>
against him. In this game ray made one heck of a masterfull move <br/>
i gave him luke to vader on his turn he moves vader to the docking <br/>
bay and at the beggining of is control phase he rise my friend vader<br/>
and frees luke now at this point i am thinking he fears a beatdown <br/>
since i got 10 card in hand + 10 card already activated, so on my turn<br/>
i do like everybody and drain he play lost in the wilderness<br/>
and the only thing i can do is watch my luke go missing. basicly <br/>
after that vader came with a bunch on people made me lose 3 <br/>
to your destiny and he won<br/>
FL 4(+2)<br/>
<br/>
dark vs geoff snider profit <br/>
i dont really remember this game but i know that search and destroy <br/>
was set up quickly and we battle it out on tatooine.<br/>
FW 6(+20)<br/>
<br/>
now at that point i am 3-1 and this good because i am at the<br/>
4th table.<br/>
<br/>
light vs hayes hunter bring him<br/>
hayes is a very good player we start of like usual for a few turn tough <br/>
hayes only draws and like on the 4th turn all at once deploys<br/>
cc : downtown plaza, presence of the force, vader, is lightsaber<br/>
and some scrub. this is not good i only have obi-wan with lightsaber in hand<br/>
so i gave luke to vader drew and played it could be worst when i had it<br/>
now at that point i only got one afa and already lost 1st test <br/>
ok i am in trouble so i finaly send obi with leia and manage to clear <br/>
the site after a couple of turn but hayes just comes back with <br/>
tatooine cantina, vader, mara and their lightsaber and that was just <br/>
enough to give him the win.<br/>
FL 6(+4)<br/>
<br/>
dark versus erick peterson<br/>
he starts yoda's hut + 3 effect and thats ok by me. so i <br/>
start setting search and destroy but he decide to come and see<br/>
me with ben kenobi (deployed at tatooine docking bay) and 2 scrub <br/>
ok next turn vader and his lightsaber comes to is site circle <br/>
ben slash one of the 2 scrub and he lost some force to that +<br/>
search was completed and that basicly ended the game.<br/>
FW 8(+26)<br/>
<br/>
so in the end my dark side never lost i went 12-2 at gencon <br/>
got a lot of rating since i am at 1776 of rating and finish <br/>
9th in day 2 i would say i had a good week-end. well i am <br/>
sure to see every one a deciphercon and sorry if i made <br/>
mistake with the grammar.   </font></td>
