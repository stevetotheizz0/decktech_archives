<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hello everyone I hope you enjoy my tournament report.<br/>
<br/>
Pre tournament- Well uh I guess it all starts at the last tournament which is a jr. so I get second and I think some guy cheated, but who knows, he got the same hand in both his dark side games, but it doesn*t matter all that much because I only lose to him by six so that*s cool. So I go home and start composing my 60 card decks. I want to play some Mi*yoom or whatever BHBM, but I can only find about 2 of mine, so I ditch that idea, and just go with a plain old BHBM which you can read right here (the next 3 pages are just my decks so if you don*t want to read it just skip down).<br/>

So my decks are pretty cool. So Saturday morning I wake up, look over my decks again, and then I start calling some friends. None can come. So my dad drives me over to Durham (30 min. drive), and gives me 20 dollars to spend on lunch and stuff. So I go into the store and there*s like two people there so I hang out there some, and look at all the stuff they have for sale, and buy my entry fee. I see some people I haven*t seen at tournaments before, so that*s cool and stuff. So its like 11:30 the tournaments scheduled to start at 11, but there*s no TD. Finally Don, the TD calls, and says he*s having car trouble, so he gets Henry, and Jason to run the tournament. So we get the pairings:<br/>
<br/>
Game 1- My dark vs. Logon Swanek*s Hidden Base, with Nebulon B-Frigs, and Guns<br/>
<br/>
I start the regular stuff with OE being the 3rd effect, he starts that weapon forfeiter thing squad ass. and something else, and HB being his Objective. My first turn I deploy Palpy to my d*2DB and say your go. He*s like your going to win so he draws up. I get Endor DB with Lord Vader there. He deploys some systems and gets General Calrissian in his ship out and says my go. He loses to Your Destiny, so I get the spaceport DB, and get either Janus or Sim there and drain with Palpy. The next few turns are really uneventful, I keep reminding him to drain (its his first tourney) and he keeps losing to YD. I attack him with 2 Drednoughts, and the Dominator, he loses both the ship and Lando, no overflow. I drain him and your destiny him. And after a while he finds his 5th system to flip his obj. By this time he has a TK-422 at Vader*s place, it doesn*t really matter to me. He can*t really recover from the damage I did before YD wins the game for me. FW 2 (+32)<br/>
<br/>
Good- I win by 32 J<br/>
<br/>
Bad- Now, it is my destiny to play someone good.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My light vs. John Irving*s Maul Mains<br/>
<br/>
I start the normal stuff, he starts the Maul Mains stuff (Combat Rediness, Maul*s Hut, Jabba*s Palace). I*m sorta scared so I ask him his rating to see if he*s as good as what I expected, he says 1580, that*s good, only a little better than mine. So he pulls some JP sites on his first turn, and says my go. So I pull Qui once per game from reserve deck with outskirts text, and move him over to the station. He pulls Mara once per game with AC text puts a POTF there, and says my go. So I Naburn over, and put a lightsaber Proficiency on him, and battle. I think he loses just Mara and her stick. He takes the drain of 4 or 5 there for a turn or two. It looks like he*s saving up so I play goo ney tay, he looks pretty pissed off, but he still attacks Qui Gon, and a Chewie that I had deployed there. A Vader gets Clashed, so its Aurra, Tarkin, and Xizor vs. my Chewie and boosted Qui Gon. I swing and hit someone. We draw destiny. I smoke screen. Everyone dies except Qui Gon, and Vader. I*m not too sure on what happens next but what I remember is deploying Jedi Luke, and making his Vader lost. He deploys a Maul at Maul*s Hut, by this time I have Jedi Luke, two scrubs at the palace. So he moves his Maul over. I naburn Qui over, battle, hit Maul, draw some pretty high destiny, and make him lose 27 force of battle damage. I drain some and that*s game. FW +40  4(+72)<br/>
Good- John was pretty cool and had just moved here from Texas, I*m sorry I had to beat him by that much.<br/>
<br/>
Bad- None.<br/>
<br/>
So its lunch break, I get some very, very yummy shrimp stuff at a nearby Chinese place. I go back in the shop and it seems as though I*m in first, but I*ll have to play Henry , who is the temporary TD, and a very strong player , so that sort of sucks. So Don (the original TD) gets back and stuff.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My LS vs. Henry Jicha*s Retardasaurus Rex ISB Space.<br/>
Auto win for him I have like 5 ships and there in there for TIE protection, so I just do the regular stuff. On his turn he deploys like all his systems (wow) so he gets some drain with Cheireno or whatever, in space, and starts stopping my drains with Rim Scouts on Bargaining Table. He*s built up a fleet at Endor DB, so I go attack him with my Jedi Luke, and some other people. Nothing really happens, I get rid of a few Rim Scouts. Luckily for me, in my opening hand I got 2 of my ships and home one war room. So I put Chewbacca, Protector, there and Artoo in Red 5 with the avenger, and Home One (deploy &amp;#8211;5). So I battle, he commands, and I lose Artoo in his ship. On his turn he Lat. Damages it (doh!)  and deploys some SD, he commands. I lose the battle by 26. That*s pretty much game. FL &amp;#8211;23 4(+49)<br/>
<br/>
Good- None really.<br/>
<br/>
Bad- Getting killed by 26.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My DS vs. Henry Jicha*s WYS Racing.<br/>
This game was totally one sided. He wins the race by about 5. He gets a steady drain at Kessel, and deploys Jedi Luke at the Cantina with his stick for a drain of 3. I have Palpy and Sim at the DB, he deploys a Projection, shoot. I try to attack his Jedi Luke, but he keeps swinging threw my guys, and killing the rest with battle damage. So pretty much my ground is killed. So I attack him with a pair of Drednoughts, one gets killed the other dies the next turn by about 10. That*s pretty much game. FL &amp;#8211;31  4(+18)<br/>
<br/>
Good- None.<br/>
<br/>
Bad- A lot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 My LS vs. Carson Swanek*s Court Capture.<br/>
He starts regular Court Stuff. And I start the regular stuff. I think I kill his Mara with Qui Gon, just like game 2. So he builds up an army at the AC, I get armies at the other Tat. Sites, and start Harc Seffing the drain. He keeps on saying how much he*s losing and stuff, and eventully, he Elis Helrots over to some site and beats me down in a battle with 8 or so overflow.  I pretty much drain him out from there. FW +18 6(+36)<br/>
Good- Winning so this means I*ll go at least 3-3.<br/>
<br/>
Bad- Getting beatdown by 8 or something.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 My DS vs. Eddie Brown*s Blow Away Bunker, no race RST.<br/>
My 3rd effect was secret plans I*m pretty sure, so on my first turn I get Palpy to the Landing site and say your go. He*s sorta being force choked, so he just saves up. I drain him some and get Mara with her stick there. Next turn he sets up close air support with only Tala 2. I drain and say your go. So he brings down Orri and Luke with Stick, Luke with Stick is FOIL you are beatened. So Orri draws 3 destiny one to power and 2 battle, the totals 5 or something. I think I lose Palpy. He stacks one. On my turn I bring out Zukuss In Mist Hunter, and Lat. Damage on Tala 2. I win the battle by like 8 overflow. So he stacks one and loses 8. Next turn he saves up. I bring down Guri at the landing site. He puts EPP Leia with Luke and battles. He draws one destiny and one to power. He hits both of my dudes, I hit one of his. He stacks one on IR, and the site is cleared. He takes over Endor, and I start space draining. I get some dudes out and start draining on the ground. He blows up the bunker, but its to late I drain him out. FW +22  8 (+58)<br/>
<br/>
Good-It was a cool game.<br/>
<br/>
Bad- nothing really.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I come in third out of 17, or something, this was probably my best sanctioned tournament finish ever. Now my friend is insisting that I write my *stats*, they were 8 (+58), happy Lowell???<br/>
