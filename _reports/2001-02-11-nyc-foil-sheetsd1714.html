<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">     All week I had been trying to find a way to get into NYC for this decipher sponsored tournament for foil sheets. Well finally on Thursday Night I get a call from Johnny "Johnny Vegas" Riviera and he says he can hook me up with a ride. I had playtested with my bro Mike "Deck" Gemme and was very confident that my dark deck would go 2-0 cuz this thing is a machine, i was worried about my light though but I figuered that if i played a MKOS or Court deck I would win. We leave my house around 630 and have no problems getting into the city excepot for the fact we took a right instead of a left somewhere and ended going through an tunnel and getting hit by the tolls for like 7 dollars. We arrrive there and have to wait about ten minutes for the place to open. I meet up with my friend Mike and talk to team albany and everyone, the tournament starts on time.<br/>
<br/>
Decks: Dark i was playing Huntdown with like 12 sevens and 6 sixes. Light i was playing Droid tech with How did we get into this mess and beats.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My light vs. Some guys BHBM ties.<br/>
     Well i get pretty decent hand and im not sure what to expect from him since when he searched for the emperors power i saw he was playing all ties, i figuered this was the one deck i would loose to. I get all of my twixes out early with the help of How did we get into this mess and i was stacking my hand to beat up on his emperor. I finally gahter the forces to beat up the emperor and he looses the battle big and has to loose like 30 force, from their on out i just drained him for 4 and he was done. Wasnt really much to say about this game i set up fast he did not and i just beat the living hell out of him. So after this game im pretty confident with my light.<br/>
<br/>
Win by 36 2(+36)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My Dark vs Andy Klema WYS<br/>
     This is one of the game i did not want to play only becuase Andy and we chill and were from the same region so basically we know each others decks and we have layed before. Well i get a normal set up on the third turn or so i get Vader, lightsaber, tarkin to his Db and and start ot drain and hit him with visage. He doesnt feel like taking the Visage damge anymore and he deploy Jedi KNight luke and his lightsaber to the Cantina. On my turn i move the guys over and wait to see if he is going to battle me, he does not so i just do a blind duel, he immediatly says F*ck since he has no dueling cards and i have one anyways I draw a 7,6,3 and he draws a 6,0 form their on out he wasnt ever able to control my drains on the ground and my visage damage.<br/>
<br/>
Win By 30 4(+66)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My lgiht verse Brian Twiggs Huntdown Beats<br/>
     We both knew at the beginning of this game whoever one would go on to win the foil sheets and the tournament. I was getting worried becuase i was hoping that i would have to have played him with my dark instead of my light, well it didnt quite happen that way. Well to say he gets a really good start and drops mara with saber down to my twix. My hand is @#$% i odnt get a single one of my 6 how did we get into this mess or a singe one of my 7 twixes also igot one charachter in my hand epp obi, so rihgt about now im getting real worried. On my tturn i deploy R2 and hope to  draw some locations. I dont get anything except for a destiny adder. On his next turn he deploys vader, so i have to start to loose to visage. Im getting pissed cuz im loosing like 5  turn to his drains and visage so i decide to make a hit and run against vader and that doesnt work he just barriers it and on his turn he beats obi down for a lot. That was preyy much game becuase, he jsut drained me out. <br/>
<br/>
Loss by like 20 or something I odnt remember.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 my Dark vs Some guys Hidden base. I st up with vader and such real soon and im thinking i have this game since i am drainin for 2 a turn and i have all of my starships in my hand, needless to say he drops boush and since i dont have any spie protection i wont be draining him for anything at my db. So i set up Zuckess with Mara and Thrawn on the Chimeara and start draining and beating him up in space. He couldnt hanbdle the 14 in attrition after the battles so i made short time of his starships. I set up Search and Destory and he looses 2 every turn from their on out and that finishes hime over.<br/>
<br/>
Won by like 26 i think.<br/>
<br/>
Well I end up getting third and im pretty pissed that out of the relfections sheets they gave the top 2 and gave the other ones out at random. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
     I ended up doing the Booster Draft later on that night and we will just say i got both a Lord Vader and an emperor past to me and my friend passed a Luke Skywalke to someone and we all sat att he same table, so with 2 Urs in my deck and some pretty decent other stuff i think i will be doing good and everyone is telling me ohh you should win the turnament and such well i would have if i had a tiny bit of space i had gotten absolutely no starships and Brian twiggs deck basically drainied in space form like turn 2 or 5, and i also Lost to Aaron Kringly’s (Sorry if I spelled it wrong) baragwin deck lets just say this deck was a total lock almost as good as a regular deck and he ended up winning that.<br/>
<br/>
     At around 1030 we decide we have to go and start to head back to MA well when we get into the car we realize that we cant backtrack our directioans and that we fgorgot to print up directions on how to get back so we get lost in the city and have no clue where we are going until we hit like another 3 tolss that cost 3.50 each,and wee ask for direction so we are almost out of the city and we are empty on gass so we are getting pretty worried cuz I really didnt want to get stuck in the Bronx with no gas, we luckily find a gas station as we are practically empty, and we finally find the way home and around 2 and a half hours into our drive we hit a @#$%ing Dear, lukilly we swerved out of the way in time and just took out one of its legs so if anyone sees a dying deer on the high way that was us. I finally get home around 2 and i got to bed. The day was Fun and there new tatooine cards were great.<br/>
