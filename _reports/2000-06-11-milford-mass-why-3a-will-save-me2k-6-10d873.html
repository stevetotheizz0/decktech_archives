<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">helo again, it is i, erich hunter(mass state champ) reporting on why 3A will "unscrub" me. ever since states i haven't done better then 4-2 and i have had several 3-3 tournaments, bahhhhh...... this was where the boston grand slam was and i scrubed out there. plus the pizza was crappy there too. but no wi'm here again taking 1 solid dark deck and one hanky-panky light deck. <br/>
the night before i had made like 4 different light decks, one was a regular fake hb, one was a ray bordier pa winning style hb, one was a degabah x-wings, and finaly a trm style hb deck. as you can see i'm sick of trm and want something new. so i made these decks and played against my bro(hayes hunter) and i beaten horible, so thingts were bad. so i put away my light decks for a while and worked on my dark. from talking to mike "deck" Gemme and several other people i desided rops was the way to go. so i played aginst my bro's super falcons deck the projectioned 2 of my sites and what not, but i still won by 20 or so. so i was happy with that. after that i went out with my friends to a tramopoline and was on that for a while. so i got back and looked at the deck i had built for light side, the ray bordiers style hb. i was like hmmmmmm..... this one works better then the others so i'll play that. so i go to sleep aroung 11(wowa, real late eh? well it is for me! i'm 12)<br/>
<br/>
So i wake up and i feel like some guy after being in a crazed rage(well i wasn't aware of the feeling at the time), so i did a last minute change to my light which was add the super falcon, so i'm set and we head off to milford.<br/>
<br/>
i get there and see the regular crowd, some notables are brian cyzenski(N.H. state champ), hayes hunter, and steve beroni who beat steve brenston last week. well i sign up and go get some grub. i go upstairs and get pizza. i know i said the pizza sucked befor but i notieced it was a different color so i got in anyway. what do you know! it taste good. so onto the games.<br/>
<br/>
game 1 against mike Gemme toshe mains with many a 5. vs. my rops<br/>
<br/>
well i start and have 4 locations in my starting hand. booyah! well i deploy the death star, a twix , a &lt;&gt; site, and an ozel to the swamp. he activates and draws. i drain and draw. he deploys liea epp to toshe and he draws, i monkok used. next turn i deploy iao and flip my objective. he puts ben down and saber and wege to toshe station and draws. so meanwhile i have tempest outs and have been searcing for  cards. he nabruns them over to the forest and let's me go. i move them to the desert and let him go. he follows to the desert and let's me go. i deploy sandwhirl, so now leia, tawass khaa, wedge, and ben are missing. that's preety much game and i hjust drain him out.2+20<br/>
<br/>
hl:sandwhirl rocks!<br/>
ll: none really, or atleast none for me.<br/>
<br/>
game 2 against paul laudenbahch(sp?)'s tropper this deal.<br/>
i start with haven on rp, he starts bad feeling.he puts down 2 troopers and let's me go. well i start by deploying melas to onw of them and battle, he plays stunning leader and let's me go.he drains and puts down 2 more troopers so he has 2 at each site. i activate a lot and put down obi and ormarko and batle, swing hit, he loses them and 10. next turn i organized attack for 2 red squadron x's and 1 glod squad y. i deply them and move the 2 x's to bespin and 2 y's to tatioone and let him go.he deploys ds what ever in obsidinan 1 and zuckuss and ship against my 2 x's.  he batles and i organized attack he draws a 0. so i'm 12 to his 8, he loses 4 force. from here on it's a blur but i do remember me moving orimarko alone to a site and losing 17 from batle gamage. i drain him out. 4+28<br/>
<br/>
hl: my deck wokring like it's supposed to by getting 2 squadron ships a sytem to drain at.<br/>
ll:my scrubish move of moving orimarko over<br/>
<br/>
game 3 Steve beroni(sp?)'s HDATJ with 20 7's and counter asualt.<br/>
for the first couple turns of the game steve drew cards, well actualy he drew untill he had a hand of like 30, man oh man, why don't i play with grimtash? well anyway i start off with goo ney tay. he security percautions. well i get out my sytems and what not, but i lost my hidden base from visage...... that would be one reason i didn't win. i put down ships to the systems and have a comfeterble average drain of 2. eventualy though he gets a batle ground site and vader to it. also he's been looking for a reacter terminal to put down every 7 in his hand. so i start to spread out in space to drain and i put down obi to where choke vader is along with orimarko. i batle and swing and miss, he chokes orimarko, i draw low. bahhhh i forgot to play glancing blow to make him lose vader cause i was holding noble sacrifice and i had COK out. well from then on he drains i drain and i make atempts at vader with luke and obi. however he eventualy gets his reacter terminal down and puts down all his 7's, that's preety much game cause from there he counter asualts me/drains me to death. 4 +11<br/>
<br/>
hL: a good start but if i had a grimtash this game would of been different.<br/>
LL: it wasn't that fun of a game, plus i kinda acted like a sore loser cause i've been scrubing to much recently.<br/>
<br/>
well after this me, steve b, and mike g go out to lucnh. we end up going to a crappy chinese reasturant. i get the pork fried rice, bonless pork, beef and broccili, and chicken fingaers meal. the both get some chiken low main or whatever. So we talkin and mike says he got layed 9 times in the last 2 days by his girlfriend, then they both pretend there gay and what not. so i fealing a little out of place, but it was funny. so steve and i start @#$%en aat how the chinese food sucks and whatnot, but mike said "hey it wasn't that bad." right...... well we make it back but steve and i feel the need to take a craper cause the chinese food sucked. so we come back just in time for the next round.<br/>
<br/>
game 4 hayes hunters trm god luck draw deck.<br/>
well i have horible luck, and he has 3 twixes out 2nd turn and i have 2 &lt;&gt; after like 5 turns. i don't remember much but he basicly out activated me 17-8. i couldn't do anything, but when i took out some of his mains he would savrip, sooo things are as the french would say, "bad."4(-11)<br/>
<br/>
hL: laying the smacketh 21-6 on obi-wan.<br/>
LL: him savriping the damage. =(<br/>
<br/>
game 5 michael "rayc" Hawley's toshe mains.<br/>
i stat off drawing for 2 turns while he draws to. i get one twix out and put down a 2/2 guy at the swamp and drew up. he put ben down for 4 to the hut and moved him to the toshe station. i drain and flip using 2 at-st piolits and 1 2/2 guy. he then nabruns ben over and puts twass down to battle my guy at the swamp, i ghhhk. he thens flip my objective back. i put down tempest 1 to where my 2 guys are and let him go. we just trade drains for a couple turns as he makes a presence on ralitiir the sytem and i draw some at-st's. i on my turn i sandwhirl tawass and ben and flip my objective. we fight in space but he miscounts or i make him sac something to not draw his 5. eventualy he runs away with only gold leader in gold 1 to death star, i follow him and put batle order out and deploy kashyyk and a dreadnaught. he has 2 drains going on for 1 while i have 4 drains of 1 and ocasionaly a drain of 2 at kashyyk. finaly he get taintive to where my dreadnaught is and let's me go. i put down ds-3 and the bus to batle. i make him lose the tantive and 3. from there it's a drain race which i eventualy win. 6(-2)<br/>
<br/>
game 6 aginst michael hawley's HDADTJ non-deuing.<br/>
i don't remember too much from this one so bear with me.i do my start and get a couple pings against him while he makes a batle ground by putting presence on the death star war room, then deploying vader/tarkin to it. i get a quick flip and i deploy obi and orimarko to the wr. i batle, he cancels a destiny so i miss tarkin but i draw 2 destiny but he only loses tarkin. from there he gets my objective 2nd try and puts down ozel, i noble sacrifice leia to lose only 1 card from him probing me(he had security percauions) from there i run away from him n space while he tracks a 6 to capture obi. he drains/visage me out. 6(-10)<br/>
<br/>
hL: a great game. i know that my deck lost me that game, so i know the 3a will bring new decks that will save me.<br/>
LL: i ended up 3-3 =(<br/>
