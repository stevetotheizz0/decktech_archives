<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I was playing a Dueling Hunt Down for dark, and a Quiet Mining Colony for Light.<br/>
<br/>
The tournament started at 12.  This was the first time I had ever played at this shop, and only knew 2 of the people there.  <br/>
Well things started bad, and didn't get a whole lot better.  <br/>
When I got there, I was the sixth person to arrive.  We needed 2 more people for the tourney to be sanctioned.  After 45 minutes of waiting, we just decided to start playing.  Because it was not sanctioned, we just matched up with somebody and played them twice (once light, once dark). <br/>
<br/>
1st Game: Robert Rau (1795) My Mining Deck .vs. his TIE/Sienar Fleet<br/>
<br/>
He started SFS on Wakeelmui.  On his first turn, he plays a TIE to wakeelmui, plays Fear, then draws up. My turn, deploy a site from hand, then another from res via my objective.  He plays another Fear.  I draw the rest up.  His next turn, plays Fear, draws.  My turn, another Fear.  I deploy another site, draw, his turn.  He deploys a Dred, and a couple TIEs to Bespin.  My turn.  He plays Fear.  <br/>
<br/>
By this time I've probably lost 8-12 force from Fear, and the damn card is really starting to get annoying.  Especially since he is continually retreiving them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I drop a Melas to one of my sites.  Put GLiG1 and a Z-95 Bespin Defense Fighter on Bespin.  Deploy Mantellian Savrop,his turn.  He drops some more TIEs, and battles at Bespin.  Plays All Power To Weapons.  I have to lose about 11 force.  I drop two YT-1300s from hand, and 1 off reserve to cover.  Next turn, drain, and deploy Lando In Falcon, and some other crap to Bespin, his turn.  He deploys some TIEs, and retreives almost everything, then battles. Again he plays All Power To Weapons.  He beates me by about the same, and lost another YT-1300, and an EPP Obi for savrip, to cover.<br/>
<br/>
Well, to make a really long story short, and just dominated.  I ended up flipping, and getting Cloud City Celebration going, but most I retreive was 2 per turn.  He continually Fear'ed me, and I couldn't find my WAYTTPOU.  Finally, after running out of cards to sacrifice with Savrip, I lost Bespin.  My obj. flipped back, and CC Celebration was gone.  He drained me, and it took about 2 more turns, until I was done.  <br/>
<br/>
Full Loss By: 26<br/>
Total: -26<br/>
<br/>
He never deployed a character, or location (except for one asteroids field) the entire game.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: NONE<br/>
Lows: To list one, not being able to find my WAYTTPOU.  If I was able to grab the Fears, I might've had a chance.  Oh well....<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Robert Rau. My Hunt Down .vs. his numbers deck.<br/>
<br/>
He starts Hoth: War Room.  Well, first turn, I draw up, looking for a battleground.  None there, we each lose 1 to Visage.  On his turn, he deploys Yoda's Hut, and draws.  Again, we each lose 1.  I draw up again, looking for a site.  I finally get 1, but again I have to lose 1 from Visage (as does he).  His turn, deploys Rendezvous Point, we each lose 1.  My turn, deploy Endor: Back Door, and Darth Vader.  Flip objective, he loses 1.  This turn, he draws, loses 1, my turn.  I drain him for 2, and draw up.  He loses 1.  <br/>
<br/>
His turn, deploys Artoo, some destiny 4 Rebel, and an Incom ingeneer to holotheatre.  Visage is gone.  He inserts Never Tell Me The Odds Into my reserve deck. My turn.  I drain for 2, and draw up, desperately needing a Torture.  None there.  His turn, drains me for 2, and draws.  Well, Odds comes up, and i lose 13 to 2, so I have to lose 11 force.  Damn.  I drain hime 2 force, his turn.  He drains me for 2, then deploys a bunch of speeders to back door.  I lose Vader +3.  <br/>
<br/>
My turn, i just draw up, again.  His turn.  He drains me for 4, inserts another Odds.  I still haven't found my tortures.  So, i draw up, but NO FRICKIN' TORTURE!!!  So, he drains me 4, my turn.  Odds comes up, and i lose 13 force.  Well, I found my tortures, as they were lost.  Well, i'm down to 3 force or so, and I activate it, and draw up.  <br/>
<br/>
Full Loss By: 22<br/>
Total: -48<br/>
<br/>
Again, I can't find a key card, and he barely plays anything.  <br/>
<br/>
Highs: I don't have to play Robert anymore.<br/>
Lows: Can't find my Tortures.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: somebody...Michael, I think.  My Hunt Down .vs. his Profit.<br/>
<br/>
He starts Goo Nee Tay.  I start Mara Jade, and Dr. E at AC.  First turn, deploy Secret Plans, Back Door, Kashyyyk, and Forest Clearing.  I can't deploy my Vader, cuz of Goo.  We each lose 1.  His turn, throws down Master Luke, and some other crap to AC.  I realize i forgot to deploy mara's saber from reserve.  He battles, and clears me from the AC.  He can't retreive, cuz of Secret Plans.  My turn.  Drop Darth Vader foil =o) at AC.  Also drop ECC 4-LOM and Dr. E. (it was put back in my hand with Luke, earlier).  <br/>
<br/>
His turn, he plays ECC Chewie and Lando.  Battle. Sends Dr. E to my hand.  I target Lando with concussion rifle.  He targets 4-LOM with Chewie's Blaster.  Miss.  I play Jabba's Through With you, and draw a 1,1. He draws a 1 (i think).  I lose all, and that covers. I don't really remember what he lost.  <br/>
<br/>
My turn, drop choke Vader, ECC Iggy, and Dr E.  I choke Han, he gets rid of Dr E with Master.  I capture Chewbacca with Iggy.  I don't remember destinies or anything, but I lost nothing, and he lost everything.  His turn, he drops Ben, his saber, master luke, epp han, epp leia.  Battle.  Ben swings, hit's Vader.  I play Circle, and Focused Attack.  He plays Courage, but i sense it.  I draw a 5,5,1.  My total is 17.  He draws a 3,4+2 (saber).  We tie at 17.  The battle continues, and I lose everything, and he loses Master Luke or something.  <br/>
<br/>
I really can't remember much more detail.  After a ton of battling, we are pretty much dead, and it comes down to draining.  I'm draining for 4, and he is draining for 3+2 from objective.  I get my last Vader, beatdown on EPP Han at AC.  His obj. flips back, move Vader over to where EPP Leia is.  <br/>
<br/>
We end up battling in space a little, but my destiny was what kept my alive.  I drew 6's continually, and it was just devastating.  <br/>
<br/>
Full Win By: 11<br/>
Total: -37<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I WON!!  <br/>
Lows: Not beating Ben in the duel....but i'll live.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: same guy.  My Mining deck .vs. his dueling Hunt Down<br/>
<br/>
He just quickly takes Bespin, and drops Vader w/ saber, and Mara w/ saber to my sites.  He is draining 6 a turn, and i'm doing my best to cover it.  I've lost a ton, and i finally get EPP Obi down, to Vader's site. He circles me, and i lose by a ton.  Obi is OOP, and I lose 9.  That is pretty much game for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Full Loss By: 32<br/>
Total:  -69<br/>
<br/>
Well, i finish in 5/6.  I didn't play very well, but it was a great learning experience, and I did some good trades.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Robert ended up winning (beating up on me, gave him a pretty high differential =o).  <br/>
<br/>
Well, thanks for reading,<br/>
