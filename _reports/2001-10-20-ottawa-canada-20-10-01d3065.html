   One day this week i go check up on D to check to see if my rating has been updated from all the way back when i played in DPC Montreal....of course not, so i check what the hell for a tournament hasn’t been one, but hey Martin Leblanc (one of the two people besides me who I actually consider pretty good here) musta signed up to be a TD and he was running a tournament this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
 I see this as a little problem I have a paper to write on the Iranian Revolution (it was assigned), a Physics Assignment and two tests to cram for. Plus I wanted to go out on Saturday have some much needed fun. So I luck out and get Friday off cause of an event at Ottawa U for people who’d apply for next year (so every senior went day off school slick) So this gave me time to finish the physics assignment (it was a @#$% to do) and both of the girls I was gonna choose between to go out with this Saturday were working (although how i was going to choose i don’t know) So that freed things up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 So anyway Saturday comes around the same decks from DPC Montreal are still around.. and I head off. So I show up there and only 4 other people were there 5 minutes before it was supposed to start..yeah that’s great and 3 of them are total losers i don’t even want to talk to. One of them even asks me if I’ve been changing my decks around recently, what a dumb @ss. So I wait around thinking of how i could of slept in and then there walks in 3 more people.. ok we have 7 (cause one of the 4 who were already there weren’t gonna play) Then some scrub shows up and we can start.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Game 1 My Podprofit vs Mike Smyth’s ISB walker stuff<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah so i haven’t played since Montreal so I was totally rusty this game. I made all stupid mistakes like forgetting to drain forgetting profit damage and just not deploying at the right places. He has all the dbs possible on Tatooine and was spread out with walkers n jank with ORS all over. I win the podrace, I retrieve with I did it and all. And i did something i’ve never done before I mistracked and missed an On The Edge it sucked ass. He ended up beating me by 17<br/>
<br/>
 FL 0 (-17)<br/>
<br/>
 Game 2 My Senate deck Vs John Cain’s Toshe Harvest Crap<br/>
<br/>
  I get a pretty janky hand except for the hoth war room and keeder which helped alot this game. I didn’t get Lott Dod out until about 3rd turn. He didn’t do much at the start Qui Gon went down to Toshe but that really it. I set up my whole senate deal drop Palpy and Janus to the Naboo Throne Room. He sets up Han/Luke at the Outskirts and Lando with Axe and Ben at the Cantina. I respond with Keeder and ROC to put down those drains before they start..as well as This is outrageous so i was fine. I go to kill qui gon he gets lucky once or twice but in the end I kill him. He’s essentially locked and everything he tries to do to pull himself back up gets smacked down by me.. and the EPP Vader who kept coming back for more. So i schooled him by a nice ol 27 cards<br/>
<br/>
 2 (+10)<br/>
<br/>
 so yeah nice easy win.. lunch time.. We all go to leave.. Mike is outside smoking up...damnit man it’s 2 in the afternoon... So we head over to the mall I go with Klepy to check out American Eagle first cause well I wanted to get some shirts... but yeah hunger came before my need for clothes so I didn’t buy anythin then. So yeah we go up to the food court talkin @#$% bout some crap party klepy was at yesterday complainin about school and all that nothin really interesting to anyone but us n @#$% so back to the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
 We take like half an hour or so to get back cause we took forever in the mall and we ended up playing each other how convienient.<br/>
<br/>
 My Podprofit vs Kyle Klepy’s Court w/ Rancor and @#$%<br/>
<br/>
  This game was wicked gay to start he just builds up at the AC, I draw up like crazy. Only force lost for me at first was tunnel visions and a couple ASB so winning the podrace wasn’t too great. So for about 10 turns it’s just me going through my deck getting what i need and him deploying more @#$% to the AC. I eventually decide, yeah this is getting dumb so cause of stupid Emphant I deploy everyone all at his Enterence Cavern so i can move over later Obi, Luke, Qui Gon, and Lando w/axe sit there for a turn until i decide yeah this is dumb i’ve gotta go in there. I have RLR Gift of the Mentor which isn’t much so i send Obi/Qui Gon to the AC and know i’ll be able to RLR over. So he battles I slash 2 of them (4lom cancelled Luke’s text) we each got 3 destiny and all he ended up losin was Emphant and the two i slashed (jabba and someone else) I lose Obi (i had another in hand) and Resiliance Luke to my hand. So they both come down next turn to fight some more, I slash 3 guys (I too closed 4lom’s targeting)<br/>
and he’s only got a couple left I lose obi and Resiliance Luke again. He moves what he has left over to Lando’s site. I come down with Luke and take out all of the stuff at Lando’s site and they move over to the AC. In a final last ditch blow Bane and a Thermal Detanator come down to the AC he doesn’t draw a 1 and he loses the game.. a nice try though. I win by 37<br/>
<br/>
 4 (+47)<br/>
<br/>
 Game 4 My Senate Vs Mike Smyth’s Jedi Council Podrace junk<br/>
<br/>
 I was bored at this point i didn’t really want to play.. but i did anyway.. if you can call what i did playing.  I really didn’t want to play. Everythime i lost cards i did it just from the reserve to finish this quickly and he ended up winning by 27... whatever<br/>
<br/>
 4 (+20)<br/>
<br/>
 So yeah whenever my rating gets updated losing to Mike twice is gonna hurt it. But all i have to do is remind him how many games he won back in montreal was it none or something like that before he dropped in the 5th game or somethin yeah that’s it.<br/>
<br/>
 So if i actually felt like playing at the end i could ended up 1st or 2nd probably second cause i think Martin went undefeated. so yeah me and Klepy go to AE after this and yeah go.<br/>
<br/>
 Props<br/>
 Martin for holding a tournament<br/>
 Klepy for showing up.. I needed someone normal there<br/>
 My decks for working when i care about the game<br/>
 The mall for getting an American Eagle<br/>
 some other stuff<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Slops<br/>
 Scott Molnar for quitting the game and selling all his cards (but he did get a PS2 with the money so it’s not all bad)<br/>
 Both girls were working.. fate is against me<br/>
 yeah some other stuff<br/>
<br/>
 So yeah next tournament is after R3 is out..if I buy any and I’m free that day I may be there, but i figure that will be a tournament won by whoever spent the most money on R3 so John Cain and the @#$% cause they are losers with 20 non unique @#$%in destroyer droids.<br/>
<br/>
 Later <br/>
