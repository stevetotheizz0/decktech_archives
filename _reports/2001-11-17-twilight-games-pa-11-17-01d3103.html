<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I arrive at the store fairly early {12:20}. I get ready for the tournaments by borrowing a few key cards {2 Coruscant Mauls, a Maul strikes, and 2 Delagates for the Dark side}, and for the LS {Tat Obi, 2 Gimme a Lifts, and Yoda}.<br/>
<br/>
Well, finally, after borrowing these "key" [I use that term loosely for my LS deck, since its a pile], I build the decks.<br/>
<br/>
For Dark Side: DARK SIDE SENATORS, revolving around Lotti Doddi. Check out my deck at my Member Page [Episode 1: Dark Side Senators: For Tournament]. I changed it a bit, but its basically the same, but with the above cards added.<br/>
<br/>
For Light Side: It’s Ryp’s Pile. Exactly as shown on my member page [Ryp’s Pile]. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, the Dark Side overwhelms with there sneaky senator tactics, and the Light Side revolves around Jar Jar being sly and Mexican like.<br/>
<br/>
Once the players show up, we notice not enough people have Ep1 decks. So, when a player is using a deck, for 3 of the players, their borrowing someone else’s deck of the opposite side of that player. James Leiser, the tournament director, made himself the last man, so it would be sanctioned.<br/>
<br/>
Game One: Me LS vs. Phil DS<br/>
His Dark Side deck is the Dark Jedi Combat objective. It seems decent, but I feel DS Senate is the way to go in Ep1 only. The combat objective is probably better OUTSIDE of Ep1.<br/>
 Well, he gets his Maul, if I remember correctly, the Coruscant Maul to the 3/2 Naboo site. [By the way, I am sorry if I am sketchy on some of the Ep1 cards, I am very un-use to them]. Anyway, he loads up the site. Drops the 2 Bladed saber, and tells me to go. I set-up a few key cards {ie. Threepio at the Council}, and start my jank. He’s winning the podrace at this point 4/0 {he drew Tatooine Maul for his destiny}. On his turn, he discards 1 to drain for 4, I promptly reply with a Vergence. I then explode in the racing. For the rest of the game, its him trying to catch up in the race {which is ironic, since the LS should be doing that}. I stack his Colision on my A Tragedy, and he stacks my Backwards. Luckily, I only need to play 2 {because he stacked a 7 once and a 6 once, which is waaaay too good for Sebulba}. Jar Jar dies quite a few times and replenshes himself in his "tank" and I use the Lift to bring him back. A few key battles with Padme getting Qui-Gon and destroying Maul with the cut. Flipping his objective helped alot {no Finger of Death}.<br/>
Finally, I control both his Naboo sites.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win: 2 (+13)<br/>
<br/>
Props: None really. No BIG mistakes were made by either players.<br/>
<br/>
Slops: Same with above.<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: Me DS vs. James LS<br/>
Last round James was borrowing my DS Senate deck and destroyed his opponent [Won by like 36 I beleive.] Unfortunatly now James knows my Dark Side deck pretty well. And James is a very good player so he knows how to use this information, hehe. Well, first turn he gets Threepio, drops him at the Arena. Drops Malastare, and one Naboo fighter, knowing I have no ships in the deck. Great, thats a 1 drain for the rest of the game. I set-up with Lott Dodd, and flip the objective. Unfortunatly to an early drain I lost the +3 destiny Political Effect. He comes down with the Senate beatdown squad {Mas, Yarua, and Tendon}. He battles, and I am stuck with Lott Dodd. He loses Tendon, so he still has Yarua and Mas. Having no Senators in my hand, this is bad. So, on my turn, I move Lott Dodd over to the council {and since I couldn’t use his ability, I couldn’t get a senator}. I first drop Coruscant Maul to the Senate and move him over to keep Dodd company. The next part, was totally unfortuante. FOR ME THAT IS! He drops Qui-Gon. Battles. I drop sh!t for destiny and kills no one. He kills Lotti Dodd. So Maul’s stuck there. I attempt to battle on my turn with reinforcement from Orn Free Taa, and Orn catches it hardcore style. On his turn, he drops Yoda, Depa, and Ki-Adi. Battles, I draw a freken 1 for destiny. He draws a 5. SH!T! Hehe. I lose Maul, and 10 more force. Then, a turn later, I win the podrace, but I spent like 5/6 Podrace Collisions to do so, that I basically only retreive those {he captured my Squabbling with the shield}. From there on, the game goes down hill, as I lost most of my characters from the big battle. Then, with Yarua and Mas controlling the senate he was retreiving more force and force draining for more.<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss: -27. 2 (-14)<br/>
<br/>
Props: Messing up on Coruscant.<br/>
Slops: Not reading my own cards well enough.<br/>
<br/>
We took a quick break, all the smokers smoked, and I play Rory in WWF a couple times. I loaned Drew Scott my Stone Cold deck for the FreedomCon, so I am stuck with my semi-decent Semi-Scoop Chris Benoit deck. It goes 2-1 against him. {Of course it would... I’m ranked 57th in the world in WWF....}.<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: Me DS vs. Matt LS<br/>
Once again I am using the Senate deck. Its Ironic. I thought my Senate deck would do great {going 2-0 and my LS going 1-1}. But it turns out my dark deck goes 1-1 and my LS 2-0. Sigh. Oops, there went all the suprise for this game, yea, you can just skip it if you want.<br/>
  Anyway, he’s playing the LS version of the Combat objective. I honestly don’t think the objective is nearly as good as the Dark Side’s or any other Dark Side deck. I mean, to begin the game, on turn one, I was activating 9 force. Thats isane. Well he drops Qui-Gon. I control the senate with Baskol and Lotti Dodd. I rate a turn, and get hit by his drain. No big deal. He Lose’s Track on Sebulba, making him hit. Semi-big deal. The Dark Side’s version is better, cuz the Light Side is going to stack more race destinies, so they’ll end up losing more force, but still good idea. Sebulba’s hit, and venting fumes. But, I use Lotti Dodd to get Maul’s saber. Drop Coruscant Maul at Qui-Gon’s site. Drop the saber. Battle. Cut him in half. Maul strikes. I drop a senator on the political effect to make his destiny -3, so he has a 0 destiny. I clear the site. Its really sad, this Maul doesn’t leave the game until like the third to last turn where Yoda kicks his a@@ in lightsaber combat {its really funny}. About 7 turns later, I win the Podrace. And then three turns later, I squabble for a retreival of 3 cards. Looking good so far.... then Jedi Obi comes down {the Ref3 version of Obi}. We duel. I Parry his "combat card" and make him redraw. He draws a 3 and a 2, which turns to be a 2/2 due to the parry makes it a minus one. I draw 2 fives. He loses Obi and the top 2 cards. Bad for him. This leaves Jar Jar alone there with Maul. On my turn, Maul promptly kicks his ass. He then drops Yoda and we do some running around to cancel each others drains. The whole time Baskol hitting him for 1 a turn with her ability. Three turns Yoda combats Maul and wins. But I pull it out.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win: 2 + 37 (4 +23)<br/>
<br/>
I play Rory in another game of WWF. I win again. He gets pissed, and wants to play me again, and I again I beat him. Oh the joy.... of being good.... hehe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game Four: Me LS vs. Wicky DS<br/>
Well, going into this, Wicky is 6 +80. I am 4 +23. So, I know he’s going to win the tournament. Its good to see Wicky win, because he’s been playing for so long and spent so much, that its good he’ll be rewarded. He’s playing the Dark Side combat deck. {I turn out to be the only Senate deck there, for both sides}. Matt borrows my DS senate deck, and goes on to win 2 +46. Thats pretty good. <br/>
I start my usual LS Jank. The podrace in this game, was VERY intense, where it took both of us to waste like 4 of each of our Backwards/Collisions respectively, to usually make one of us end at 24, FINALLY, at the very end of the race, its my 30 to his 24. I win the race, but he only loses 4 force since he controls 2 Naboo sites. I wasn’t too worried about that, I was just happy to get the 6 force retreival. The whole Racer shild hurts me. But I get Malastare, and he never gets a ship [or he doesn’t have a ship] and I drain him for 2 for remainder of turn. I got Naked Threepio set-up at the Council first turn. And Ki-Adi takes control of the Arena. Finally, Jar Jar does enough hit and runs taking out 1 character, losing from the battle, and ending the battle, to wear his forces down to just Maul and Rune Haako. Finally, we get to the point where we’re chasing each other. But I’m the one getting the drains in, and he’s the one attempting to block them. I meet the requirements for the Racer shield, so I can use I Did it, to retreive my 4, then the 1 per turn {since I control Malastare and the Arena}. Finally, we just settle down and sit there at each other. He only ends up having 1 card left. We just sit and combat each other, with a tie of having 7. It takes him several turns to realize that the retreival of my 1 per turn, doesn’t affect my reserve deck {since I did it, takes the bottom card of my lost pile and places it on top of my force pile}. So we continue to just tie in combat. He finally decides to just draw up. <br/>
<br/>
Full Win: 2 +26 (6 +49)<br/>
<br/>
Props: For Wicky putting on a good show in the final game, hes a great up and coming player with a great spirit, and hes a great kid. His mom’s pretty nice too... always a plus.<br/>
<br/>
Slops: None. I came in second, good enough for this SW Scrub. hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Final standings: SECOND.<br/>
<br/>
Thats right, I took second. Even though I through a pile together, and that I suck at SW, I got second. Thats good enough for me. Wicky takes the EPP Maul for his prize. And the random selection for the EPP Qui-Gon lands on me. So, once Decipher gets around to printing it, it’ll be coming my way. <br/>
<br/>
Then, in my 3 packs I get {1 pack per win} of Tatooine, I pull the normal image Maul, a Jar Jar, and the Munchen. DECENT. Since, almost all of my EP1 LS decks revolve around the big ol’ Flappy eared Jamaican Gungan named JJB! But, this gives me my 3 Maul. Even if their all Tatooine Mauls, at least its 3, not 2. Heh.<br/>
<br/>
PROPS: <br/>
For James running the tourney.<br/>
For Palante in holding it at Twilight Games. <br/>
For getting the EPP Qui-Gon, which is a kick-ass card.<br/>
For pulling a Maul in my packs afterwards.<br/>
For Rory Mexican being there to make me feel good after the one loss, by stomping his face in with Benoit. SUCK THIS KANE!<br/>
For Drew Scott for being at FreedomCon and giving me a chance at doing good in a SW tourny. =-)<br/>
<br/>
SLOPS:<br/>
For Palante opening the second Reflections 3 box, that he should have saved for the shop to sell. Oh well.<br/>
For not having enough players, and having James play.<br/>
For Gay Steve showing up, and well... being gay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully we’ll get more players next time.<br/>
<br/>
