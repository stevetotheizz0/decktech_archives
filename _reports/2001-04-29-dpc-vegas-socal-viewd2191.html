<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Pre-tourney<br/>
Friday &amp;#8211; I*m supposed to leave 4PM from my house in San Diego, Caleb Smith is supposed to be there a bit before, he manages to show up about about 5:20.  We get to the Best Western at about 11:30.  Really bad traffic.  I decide to rip apart my ISB deck to make a hunt down, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to work, so I will put my ISB together in the morning.  I also take apart my half-existent LS profit deck in favor of hidden mains.  Fall asleep at 1:07<br/>
Saturday &amp;#8211; We wake up at about 6:30 slap together my ISB, have breakfast at the hotel, and head off.  It takes us like 30 minutes to find the Thomas and Mack center, then another 15 to find where the tourney actually is.  What a pain.  I fill out decklists, and we start at around 10:30.<br/>
Other San Diego players there are Jim Lafferty, Zach Erwin, John Borders, Bryan Nakamura, Patrick Garcia, Caleb, and myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I got some of the details messed up, it was a long day. <br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
My LS vs Casey Barson*s Dueling Hunt Down<br/>
Well, I didn*t quite know what to expect, he starts Hunt Down with the standard start, and I set up my Hidden Base beatdown crew.  First turn, He gets a 1-0 docking bay, and draws.  I bust out Dagobah, the Hut, and Home One Docking Bay and Tatooine from my hand (I think&amp;#8230;)  We don*t loose to Visage.  I draw.  Second Turn, he drops DS2 Docking bay, and draws.  Don*t loose to Visage.  My turn, I activate quite a bit, draw some, drop Mirax to H1 Docking bay, deploy Tat docking bay, and Courlag.  Next turn he drops a PotF to the Ds2 Docking bay along with DVDLOTS with his stick, 4-Lom, and Dr E.  Makes me loose to Visage&amp;#8230;  I drop Blount and Chewie Protector to cancel Visage after I attempt to cancel it with Out of Commission &amp; TT.  I then draw,  It goes back and forth with drains, he comes down with Mara to kill Chewie and Blount, I was planning to duel Vader since I had Glancing Blow and Courage of a Skywalker, and he caused Obi to be lost from DS2 (don*t remember how though, but it was a kool tech card)  And the game goes downhill from there&amp;#8230; I did drop Blount again (retrieved him with OTE) to the Med Chamber to drain for a bit.<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;21<br/>
Props &amp;#8211; Blount is the man<br/>
Slops &amp;#8211; None really other than I should have brought my old deck.<br/>
1 down 7+ to go.<br/>
<br/>
After I recorded my results I had to figure out which card I didn*t list on my LS decklist since 59 were only counted on paper and 60 were in the deck.  It was Gift of the Mentor that I had forgotten about.  I got a minor warning&amp;#8230; whatever&amp;#8230;  Caleb had the same thing happen to him, but he only had 55 cards counted on paper.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 ISB Vs Bryan Nakamura*s WYS Space Drain<br/>
This game started out really, really bad.  I forgot to put in Prepared Defenses.  I wasn*t allowed to switch one in, so I was forced to start with a Twi*lek.  On top of this, Bryan is from San Diego, and we play each other often, so this game has gotten off to a crappy start.  Lucky me!  I get Mob Points in my starting hand&amp;#8230; thank god!  I can actually get activation and do ok this game.   I get a killer hand, not to mention I got MobPts.  I got Bargaining Table out, and flip second turn.  He Kessel Runs about 3rd or 4th turn after I*ve drained him a bit.  Soon we realize that this will be a drain race.  I have no space in my deck, so all I can do if pray that I can out drain him.  I get a generic docking bay set up at Kessel to subtract from his drains.  He tries to do an asteroid sanctuary after droping some asteroid fields and Luke on Red 5 to Big one, but is unable to utilize it because I*ve got a ORS at the a related location,  I drain him out for the win.<br/>
Props &amp;#8211; that hand and ORS*s seldom used game text.<br/>
Slops &amp;#8211; Girard for not letting me get a Prepared Defences, and for playing a San Diego player.<br/>
FW +23<br/>
Total so far &amp;#8211; 2(+23)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 &amp;#8211; LS vs Danny Rider*s MKOS<br/>
I don*t remember much of this game other than beating down a whole bunch of people that were on the sail barge with Obi, Lando with Axe, and LSJK with Stick.  I think 4-lom, Fett with Gun, Dr E, and some others were on board.  I played Gift of the Mentor (the card I had forgotten:-) to draw a 4, 5, 5, and 6 for destiny.  Clears the site.  I can*t manage to hold off in space after Squassaning for Kaptain Han like 3 times&amp;#8230;. He kills off my Dash in Ship after dropping ZiMH with Guri to comply with I*ll take the leader.  It goes way down hill from there, somewhere along the line I got Monnok losted and I lost both my On the Edge*s with the 3rd one already in my lost pile.  Sucks.  I should have stayed with profit, it would have killed this. He drains me out for free while I struggle to pay for my drain of 2.<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;25<br/>
So Far &amp;#8211; 2(-22)<br/>
Props - Gift of the Mentor, how could I ever forget that card.  How ironic J<br/>
Slops &amp;#8211; Monnok.  I wanted to rip that card in half.  <br/>
<br/>
Between games there are raffles with the tickets you get after you record your results&amp;#8230; I never get anywhere close&amp;#8230;<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 &amp;#8211; DS vs Jeff &amp;#8220;My Evil Clone&amp;#8221; Lavigne*s Operative Filp Deck.<br/>
This is what I had been waiting for, everyone kept saying that we looked like clones or something.  It was really weird, we looked about as close as you can get with out being related or a clone.  This was to be the Epic Battle. Hehe.  I am fortunate to get Prepared Defenses in my starting hand along with a twi*lek.  He drops his operatives on board speeders, and flips, I flip the turn before controlling the Hoth DB, and Y4: DB, and get decree and bargaining table going.  This is the ultimate retard game ever.  All my drains bonuses are canceled, then &amp;#8211;1 because of his Objective and Menace Fades, so I can drain for like 2 total each turn, then retrive one.  He drains for 3, and I cancel 1 about half the time with Bargaining Table. I beat down with Mara, Vader, Xizor, Guri, and ORS to make him loose some stuff, but he retrives  each time he deploys and opp, so it is a very slow game, he has Bargaining Table and the starfighter bargaining table out too.  I edge out the win.<br/>
FW with 2 minutes to spare - +10<br/>
Total &amp;#8211; 4(+12)<br/>
Props &amp;#8211; winning the Epic Battle against my evil clone &amp;#8211;Jeff if you are out there &amp;#8211; e-mail me at ggblade@hotmail.com<br/>
Slops &amp;#8211; that was one long game.<br/>
<br/>
Jim Lafferty drops along with Bryan after they both manage to go 1-3 with super crappy differential.  John and Zach are at 3-1 while Caleb is at 2-2 along with me.  At this point I am STARVING&amp;#8230; John orders pizza, and I think we ate it after game 4&amp;#8230;  <br/>
Side note &amp;#8211; just had about 4 or 5 advil&amp;#8230;<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 &amp;#8211; DS vs Charles Hickey*s WYS (Doesn*t everyone play this damn objective)<br/>
I get a really bad hand, have low activation, he drops Luke and Melas, and some other random smuggler to flip, it takes me like 5 turns to flip, I don*t get a single walker out the entire game.  WTF!??!!  I finally get some people to beat the snot out of Luke, but he dodges.   Oh well, not much else to tell, he basically kills me. If I had had that prepared defenses&amp;#8230;. Hmmmmm&amp;#8230;<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;19<br/>
Total &amp;#8211; 4(-19)<br/>
Props &amp;#8211; none really.  <br/>
Slops &amp;#8211; Dodge and WYS in general, I hate that objective, and half the people are playing it.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 &amp;#8211; LS vs Ben Cavin*s Black Sun<br/>
I had not expected to see this deck, so I did not know how about playing against it.  He drops the DS docking bay with a PotF, Dengar, Vigo, and  moves Xizor over like 3rd turn.  I get my activation going, then drop LSJK with Saber to the Tatooine DB, and hold Lando and Obi in my hand with a fallen portal and OTE on the table.  He drops IG to capture Luke&amp;#8230; awwwwww&amp;#8230; I still drop Lando and Obi, miss the fallen portal, and we both take some damage.  He drains me out. L <br/>
FL &amp;#8211; 17<br/>
Total &amp;#8211; 4(-48) not looking good.  LS still hasn*t won<br/>
Props &amp;#8211; someone krazy enough to play Black Sun<br/>
Slops &amp;#8211; IG, that SOB<br/>
<br/>
Game 7 &amp;#8211; LS vs James Eby from Alberta Canada*s MKOS<br/>
Yay, maybe I will have my revenge against a MKOS!  I kick the crap out of his deck, lots of characters with tons of activation equals battle damage.  I clear multiple sites, and drain.  It was funny that I out of commissioned his Prepared Defenses, and I told him about what happened to me. I don*t remember too many details, but  it was fun to play against Jim.  I constantly made fun of him by saying crap like &amp;#8220;force drain of one, ay?&amp;#8221;  <br/>
FW +17 Hell ya!!! LS wins!!!<br/>
Total &amp;#8211; 6(-31)<br/>
Props, a fun game, even though I don*t remember much of it.<br/>
Slops &amp;#8211; none at all, a very pleasant game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8 &amp;#8211; DS vs James from Kanada*s EBO.  Woo Hoo<br/>
Well this was a fun game again.  I remember a bit more than the last one J.  I don*t drop Carida (don*t get MobPoints in my starting hand) So, I wait a few turns to drop ORS in Walkers to the 4th Marker and the Yavin Docking Bay.  I get my drains and Decree going really quick, and he beats down the scout on his walker at the 4th Marker, so I have to deal with drains for a turn.  I do manage to drop Vader, and a walker to the 4th Marker, I clear the site, then he Ice Storms Vader. Hehe  I*m too lazy to search party for vader, so I just drain him out.<br/>
FW +19<br/>
Total  8(-12)<br/>
Props &amp;#8211; fun game again &amp;#8211; with more detail<br/>
Slops &amp;#8211; Ice Storm and Prepared Defenses.<br/>
<br/>
So I finish out 4-4 with Negative differential, who cares, it was fun!<br/>
<br/>

1. Jonathan Chu 14(+129) <br/>
2. Kyle Craft 13(+138) <br/>
