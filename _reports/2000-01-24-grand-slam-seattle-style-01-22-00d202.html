<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, after I'm finally writing my grandslam report.  <br/>
<br/>
The Seattle Grand slam was a blast, hosted by the great Doug Taylor, and Todd Soper(STCCG).  Also, Kevin Reitzal of Decipher was in attendance.  I went into this event not really sure as to what to expect, but I was positive of at least a 4-2 preformance.  I was expecting a 3-0  DS preformance, and hoping that my Lightdeck wouldn't lose to something unexpected.  Thanks to Mike Mikealians for the ride up to the Game center, and for sticking around for me.<br/>
<br/>
So, deck selection as follows:<br/>
LS:  YCEPBT/OBD<br/>
DS:  Huntdown/Big Blue<br/>
<br/>
Getting to the matches now.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS vs. Gabriel Carlile.(1500)<br/>
So, it turns out that this is Gabes first game in a tournemant ever, and it showed.  Vader came down turn 2, and the Visage does the damage for remainder of game.  He hs 4 different planet sites in the deck (not 4 sites, but 4 planets) stuff that only deploys to certain places, and nothing to even confront me with.  But something that has never happened before happened this game, I had an ewok inserted in my deck.  (he meant to do AFA, but pulled the wrong card).  I help him out the best I could, but by deploying, and even fortifying (I'm not getting drained, might as well deploy what's in hand) I win by 33<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: none really, besides the inserted ewok.  Felt bad playing a new player<br/>
Lowlights: Playing a new player.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS vs. Eric Wilsons Hunt Down (1751 that should be 1800, due to decipher error)<br/>
Well, Eric starts Crush the rebellion, and a couple aliens.  First turn, Trans terminated. (yeah!)  So, I lose some cards to some early drains, get boussh dow under cover, lose some shmoes to walker and two destiny (Irol and drelosyn).  well, I have 10 cards in lost pile now, so, let's go free Han.  so I flip (after putting master luke down for free), and start my fallen portal, narrow escape action.  The walker finally comes over, and I drop a couple guys, Mechanical Failure, and battle, gift of the Mentor.  I smoke screen on destiny, draw a 4, then a 0, cancel with han, redraw a 4.  So, He looses the two biker scouts, and 17 cards.  Ouch!.  From here I keep control, and avoid the battles I want.  FW by 17<br/>
<br/>
4(+50)<br/>
Highlights.  Stomping huntdown, turn 1 trans terminated.  Playing Fallen Portal, weapon lev, then narrow escape in one battle.<br/>
Low Lights: None really, a well played game<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS vs. Peter Sundholms flipping endor objective (1868)<br/>
Well, Peter deploy no aliens (phooey).  I get leia at the bunker turn one (parked with her gun).  I get set up on tatooine, and get my good cards going in hand.  He's getting some drains going, and I wait till I have 10 cards lost.  Okay, time to spring Han.  So I release, flip, retrieve 9. From here, I get a bit fortified, Ben anf Han together, and Luke and Chewie Chilling.  As the game goes on, and Leia doig as much damage on endor as possible, I start getting in a good drain, and loss of force.  The game comes down to me getting tamteel and orimarrko, doing some narrow escape action.  I win the drain race by 4.  6(+54)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Not bad for ominous rumours and a HUGE endor drain of 5<br/>
Lowlights: None really, an awsome game.  (never did get my surprise assault before his flip)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My DS vs. Erik Wilson (1751)<br/>
Erik start MWYHL'ed, and I do huntdown.  turn one, down comes momaw and Han to holotheater.  My turn, activate 3, twilek, grab CHYBC, activate rest.  deploy that and Vader at some endor site.  At some point, I have 6 cards in lost pile, and one is a vader.  OOC he plays.  well, I wouldn't even bother typing this if Vader wasn't grabbed.  Okay, time to Fortify Vader.  Down comes a walker and pilots.  Okay, I got this drain going to his none.  Next turn, Avenger and needa go to Endor.  He drops tantive, and Lando in Falcon.  battles, I draw a 3 (yoda don't stop that).  Needa remains, Falcon Runs to Dagobah.  so I get some more drain in, stop his on CC with U-3PO, and when he finally comes back to endor, I drop 2 ships, lateral damage and battle.  He looses a bunch, and I won by 17 (twice in a row, that the game was decided on an equivlant card)<br/>
8(+71)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Vader out of play, and noway he could touch him<br/>
Lowlights: None, deck worked perfectly<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My DS vs. Douglas Harvilla, My Nemesis! (1853)<br/>
Okay, So I'm playing Doug, and his insane high destiny deck with THREE, 3, Tres, This many III! Obi's aperations!  Agh, you're sick!  So, I'm getting activation hosed early, can't find coruscant or the happy fun ball, and am over powered by his 5 destiny in a battle, and every flip being 4 or higher.  uck.  The ugliest Lightdeck I've seen in a while.  a good deck, played even better from a great Opponent.<br/>
Full loss by 11<br/>
8(+60)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  None really.<br/>
Lowlights: Simply put, playing Douglas.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My LS vs. Derek Snook (1797, former 1900+, but dropped from endor regional, and hasn't been updated since)<br/>
To make the final show down, this is a must win.  As Snook is the only other undefeated, and there is 10 point in differential between us.<br/>
Well, Another Endor objective, strictly ominous rumours though. Unexpected.  He starts with Fett and gun, and Mara in the Audience Chamber.  his turn 1, he moves them outside.  Okay, well, in my hand, if there is a CCG god, he was smiling on me.  I had 2 Master Lukes, anakins sabre, Clash of sabres, Disarmed, Blaster deflection. just a bunch of nasties.  so I drop luke, clash Mara, battle fett, let the chance of a hit go (fett missed) attempt to bounce mara (failed) and swung and hit fett.  Drew a 3, and that's Fett and 5 cards.  so, 5 off the top, Walker, 3 pilots, and something else.  Ensuing turn, Disarm on Mara.  I got the proper cards in lost pile, retrieved them when I sprung Han, and had complete dominance of the ground game.  FW by 23.  10(+83)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  God draw against Snook.  I just seem to have his number in our games.<br/>
Lowlights: Nothing, beside the crushing defeat of a friend. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, so now it's REALLY late (9 o'clock) and Harvilla and I getto do our face off.  but first, deck verification.  Doug Taylor told us before we didn't have to do it, unless we expected to be in the final.  I didn't expect to be, but I still did it.  So, I take a pee break, and a deep breath break.<br/>
<br/>
Douglas and I get to play now, and he chooses his DS deck.  Okay, his huntdown deck has carried him through 2 qualifiers, to a second place finish in each.  Not looking to happy here I am.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1.  Doug starts with Mara and Boba (go figure, right?)  I trans term turn 1 (woohoo!).  Okay, so I am, losig a little to drain 2 on his second turn.  Down comes Boussh, and her gun (this got a great reaction from Kevin Reitzal).  okay, dougs turn.  I announce disarmed!, and he goes, no, I get first action, so he goes sniper with Mara.  This is one of those cases when I feel that he wouldn't have done it had I not jumped the gun.   Well, Leia dies.  Okay, so he got another drain of 2 on me, so I have7 card in lost pile.  I wait a turn.  I have now 9 cards in pile.  Time to spring han.  So I get set up, spring han, have Boussh again blocking drains, and in on battle, I fallen portal someone, steal mara's sabre, and narrow escape (deck is built to do this!)  Well, with my selection of red cards, and a disarmed Boba waltzing around, I'm afraid of no weapons.  but now comes BUBO!.  50/50 chance to get Han, nah, We'll go for Ben instead.  whooooooo!.  That was the last chance right there.<br/>
Full win by 13<br/>
<br/>
highlights:  4-0 with Profit!  Best marketing Push Decipher could ask for.  I demand royalties :-)  Beating Douglas.<br/>
Lowlights:  none.  I beat a well refined Tourny winning machine.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, 'Didn't we just leave this party?'<br/>
Well, This game flowed pretty much similar to the first, but I tried to win it in space today.  Well, Tantive and all the EPP's and destiny adders, vs. the imperial fleet.  Doug wins out.  Vader dies, with an addition loss of 10 cards (hurt!, maybe even the game differential breaker) and the last card I lose is Lateral Damage.  Easy come, easy go.<br/>
Full loss by 17<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  None.  I hate this deck, errg!  I'll get you for this Douglas!  :-)<br/>
Lowlights:  Prison, after I get him for this :-)  Actually, no U-3PO in either of our games.  Lame.<br/>
<br/>
Douglas 2(+4)<br/>
Charles 2(-4)<br/>
<br/>
Great match, great Tournemant.  I did my job in proving the Lightside objective decent.<br/>
