<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is my first attempt at a sealed deck tournament report.  From what I’ve read, they seem pretty similar to normal tournament reports.  So here goes.<br/>
<br/>
So because I don’t have a car it takes me over 4 hours to get down there.  I left at 9:00AM and arrived a little after 1:00PM.  So needless to say I wasn’t in the best of moods to start the day off.  The director, Jared Jensen, began to question which affiliation we would prefer to play.  Since I have yet to see a Jedi Luke join my collection, I state my preference as light.  It appears that there is an even number that wants to play each side and so we begin the draft.  There are two tables, one with four drafters and one with six.  As luck would have it, I was on the table with six.  Here are some of the "power cards" that I drafted.<br/>
<br/>
Melas (what a winner)<br/>
Independence (monster in space)<br/>
Red Leader in Red One (another monster as long as he doesn’t get talon rolled)<br/>
Traffic Control (what a great card in sealed deck)<br/>
Lift Tube (and not one site to put it at)<br/>
2x Lift Tube Escape (to get the lift tube I can’t deploy)<br/>
The Signal (but nothing really cool to signal for)<br/>
Bomar Monk (he’s the shizzbangnippity, see report for details on this one)<br/>
<br/>
So I get my deck built in a matter of minutes.  With the cards I got it was rather easy to do.  I have for my starting location Tatooine: Jabba’s Palace, secondary starting location is Jabba’s Palace: Audience Chamber and my last resort is Tatooine the system.  So lets get going.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Me vs. Derek "Daeyel" Conklin  <br/>
Rating: 1457<br/>
<br/>
So I start with Tatooine: Jabba’s Palace expecting to bounce his site back into his deck.  To my surprise he starts with that Endor site that your Yuzzums deploy for free at.  I think that’s kind of odd since it’s not even a drain -1 site.  I think its odd, but pay it no heed because that just gives me a place to drain him at on the ground.  He goes first and deploys Kashyyyk and Traffic Control.  That doesn’t make me happy since it will allow him to track his destinies relatively easily.  My only way to counter it is to draw my own Traffic Control to combat his destinies.  On my turn I deploy Melas and the Tatooine: Docking Bay, draw and say go.  I use to say "May the Force be with you" but that got to be a little too corney, even for me.  He deploys two TIE scouts to Kashyyyk and Obsidian 7 to Tatooine.  I think that’s fine because I have Red Leader in Red One in my hand and he doesn’t get a destiny at either location.  I deploy RliR1 to Kashyyyk and battle his two TIEs.  I draw a 6 for destiny and he has to lose both of them and two battle damage, just for future reference, this will be the last thing to go my way this game.  I move him to Tatooine and draw a few.  He deploys Arica to Jabba’s Palace and leaves her undercover to block my drain.  He plays Dark Maneuvers on his Obsidian 7 and then proceeds to talon roll my ship.  He draws a tracked 6 and I draw a 4, which is not enough to save my ship from dying.  So I die in space, never to come back.  Not from a lack of trying, but because my ships go to the lost pile during his next control phase.  During my next turn I deploy a 2/2 guy to back up Melas and the Bomar Monk to the docking bay, all the while holding a Fallen Portal in my hand.  He deploys Grand Admiral Thrawn to the docking bay, then takes him back and deploys him to Jabba’s Palace.  Breaks Arica’s cover and battles.  He draws another tracked 6 for destiny and I draw Kessel.  A 0!!!  I can’t believe it.  In a sealed deck where I have only 3 0’s in my deck and the rest are destiny 3 or greater.  Anyway, I play Old Ben to revive Melas and lose the pilot.  He has to lose nothing because my luck in this game is really getting pretty bad.  No, wait, scratch that, its not getting bad, it IS bad.  So he stays at Jabba’s Palace and forces me to move to my docking bay.  He’s draining me for 4 in space as he has deployed another TIE to Kashyyyk and another to Tatooine.  I eventually take out his forces on the ground, never getting to use my Fallen Portal.  He deploys 2 yuzzums to his starting location late game along with a 2/2 pilot for a destiny draw and ends up draining me out.  <br/>
<br/>
FL 0(-13)<br/>
Standing 0(-13)<br/>
<br/>
Good:  Getting RlinR1 in my opening hand<br/>
Bad:  Loosing him to a stupid talon roll in a sealed deck<br/>
Ugly:  Have you seen Derek early on a Saturday morning?  Definitely not pretty.<br/>
<br/>
So I didn’t win game 1 and I figure that I probably don’t have a shot at first now so I can relax and just play for fun.  Yeah right, its time to get my BLOODY VENGANCE on the dark side.  I pity my next opponent.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Me vs. Eric "Bootylicious" Meyers<br/>
Rating:  1586<br/>
<br/>
So I start the game with my site, which is Tatooine: Jabba’s Palace and bounce his back to his hand.  Next I go for the Audience Chamber and bounce that one back to his hand as well.  Strategy successful.  Now I get to deploy my Tatooine, the location I really wanted to start with in the first place.  He gets all upset at my site strategy and starts off with his usual "I hate this game" talk.  It really gets quite old and boring to hear.  So first turn he deploys Tatooine: Jabba’s Palace and goes and gets the Audience Chamber, lot of good that did starting that as my starting location.  He uses the game text on the AC to deploy Arica.  He leaves her undercover.  I think this is odd especially when he starts to move her over during my turn.  Still not breaking her cover.  So I deploy a couple of scrubs to the AC along with Melas and a Bomar Monk.  I love that Monk.  And so I’m now draining him for two at the chamber and one at Tatooine.  He deploys a bunch of guys to the audience chamber and Mara has made her way back to the audience chamber and is prepared for a fight.  So I give him one.  He initiates a battle and I draw my tracked destiny 6.  He draws a 4 and I lose Melas and bring him back with Old Ben.  He loses Mara because she has forfeit of 7.  Since he hasn’t left himself enough force to move away, so he leaves his 4 musicians there.  I battle on my turn and draw a 6 again, that along with my Florn Lamproid (cumulatively adds 1 to attrition) I clear the site.  He deploy’s IG88 w/ gun to the Lars Moisture farm by himself.  I don’t want to mess so I continue to drain him at his AC and at Tatooine.  The Independence makes an appearance at Kiffex and the game just turns into a one-way drain race.  That one way being my way, so the victory goes to me.  <br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+21)<br/>
Standing 2(+8)<br/>
<br/>
Good:  Got my BLOODY VENGANCE on the dark side<br/>
Bad:  Having to play against a whinier and a complainer.<br/>
Ugly:  Beating a deck that was actually better than mine, by a lot.<br/>
<br/>
So now I’m 1-1, which kind of sucks in sealed deck because you have to rely on others to beat the person you’ve already lost to.  In this case I have to rely on someone beating Derek, which I don’t think any of the light side players are capable of.  So going into my next round I am only thinking about taking second and making sure that none of the other dark side players win.  I must now continue to do that and hope that someone can beat Derek.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Me vs. Jared Jensen<br/>
Rating: 1643<br/>
<br/>
This game I start off the same as the last, bouncing his starting location back to his hand.  He then opts for an interesting selection, the Cantina.  So I then get to start with the Audience Chamber.  His first turn he deploys Jabba’s Palace (Why do I even bother with that starting location strategy?) and then replaces my AC with his.  He doesn’t use its text, lucky me, and draws a few.  My turn I deploy a Bomar Monk and a Bargwin to the AC and say go.  He now wants to use the AC’s text, but I point out to him that he can’t because the Bomar cancels his game text there.  Go Bomar!  So he decides to deploy a few TIE’s to Tatooine.  I’m laughing because on my turn I drain him for 2 at the chamber and he loses from hand an All Power To Weapons.  I smile and deploy the Independence to Tatooine.  I initiate a battle and he now wants to play a card from hand.  He tells me "I lost the wrong card from my hand, they’re all red and I got confused" and now he wants to play the APTW.  I inform him that that card is now in his lost pile and he is unable to play it.  He continues to argue and I finally cave in and let him play it.  He loses by 2 and now he wants to lose both of his TIEs.  They are both forfeit of two and so now I have to tell him that he can’t lose both because one would satisfy all of the battle damage.  So he decides to leave them both at the system.  On his turn, he drains me at the Cantina with a small band of characters including Barquin Dan.  He also gambles and I win.  During the game I think I retrieved about 4 force thanks to him.  My turn I deploy the Docking bay and Melas and a 2/2 scrub there.  Next turn he deploys a Walker, Moff Jerjerrod and another scrub to my location and battles my guys.  I draw a 6 (my tracking skills seem to be improving) and he draws a 3, so I lose my scrub and he loses his Moff.  He then moves his characters over to Jabba’s Palace and proceeds to draw a few.  After draining I retrieve my top card and then proceed to deploy my Chadra Fan to the AC to join the party.  He never comes there the whole game.  Late in the game he tries to deploy a TIE Defender Mark 1 and another starship to Tatooine and initiates a battle.  He says he wants to Talon Roll my guy.  I have to inform him again that you can only Talon Roll with a TIE l/n.  He says, "Prove it" and I show him in the rules where it is.  He then takes back his deploy and just draws.  I have out my Reactor Terminal and its getting pretty close to the end of the game.  I retrieve my device/weapon with the Bargawin and drain him for a total of 5.  I then use the Chadra Fan to look at a card from his hand, and guess what, it was a Dark Jedi Lightsaber.  Sweet!!  So I put it into my deck with my Reactor Terminal and deploy a couple of guys to his lone Walker, battle and draw my tracked 6.  He has to lose his walker plus about 5, it was only a Hoth 2 player walker so it didn’t have a lot of forfeit.  And that’s the ball game.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+20)<br/>
Standing 4(+28)<br/>
<br/>
Good:  Beating another better dark deck with a pretty crappy light deck<br/>
Bad:  Having Tatooine: Jabba’s Palace deployed on me again on the first turn<br/>
Ugly:  Having to tell/remind the tournament director holding the tournament of the rules<br/>
<br/>
So I’m now 2-1, Derek, who was undefeated going into this round, got beat.  So now I actually have a chance at first because there are no undefeated players.  This makes me feel a little better, especially because I have such high differential wins.  I’m pretty sure that if I can just win this next game, I’ll take first for sure.  And now, time for the final game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Me vs. Tom "Bomar" Ercanbrack<br/>
Rating:  1664<br/>
<br/>
So now I get to play Tom.  Tom is a hit or miss player who will either do really well or really poorly.  I sat next to him in the draft and I know that he pulled a Lord Vader foil as well as a Dengar with Blaster Carbine.  I knew that he would be my hardest match up, especially if he gets to deploy either of them.  The details of this game are a bit fuzzy.  I know that my starting strategy for locations worked and I have the Tatooine system as my starting location.  Turn one I throw down my Reactor Terminal.  And it’s not long before I have RlinR1 draining at Tatooine and the Independence draining at Kiffex total of 3 in space.  It didn’t take long for him to deploy his Vader.  Turn 4 he hits the table.  He has a lot of vehicles draining at two sites and they about equal my drains in space.  I deploy Dice Ibegon (sp?) along with a Bomar and a scrub to the AC and he moves Vader over to the adjacent site.  I deploy Melas and Florn Lamproid to his site and initiate a battle with Vader.  I draw a tracked 6 to give him 7 to attrition.  So down goes Vader and with him any hopes of even winning this game.  He tries one last ditch effort to beat me down in the AC, but just ends up losing all of his guys to my massive attrition.  Like I said, this game was kind of fuzzy and so this just seems like all that happened.  I apologize for the lack of detail as this was my best game and I don’t even remember it very well.  But I know that once I killed Vader, it really took the wind out of his sails.  <br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+9)<br/>
Standing 6(+37)<br/>
<br/>
Good:  Being able to kill Lord Vader with attrition<br/>
Bad:  Getting drained at my own sites for the entire game<br/>
Ugly:  The look on Tom’s face when I took down Lord Vader.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I end up winning the tournament.  I get a really cool Obi w/ Lightsaber foil box topper while second gets his choice of any two enhanced cards and a pack of R2.  Not really fair, but I was just happy that I won.  Here are the standings as I remember them.<br/>
<br/>
1.	Me 6(+37)<br/>
2.	Hartman Anderson 6(+?) LS<br/>
3.	Derek Conklin 6(+?) DS<br/>
<br/>
Here’s a list of slops and props.  Although these might seem dumb to some of the readers out there, this happens to be my favorite part.<br/>
<br/>

Hartman for giving me a ride home and not making me wait for the 4 hour bus ride<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
Me for losing to Derek in the first round<br/>
Eric for whining through the entire tournament and never having anything good to say<br/>
Tom for scrubbing out and going 2-2 even with a Lord Vader, Dengar and an Emperor<br/>

Well thank you for reading.  I hope that this was as entertaining to read as it was to type.  I hope to see you all again soon in my next tournament report.  Until then.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
