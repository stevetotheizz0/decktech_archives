<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">My first tournament report...<br/>
<br/>
Here’s the sitch:<br/>
<br/>
foil vader and foil luke for first place.<br/>
<br/>
top players:<br/>
(spelling might be bad)<br/>
<br/>
Zach Stenerson,<br/>
Mike Raveling<br/>
Josh Kohman,<br/>
Graham Neal,<br/>
<br/>
and there are some tough and less<br/>
competitive players:<br/>
<br/>
Andy Dahl,<br/>
Brian Herold<br/>
Gary Murphy<br/>
Casey Culkin<br/>
<br/>
and many others I’m sure I am forgetting.<br/>
<br/>
Tournament is at noon, some of the players<br/>
are traveling 200+ miles in the near blizzard conditions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I’m playing hidden ebo v 1.5, and Cole Ryba’s tie deck<br/>
<br/>
First Match:<br/>
<br/>
i get paired against some wash-up scrub, who is just<br/>
getting back in the game.  My hidden/ebo against his<br/>
i don’t even remember what he played.  This guy played<br/>
twilek advisor for his starting effect, i beat him without<br/>
lifting a finger, he said, "wow, you played great",  I<br/>
win by 17.<br/>
<br/>
Second Match:<br/>
<br/>
Against Shane Butler, and old nemesis.  My ties against<br/>
his mind what you have learned/super falcon/on the edge<br/>
deck.  He cheats a small bit buy saing he dropped yoda<br/>
from his reserve for -2 when it came from his hand.  I<br/>
whip on his superfalcon for his loss of 13 force, he<br/>
mis-counts tracked destiny for on the edge, he stalls<br/>
the game out, i get a timed win +22.<br/>
<br/>
Third Match<br/>
<br/>
Against Zach.  My Ties against his mind what you have<br/>
learned/superfalcon/on the edge deck.  He spanked me,<br/>
I drew up.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth<br/>
<br/>
Hidden ebo vs Brian herold’s hunt down.<br/>
<br/>
he epic dueled my obi at ehco docking bay, and lost.<br/>
i didn’t play smart and lost the match.  harold is very<br/>
wormy to play against.<br/>
<br/>
fifth:<br/>
<br/>
my hidden ebo against gabe andersons bring him before me.<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of this match, some newbie scrub that had<br/>
the bye was running around pissing people off, i get<br/>
distracted and irritated, couldn’t recover, i lose<br/>
to gabe.<br/>
<br/>
6th<br/>
<br/>
my ties against gary murphy’s ebo y-wing swarm.<br/>
<br/>
he get’s his ebo set up and on the next turn, he drops<br/>
7 or so y-wings to 7 different sites, all for free.<br/>
<br/>
he drains me for 15 the next turn.  my ties and dreadnaughts<br/>
by some miracle chase him off, i win!<br/>
<br/>
Josh Kohman ends up winning.<br/>
<br/>
I’m sure i forgot to mention alot of people, and i probably<br/>
didn’t spell many names right, but like I said, this is my<br/>
first tournament report, it’s like playing a new deck,<br/>
a little strange at first, then later i learn where<br/>
i could do some improving.  <br/>
<br/>
After the tournament, a bunch of us went to perkins.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to all the guys from the cities, st. cloud,<br/>
and surrounding nodak places for braving the weather<br/>
and making this the best tournament i’ve seen<br/>
in this town in a long long time.<br/>
<br/>
p’s and s’s<br/>
