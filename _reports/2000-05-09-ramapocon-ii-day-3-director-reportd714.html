<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">OK, after a long Saturday night, I woke up around 9am and finished putting<br/>
up signs directing people to the Sunday location of RCon - the H-wing<br/>
Auditorium.  I get there and the tables are not set up so George Gundry,<br/>
Mike Publicover, and Johnny Rivera (someone else too...cannot remember)<br/>
help me out and we get set up.  People start to come in and then Rich<br/>
shows up even though he wasn&amp;#8217;t supposed to.  He tells me he calls in sick<br/>
;) so he can play!  Great news for me, the more competition, the more fun<br/>
it is for me at least to watch.  So after all is said and done prepping<br/>
for the tournament, 36 people show up and form 8 different teams of 4.  We<br/>
discussed making this event sanctioned but then realized we will<br/>
manipulate the pairings and that makes it unsanctioned.  It works out<br/>
better for everyone because that way people could have more fun with it.<br/>
I know that Bob Caton played a experimental deck 'for the heck of<br/>
it because it was non sanctioned.  Plus all the incentive people needed<br/>
was the Trophies I had up for grabs.  First place was to get the Endor Set<br/>
of foils and once again I used George Gundry's idea of getting posters<br/>
signed.  I had 3 up for grabs for this one.  The competition was stiff<br/>
with lots of very good players.  After about 45 minutes, two people, Neil<br/>
Hoffman and Ivan Turner from Staten Island show up in time for the second<br/>
round.  Bart was gracious enough to switch teams to play with them and we<br/>
now had 7 teams of 4 and 2 teams of 3.<br/>

So in all the event went great with everyone's help. I kind of messed up<br/>
the pairing 3 times! ;).  Chris Twig won the overall best score and earned<br/>
the Endor Set of foils.  Team Charlie&amp;#8217;s Angels won the team tournament with<br/>
the trophies and the Team Champ T-shirts.  Afterwards I raffled off 10<br/>
support.  I also had 38 more foils to give away that everyone had to pick<br/>
face down.<br/>
<br/>
Props-<br/>
-Rich Haman helping me with the command cards throughout the entire event<br/>
so I would not mess the pairings again ;).<br/>
-Bart Robinson for switching teams when part of a team showed up.<br/>
-Aaron Kingery and Arthur Wright for helping Rich and I figure the team<br/>
tournament results in the 'special room'<br/>
-Doug Faust, Ray Bordier for helping throughout the day.<br/>
-The people randomly following my arrows on campus thinking I was holding<br/>
the 'Open House'<br/>
-Everyone for playing!<br/>
-Everyone for signing my cards in my Light Side Deck!<br/>
