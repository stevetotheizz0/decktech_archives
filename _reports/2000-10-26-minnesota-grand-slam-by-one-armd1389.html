<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">	Okay, here’s the deal I was preparing for this tourney for like a month and a half. Then one week before my school tells me that I have to take the PSATS that day. WTF Sophomore PSATs don’t mean crap, but that’s what I get for going to a private school. Then 3 days before the tourney I get a pinched nerve in my neck...It hurt like hell, so I start taking some codeine for the pain. In one of my drug visions I realize that I can still go but miss or be late for the first game. SCORE! PSATS were easy, BUT some dumb people asked too many questions so I ended up being 30 minutes later than I expected. Oh Well. I got there at the end of the first game. There had been an odd number of people there 47, so I took a loss for 0 in my first game. Damn! The rest of this tourney was done while under the influence of Codeine. I do not recommend the use of this drug except in extreme circumstances....;).<br/>
<br/>
Oh BTW I was playing Trinity Hunt Down (to be posted) and a revised version of my Tinker Toyz deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My Hunt Down VS. Anthony Lawrence’s Profit.<br/>
I decide to take a chance and I start Mara and Ephant Mon.... they stay there the whole game. I had a 2nd turn Vader with saber at the defensive perimeter...he stayed the entire game. Pretty early on he got a couple of scrubs to the Meditation chamber, but I didn’t have the resources at the time to kill them. I set up a few drains on Tatooine with walkers. And that was the game. Afterwards I found out that Ephant mon had kept 4 characters including Lando from being deployed. Full Win by 11.<br/>
<br/>
2(+11)<br/>
<br/>
High-Winning without having a bad game.<br/>
<br/>
Low-Stupid constant Drain of 2<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My Hunt Down VS. Josh Grace’s Fake-out Hidden Base.<br/>
	Well this started out bad.  Similar to what he does in Middle Earth:CCG (one of the best out there) he curses my Vader’s to the bottom of the deck. It turns out I didn’t draw a single character till third turn and no Vader till fourth. He got an early Lando and Gold Squadron 1 to Endor to make Honor immune and exactly the wrong time, right before I got Vader out. I did not drain for anything, due to Tk-422 and a Projection. Farmboy Luke got an advantage over Mara, which I could not get rid of. He wins by 25.<br/>
2(-14)<br/>
High-Not losing by more<br/>
Low-Stupid Devil worker J/k...;)<br/>
Game 4 My Tinker Toyz VS. Chris Perman’s SYCFA Star Destroyer.<br/>
	Well For the first couple of turns his deck confused me. It wasn’t until I saw the Star Destroyers and his Admiral’s order that I was able to build my machine (see my deck name). Second turn he Captured my Madine with Iggy. I ended up setting up fairly fast without madine. In space it turned out to be a battle for endor.  I was trying desperatly to keep my Objective flipped so I could get some good drains in. With the I’ll Take the Leader I was able to cycle a couple of ships and Pilots. After he Lateral Damaged Green Squadron 3 with tycho and beat up Tala 1 with Lando , I deployed Nein Numb to the GS3  and some other pilot for 2 destiny. They took down the Executor with a darklighter spin and a 6.  I was able to hold on to Endor because I’ll take the leader let me save the ships. Han ended up in Green squadron 3 to hold endor for Game. FW by 3 Great Game! BTW Darklighter Spin is GOD!<br/>
4(-11)<br/>
High-Winning a Great game<br/>
Low-Chris Losing a great game<br/>
Game 5 My Tinker Toyz VS. Chad S?????’s BHBM<br/>
	Sorry I forgot your last name Chad. This game stunk. I got a bad draw, and I couldn’t do anything. I don’t remember many of the details. But I used Darklighter Spin Again for money. I ended it with a couple of suicide battles. My loss by 18.<br/>
4(-29)<br/>
High-Darklighter Spin is Money.<br/>
Low-Losing without a chance.<br/>
Fianl Game My Trinity Hunt Down VS. Chris Perman’s Rebel Strike Team.<br/>
	His deck was pretty original..I won’t say why becuase I forget...But I know it was original. He never flipped the entire game. I got a pretty early Vader to beat down and we fount a bit. He had the only space the entire game, but I was draining him for tons on ground and at the same time I kept his ground in check. It was a fun game and almost as close as the first against him. I win by 4.<br/>
6(-25) Not bad for missing a game.<br/>
High-Winning a Great Game<br/>
Low-Beating Chris Perman twice in games that he could have won.<br/>
Well Josh Grace ends up winning the tourney and both games of the Final confrontation, so I don’t feel to bad about that loss. And it’s cool that he gets the sheets.<br/>
Here are the final Standings:<br/>
1. Josh Grace 10 (+87) *<br/>
2. Mike Raveling 10 (+75) *<br/>
3. Josh Kohman 10 (+67) <br/>
