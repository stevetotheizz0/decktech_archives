<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">All right. In essence before I begin as is standard and highly justified, I’ll do a little prolouge cause those things are just fun to do. <br/>
With all fairness there will be silliness and detail in this report. <br/>
<br/>
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to this tournament I’m online, scoping decktech, looking for a LS deck and checking out some differant dark side decks. A nice BHBM crosses my eye and I start to modify it. I get an AIM from fellow D-techer JEEBS and we start going over it. Then I throw out this crazy idea for BHBM numbers and ties. No joke. <br/>
I mulled it over and I was sure LS would be unprepared for it. Surprise factor wins so many games. Anyhow I only have 1 Palpatine so I make the deck praying either I can borrow one from somebody or protect Palpy with my life. My LS is a retooled baragwin / scouts and I’m sure it’ll do fine. I crash at 3 in the morning and get a phone call from work at 8. (Some people have no decency. They KNEW I worked till midnight the night before!)<br/>
I get to the tournament locale and sure enough Matt Berta has a Palpatine for me to borrow. Sweet. We get set up and the Director Shane Watner lays it out cold to some nazis and then gets the game going. There’s only 8 of us so instead of doing 6 games like we planned, we’ll end up doing 4. I’m gonna need to practice majorly for states which is next week.   <br/>
<br/>
GAME 1<br/>
VS. Matt Berta (Somewhere in the 1700’s I think)<br/>
His DS Hunt Down (does it ever change?)<br/>
VS. My LS<br/>
<br/>
Well I guess this is gonna be a fun game. We get all set up and his opening hand is apparently crap. Seriously, a dog came along, @#$% in his hand and he used the poo to play sw:ccg. (Poo, it’s not just for one-liners anymore) I’m not sure but I think almost throughout the whole game his hand was crap which accounts for some of my luck in this game and the smell.<br/>
I actually get enough force to put out Madine and a baragwin and a force left, so I make us lose to visage first turn. Deploy my stuff, retrieve my weapon, take a scout and deploy the Landing site. He draws. I pull some scouts, set up at the landing site, draw some search for that damne ewok and fail. Throw down some support scrubs at the back door and prep for a drain of 3. He drops Mara Jade and his pants but then realizes he’s totally out of line for doing that and pulls his pants back up. We drain back and forth, me retrieving half my lost weapons with my 2 baragwins. Finally he musters up a crew and moves to the back door with Vader w/ Sabr, Tarkin, Mara and Dr. E Combo.<br/>
It’s gonna be a tough one with the Doc but I drop Jedi Luke, saber, Clash the Dr. (he didn’t start crush and suddenly regretted it.) and battle with almost all my scouts at the site. He plays projective and I don’t have enough force to stop it. Damn.<br/>
He runs and leaves the Doc to stop my next drain. Punk. Luckily I have Obi-wan with saber so we’re still visaging and I keep getting my weapons back. He finally moves back to cover the Dr. I bring it on with full fledged ness ness.<br/>
Another Jedi Luke, Anikin’s saber and another scrub. Hit the Dr. and almost hit Vader but Tarkin cancels the destiny. I lose Midge and he misses Luke. Solo cancels the destiny like only he can and I end up with power 52 to his 22. He loses everyone and 15. I start to spread and drain. He drops a ship to drain in space and another Vader far away from the scouts to drain. I keep making him visage and just get mad drains on endor with a timely On the Edge to retrieve 6. I finally get a Fallen Portal (where were you when I needed to protect my @#$% against the Dr.?) and Move Madine to a DB with his baragwin buddies just to even up the drain race.<br/>
I win by 9<br/>
<br/>
GOOD: Beating Matt. This is the second time in a tournament and even though my last win against him was never updated by Decipher I’m headed up.<br/>
BAD: No Fallen Portal. Realizing Dr. E Combo should have been power -3 due to me having 2 lightsabers. And I didn’t add to my destiny for Page’s GT That would have been a differantial booster.<br/>
UGLY: I think Dr. E Combo is twice as ugly as the old Dr. E. And Dr. Evazan scores an all time high on my Ugly Rants with a close second going to your sister the morning after I knocked her up.<br/>
<br/>
NOTES TO SELF: Order to Enagage and Jedi Prescence some how must be added to this deck...And stop knocking up people’s sisters, it builds a bad reputation.<br/>
<br/>
GAME <br/>
VS. Matt Berta<br/>
His DB Mains<br/>
My DS<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I owned this game with my starting hand. Twilek x2, Tech Mor, DLOTS, and Ties. I can pull my destiny 6, wakemuli and next turn drop tech, twilek for numbers and boo-ya. Only one problem he starts Insights. Biyatch.<br/>
So I bide my time. I do what I can in space looking for 3 turns for Endor or kasshyyk. I never get the out...ever. So instead I go desperate and drop a POTF at Wakemuli and start to drain for 1. I get out my asteroid field and Vader. He has out some DB’s by now but still has next to no force to do anything except drop Han and Obi-with Saber. I try to barrier Obi-wan but he desprate reaches. He battles. I try to choke Han but miss. He misses with Han but hits with obi-wan. He draws a zero and I a 5. I win that battle and he is kind enough to remind me to remind him to stack a card I totally would have forgotton otherwise. Props to him for being true. He then tries to OOC Vader but instead OOC’s the barrier he canceled. Bet you hit yourself for that one in the morning!<br/>
I waste no time in Putting out a Tie to get Vader back into my deck. I drop another DLOTS, choke Han, survive the swing and kill obi-wan. Surviving that I start to make comments about Honor and how he sure is gonna need it when I start dueling and if he doesn’t put out Luke. I’m trying to give him every hint to use Insights to pull it so I can drop the numbers cards I have in hand. He doesn’t catch on.<br/>
So back and forth we go. Drain1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 AGGGGGGGGGGGG GOD!<br/>
Finally he gives me Luke, we start to duel and I am making him lose more force. Some battles happen in spae with Home One and the falcon and outrider. The Ties hold thier own even though he senses and grabs my All powers. Damn.<br/>
Then both of us start to screw up and totally forget a whole bunch of things like dengar and a tie don’t draw destiny, force for activation, asteroid destiny...we feel like @#$%s so all cool-like we go back and do it right. Which buys him a turn to drop some pilots on the Home One. I don’t think I’m ever gonna drop my numbers so I flash him my odds and lose it to a drain. THEN he uses Insights. OH SURE! <br/>
By this time we’re next to timing out. And we don’t get to finish. I had a twilek and another odds too! damn.  <br/>
TL By 14. He wins by like 4 all of that force that was lost via my Objective.<br/>
<br/>
GOOD: Hmm. Nothing here to report But I did have a nice mental image of Drew Barrymore in Playboy just now...<br/>
BAD: Scrubbing up like we did. And timing out. I seriously think I could have won it in 2-3 turns afer he dropped the Insights. Almost everything here sucked. No endor, kashyyk, makeshift drains, Insights. GOD!<br/>
UGLY: Insights. It’s a cool pic but what if your dad was all skeleton like that? It’s freaky.<br/>

GAME 3<br/>
VS Brandon Chong<br/>
Court with Capturing<br/>
MY LS<br/>
<br/>
Baragwins owned this game. Lose to Court, retrieve deestiny 7, always. Set up drains for 4 at Back door first turn. His lack of activation slows him down. By the time he brings it, I’ve got a lock. Still no fallen portals but hey, scouts rule. He does use Bossk with gun to snag Han though and for most of the game I’m trying to get Han back. <br/>
He starts to spread thin on tatooine fearing a drain race. I go to battle Mara with Page and Orrimarko and he barriers Orri. <br/>
Ok. I totally forgot about that Skywalkers i put in here and had in my hand just in case he had a barrier (also I use it for BD’s) The turn later I realize it and yell. He doesn’t battle though, cause I’m too cool and he instead relocates Ephant and Jabba and mara to the AC with Boelo. <br/>
Do I Battle 2 BD’s or a swing BD and a canceled BD? Well with first strike out, I’ll do the 2 BD’s which are low. Mine is decent and I toss both scouts to attrition of 5.<br/>
Tracking 7’s twice I on the edge for 6 so I gained 12 force which is so cool. At one point I retrieved 3 7’s in a row.<br/>
Jackpot!!!<br/>
By this time Xizor, Guri, Bossk are running on endor and I am still draining. I finally get Leia out, save Han drop jedi luk with saber and drain up again. He last ditches with bane, iggy, and j’quille. I decide to fallen portal iggy just cause capturing sucks.<br/>
yay, I lose the battle by 5 cause of chewie being excluded but it’s all right, cause his next turn he drops Ree Yees with Xizor and battles. I Portal xizor, smack reeyees and draw a 7. Game<br/>
FW by 14<br/>
<br/>
GOOD: 7’s. Where’s the slot machine when I need one?<br/>
BAD: Bossk snagging Han. J’quille being a tough guy.<br/>
UGLY: Oh, it’s a toss up, the trandoshan or the whiphid...YOU MAKE THE CALL!<br/>

GAME 4<br/>
VS Dan Christy (just made it to 1910, congrats!)<br/>
WYS<br/>
My DS<br/>
<br/>
Most smugglers are destiny 2 or 3 but Han and Luke are out almost this whole game and yes, he has the cantina shuffle going later on. My first force loss is Death Star Assault Squadron  and he OOC’s it. Dang Vader must live!!! To my credit I have Vader out already at a DB, my Tie Stuff set up and a POTF on Tatooine. <br/>
The only thing I lack is getting a third character out and some activation after he flips. Garindan, a droid, Tech mor, Kasshyyk, anything...I insert the numbers after getting mad and drawing the other one. <br/>
The shuffle is hurting a little but then he decides to bring it to tatooine. This is where we go at it. <br/>
I can’t take the shuffle anymore so I snag Luke, and await the beatdown. It only consists of Mirax and Chewie with rifle, whom I choke. I have to lose DLOTS but his forfiet is all good. Vader did what he needed to ths game. Meanwhile over the planet of Tatooine...Interceptors, SFS cannons and Dreads vs. Wedge and x-wing and Dash. Dash is gone and he loses Wedge and ship and then some to cover damage. Could have used an all power to weapons...<br/>
He still wants to bring it. He drops Dash in ship again, Teron Net and his X-wing and I barrier the x-wing. Throws a wrench into Dan’s plans. He backs up wedge some and I bring a few more ties my next turn, Shoot down the x-wing and have the ability to fire again at the outrider but he few manuevers so Dash stays alive. <br/>
He goes to move to my Kashyyk but the Rider clinch card Gravity Shadow says dash stays put.<br/>
Next turn, I drop Tech Mor and the insert more smackdown is laid on Dash, And his space fleet is gone. He loses a lot but the insert doesn’t come up. I POTF at Kashyyyk and spread to drain in space while he does the same on the ground. <br/>
He goes to activate, says he’ll activate only 3. After #3 the insert comes up he loses 8 and I just try to get as much force back via TIE squadrons and draining for 6.<br/>
Game.<br/>
FW by 11.<br/>
<br/>
Man the low differentials are the only thing that hindered my placement but hey, coming in 4th is cool. After all it is an honor just to be nominated...(Oscars at Burger King...inside joke)<br/>
<br/>
GOOD: Fighting in space. I haven’t done that in so long.<br/>
BAD: First turn OOC Vader. WTF?<br/>
UGLY: Well I’ve bashed lots of folks but they all deserved it especially the idiotic 45 year old man in a speedo at the beach with back hair. People go blind looking at that.  <br/>
Who told this guy it’s cool to dress like that?<br/>

<br/>
So the tournament ends.<br/>
I come in 4th! YAH<br/>
Shane wins 1st and I forget the other 2 placers. Sue me.<br/>
And thus the day comes to a close. Well except the fact that I go to work till 1 a.m. drive home and then get online to type this report for an hour and a half. What was I thinking??? Well I’ll be going now, there’s some crack left in the pipe and I’se be feeling mighty funny right now.<br/>
Damn where’s that Ho when I need her...<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I’d just like to thank Jeebs for deck construction, Berta for the Palpy, Your sister for the Blow Job and the Acadamy for doing whatever it is they do. And if you don’t have a sister then I’m obviously not talking to you so bugger off! </font></td>
