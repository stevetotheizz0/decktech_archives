<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">	Ok, this was just another tournament at Galactic Quest, the local card shop.  There was a decent turn out, around 14 or so but Alex and Tommy Bursi dropped cuz they*re gay.  I won without a loss, but I had 2 close calls.  I was playing a fairly standard DS Senate beats/lockdown with EPP Maul, Palpy, and the old skool vader/tarkin beatdown combo.  My LS was Boomrace (which is still the best LS deck IMO), which just outlasts the opponent with its massive retrieval and direct damage.  Anyway, I played well and screwed up once tracking to blow the bunker, but its all-good gravy.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My: DS Senate vs. Spencer Norman*s HB flip/mains?<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what this kid was trying to do with this deck, he started Strike Planning and Squad Assignments, and he played space, but he had several Endor sites which he tried to hold with a few scouts but that didn*t last long.  I got set up in the Senate quickly with Lott Dod pulled with an EPP Maul to his hut.  Tikkes and Edcel followed soon with other jank.  I Elis*ed Maul to the Hidden Forrest trail where he had Madine and Midge.  I grabbed Dr.E and Snoop from my force pile and deployed to smack him for major over flow.  He threw down Gen. Solo, CoK and another guy and I killed him there.  Then I just drained him and that was game.  I beat him so fast I didn*t have any idea where his deck was going, so I dunno what he wanted to do.  Nothing too special and the kid wasn*t too good so I felt kinda bad, but that*s life.<br/>
<br/>
FW +30<br/>
2(+30)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2  My: Boomrace vs. Rebekah Gruver*s AOBS<br/>
<br/>
We both podraced and I had the advantage from the start.  She started Presence at Imperial City for an immediate flip, but 2nd turn I threw down EPP Qui-Gon and killed him off.  She drew Xizor for her 1st race destiny and kept it so he didnt hit the table again until like, her last turn.  I just set up shop on Endor, won the podrace, blew the bunker at my leisure and just drained with Midge on Endor for another win.  Fairly non-interactive since we were both beefing up a huge drain of 1 until I blew the bunker and drained for 5 each turn.<br/>
<br/>
FW +30 (again)<br/>
4(+60)<br/>
<br/>
Good first half, but things got a little tougher after this.  I went to Subway with my best bud Alex Bursi, but he met up with an old friend who happened to be a girl so he stayed there with her and dropped from the tourney with his bro.  That screwed everything up and pissed me off, but Ill just have to own him later.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3  My: DS Senate God-of Star Wars vs. Joshua Gruver*s TIGIH scouts<br/>
<br/>
He had scout Luke at the hut for a few turns, but I dropped U-3PO on him to kill that drain while I set up at the Senate.  He deployed the Home One DB and Madine alone there.  Big Mistake.  I dropped EPP Vader to the Endor DB and grabbed Luke, and later deployed Palpy and Janus and moved Vader and Rune Haako to the Back Door for another drain.  I deployed Arica to the Home One DB and broke her cover.  I threw down her buddy Boba Fett BH and killed Madine for like, 10 overflow.  He threw down some scrubs to try and get Luke back, but I said no and smacked down Tat. Maul so they were useless.  I drained him out for another win.<br/>
<br/>
FW +16<br/>
6(+76)  This is funny cuz Ryan Kitzen also was 6(+76) so we decided that the top 2 players would have a final confrontation since it was a 4 game tourney.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4  My: Boomrace vs. Joshua Gruver*s (again) DS Lightsaber Combat crazy 7s deck<br/>
<br/>
Let me start by saying this was the first time that I have ever lost a podrace with this deck since the destiny is just unbelievable.  He burned my first turn with Sebulba and drew a 7, and just ran the race from there on out, but luckily I had the Aim High D Shield so he paid 6 to retrieve 1 and I lost 4 since I had HotJ out.  I fortified Endor while he set up Lord Maul and a lackey at the Generator.  I deployed EPP Obi and killed off Maul, and tried to OOC him but I got something else instead.  He deployed Vader to Generator later for a game long drain of 2 and used DM YA to run around on Endor trying to kill me.  We cleared the bunker after awhile, but I had EPP Luke and such to deploy and blew the bunker next turn.  The 8 retrieval helped me dramatically, since I had to pay for my drains after I deployed Battle Order combo.  I had Home 1 in my hand, which I deployed to Endor after holding off on draining for a turn, but it helped in the long run.  I had EPP Luke and Crix Madine at the Back Door when he deployed P-60 and Dr.E and snoop, shot Luke and owned Crix.  He deployed Palpy to the Rebel Landing Site so things were looking grim.  I was tracking 2 5*s and a 6 so I threw down EPP Obi at Palpys site and hit him for 6 over flow and then Resilience*d Obi who I used on Dr.E combo and P-60 to clear the site.  I was retrieving my scrub scouts and redeployed Midge with Gen. Solo to Landing Site and Orrimarko at the Back Door.  I had a solid drain of 6, and he had 4 that he had to pay 6 for.  It was close since he deployed one last Maul, but I was able to kill him off and got the win.<br/>
<br/>
FW +4<br/>
8(+80)<br/>
<br/>
Final Conflict My: Boomrace vs. Ryan Kitzen*s Maul Mains<br/>
<br/>
I had a good hand with Jedi Luke and his saber, so I tossed him down to the Back Door with Gen. Solo, Crix and CoK in my hand.  He Elis*ed Maul to Back Door after deploying him to his hut and deployed P-59.  He Weapon Lev*d Luke*s saber and pissed me off.  I drew a destiny of 6 so he lost P-59 and Maul so that was ok.  The podrace was slow, but he didnt stack so I won when I wanted to.  He wouldnt give up the bunker to me, cuz he knew if he did the game was mine.  I had mostly scrubs and Leia with Blaster, which was good cuz 1 of my charges was already down and he deployed Tat. Maul and Boba Fett, BH next turn.  We battled and I shot Maul and used Put That Down so he couldnt target Leia.  He played I Have You Now for 2 destinies and I lost Leia and Blount, but luckily after he lost Maul and Boba so Crix had to wait for reinforcements.  I tried to blow the bunker, but I tracked wrong and drew a 1 and 5, rather than the 5 and 4 if I had activated 1 more.  I dropped EPP Obi, but it didnt matter cuz he had nothing in his hand that was any good.  I blew next turn; retrieving everything in my lost pile since I had won the podrace earlier and played I Did It! last turn.  I dropped Ackbar on the Home 1 and drained for 4 and that was the game.  Since it was the final conflict, I didnt count the differential but it was at least 20.<br/>
