<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">fine, quit whining, i’ll remake the report with info this time, geez.  And fyi, the other report under this same name(omg we are all scrubs) was my friend tyler nafziger, we share an account, and i’m not david, i’m mike, the mike he refers to<br/>
<br/>
pretourny:<br/>
for more detail read tylers report, it was exact same for me, except i sat in his car listening to self titled sublime.  As far as decks for ls i was running mad rtp beatdown which was the brainchild of me and wes kissel, it’s basically, 3 lukes hans obis and owen  and berus, and then 3 gift of mentors, harvests, and don’t get @#$%ys, it just goes smacking people around, huntdown dueling potentially owns it, but i was not expecting any today, so i packed no meta, worked out fine i guess.  For darkside i was gonna run cowboys from hell, until i couldn’t fine some of the cards, then i had ben scott make me a skrilings numbers deck running of the court of the vile ganster platform, because of the direct damage, which would’ve raped me if anyone(including  myself) had known what my cards did and lost to it :(, cause nobody would see it coming, this was dumb on my part, because i have never been a good skriling player, or scum decks of any kind,but bla, here’s how the games went<br/>
<br/>
game 1 vs 10 year old with a dark deck<br/>
ok, here’s his start: ds docking bay 327, prepared defenses, combat response, iao, and inconsequential loses( the one that lets you forfeit weapons).  First turn he drops some systems, and draws.  My turn i drop 8d8, move him to the death star bay, and draw some.  His turn he drops a stormtrooper cadet to the death star dbay and draws, my turn, move 8d8 over and draw.  now i tell you, this has been a face pased game of drawing, and when i say i draw, i mean like up to 12, so im saving force.  His turn, he draws. My turn, free leia, drain for 4, retrive my lost pile.  I then procede to throw ep luke and han down at the cadet, fight, play don’t get @#$%y, shoot the cadet, draw my destinys, he ends up losing the cadet and like 28.  After this he deploys nothing else, and i drain him out.<br/>
<br/>
full win 2(+38)<br/>
<br/>
good: um i won? naw it’s no fun beating around 10 year olds, so i gave him some stuff to help him out<br/>
<br/>
bad: what did i just say, i don’t like beating around 10 year olds<br/>
<br/>
game 2 vs brad(hehas a report too, go read it) with falke stylee wys<br/>
well i don’t really expect to do much, and i’m a bad player, but so is he, so it evens out.  First turn i get my barge, but don’t pull rendili with mob points, i do get my executor dbay with my objective.  His turn he plays kessel, i’m thinking, why? he gives me 2 and he gets 1, m’eh,his call, he draws some and its my go.  I drop some skrillings inthe dungeon and give him an insert.  His go, he draws if i remember correctly.  My turn i drop zuckuss in ship to tatooine, and draw some.  His turn he beats the crap out of zuckuss with the outrider, dash, pulsar skate, and the new smuggler from tatooine, so i take like 9 damage :(.  So my turn i’m wondering where pote is, since i’m a moron and don’t know what my audience chamber does, boo!!!  So we mess around, i’m a bad player and keep the skrillings in the dungeon, and he does some drasining which i cancel.  Eventually numbers come up for the first time he loses like 7, he has a bunch of 2s or something.  I then give him another insert.  We just go back and forth with some draining until he drops a bunch of shizzle to the moisture farm, harvests, which gets grabbed, deploys his han and luke, does his trippler, which gets grabbed, and luke runs, which gets grabbed.  Needless to say that would’ve been game, but as it turns out ghhk is a good card.  At this point he can’t do his trippler again since it’s grabbed and he only plays with one.  We keep draining, i’m sitting here waiting for numbers to come up, eventually it does hitting him for 9, ouch, so i give him another insert.  He stops activating, ouch, and some projection doesn’t want me to drain, hmm, well now i invoke the ultimate tech, and play projective telepthy to force him to activate or he can’t drain....So he doesn’t drain, i move my guys to a site and drain for 1 until numbers come up and that’s game, pote didn’t hit thet able once.....boo!!!  and i win by 5.<br/>
<br/>
fullwin 4(+43)<br/>
<br/>
the good: um, i won, that’s cool right? i’m a bad player, he should have won, but apparently hes a worse player.<br/>
<br/>
the bad:  well i’m a bad player so that didn’t work in my favor, and i played like sh!t.<br/>
<br/>
game 3 vs....the real david fairbanks, running ds cloud city sabacc with like 8 landos<br/>
heh, i love sabacc, i used to play it back in the day, until i realized it’s only good for playing against mopes, i guess i’m not a mope then ;).  First turn he drops lando and sabaccs, and it’s grabbed! all bad for him, but he does kill a card from my sabacc hand and double used voyeurs me for the other cards in there.  As it turns out my hand was all bad, one han and 7 red....BOO!!, so i draw i get the moisture farm, owen and some other shizzle.  His turn he drops ig wit gun to the d* prison.  My turn i drop 8d8 to yavin, move to d*.  This whole time hes doin some sabacc and voyuer action.  So that’s all that’s really happening, he never drains me because of battle plan, eventually after much drawing i get my luke, and luke han, and don’t get @#$%y, go smack around lando for like 19, while owen and beru realize it’s time to bring in the crops, and chewie and his friend 8d8 bust out leia, and they move to the d* db.  Well he never gives up, which is always good (or bad?), so vader comes and slashes leia, she’s gone, i lose chewie to attrition, no harvests ever show up so she stays dead.  At this point he drops ponda and dr. e to fight owen beru and wedge.  He gets a 4, i get a 0, ggggrrrreat, wedge takes it.  So on my turn i drop some guys around to drain and battle ponda and dr e.  He draws a....0, i draw a....0, great, i lose to cards.  His turn he drops lando, and then ponda fights owen, we both get 3s, finally, oi.  Well he manages to sabacc some more, but lando dies for like another 19.  I turn out to be a bad player, mistrack my 6 and obi dies for on the edge....boo! ah well, i end up draining him out and winning by 17.<br/>
<br/>
full win 6(+60)<br/>
<br/>
good: well i love sabacc like a brother so it was all fun, plus now i get to play baby komarr!<br/>
<br/>
bad: um i mistracked my 6, that was gay.<br/>
<br/>
game 4 vs. baby komarr and his tat mains starting the slave quarters<br/>
anyway, the reason we call this kid baby komarr is he’s like 10, and his older brother(who plays starwars) is little komarr, and their oldest brother(who plays starwars) is mr. komarr, also known as aaron komarr, you could go look athis decks if you want, whatever.  Anyway, i like playing against baby komarr, because he cracks me up, and he cheats and i still win, in fact, i’m not sure about this, but ifyou read yannicks dpc report, i think he’s the little kid who he played who always cheated.  On to the game tho!  So needless to say i’m a bad player and first turn i pull....nothing, no rendili, no docking bay, no sail barge, gay.   Well his turn he throws down ben and stick(both foil...and unsleeved) to the audience chamber.  So i eventually remeber to pull my stuff and go and fight ben after cancellng his drain with some skrilings, well to make a long story short, he ends up losing one card, and i lose like 5 skrillings and pote, bla.  He drops some sites, with padme, and shimi, and melas, and orrimariko all draining me for more then should have been, great, this is the last time i run a deck that doesn’t start battle order or plan.  well i run around with some skrillings, and my insert comes up a few times, but eventually his drains are just to much for me, but luckilly he’s a bad player, so i only lose by 12.<br/>
<br/>
full lose 6(+48)<br/>
<br/>
good: nothing, i hate skrillings, and i hate losing to baby komarr, on the plus side, now i get to play him with the RTP machine<br/>
<br/>
bad: i lost *crys* to baby komarr *crys*<br/>
<br/>
game 5 vs.  baby komarr with the no objective deck starting d* some effects and he plays epic duel sometimes(go read tylers report for details on that one)<br/>
ah, i love rtp, my opening hand is all good, i drop 8d8 and move.  His turn....he draws.  I move 8d8 again...and draw.  His turn, he trys to play an ao without any battleground system occupation, which gets shot down by the TD(who is his older brother, did i mention they all still live with their mother).  he drops tempest 1 D* db.  my turn, free leia, drain for 4, get back my lost pile,give her a wookie and drop obi to take the tempest out.  Obi does, they move over good times, i draw a few.  His turn....he trys to play his ao again....riiiight, he drops some systems and zuckuss i believe, and plays his ao!!!!! for some fyi, i think he lost tempest 1 to his used pile, but i don’t care, he draws.  My turn i move my guys to yavin,leaving obi at the d*, he drops mara and her stick, but she gets barriered.  My turn i drop luke and han, battle, dont’ get @#$%y, i get the most @#$% lucky draw i’ve ever had....0,7,7,6, whoa.  So he loses mara and alot.  princess moves over and i flip.  Well the lars family go to the moisture farm and harvest the crops, and the spiral, lando in ship, and wedge take out zuckuss out of play.  empy comes to take on the lars, who get...a 0!?!?!?! i quit.   Luckily melas comes to bring it home, the emperor had him now, but drew 2 1s, no immunity, meant he went out of play.  after this i just retrived some and drained him out.  win by 38!<br/>
<br/>
full win 8(+86)<br/>
<br/>
good: i beat baby komarr, btw, he breaks the i don’t like to smack around 10 year olds thing, he’s an exception, rtp is a machine, and this means that this version is undefeated in tournament play, so what if it only played mopes ;)<br/>
<br/>
bad: nothing! yay!<br/>
<br/>
game 6 vs. tyler and the half assed profit<br/>
great, i dont care at this point, i hate profit and skrillings, if you want some detailson this game read his report, all i know is pote is not a champ, and neither am i.  lose by 20<br/>
<br/>
full lose 8(+66)<br/>
<br/>
well i don’t wait for the tournament to get over, i’m tired i go home, lumsten wins, james bottoms gets second, he is such a bad player, so i’m pissed, i get 3rd and a white bordered falcon which ben scott takes.  o well,not like i don’t have a dozen.<br/>
