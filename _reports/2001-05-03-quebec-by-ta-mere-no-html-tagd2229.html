<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok.; errrr . Woof . gryyyy . gryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy <br/>
<br/>
Imagine Pamela Anderson doing that... <br/>
<br/>
AHH it s a tournement report, sorry. <br/>
<br/>
So, my regional was coming soon, and I had no good deck. But, there was a tournement the day before my regional, so I could go test some deck. <br/>
<br/>
The week before, I had really test the Falke beatdown deck a lot.; I did my best with it.; I was winning.; but I was also loosing.; It was not my style of deck.; you needed to be very patient, and draw a lot.; I am not good at that.; But I am sure that the falke version is beter.; the bastian version got no menace fade or celebration.;. But still I lost a lot with the deck, so I probably don t play it right.;. But I will try the deck again, and give it another try.;someday.; because I know It s my fault I looses.; <br/>
<br/>
So, I got there with my girlfriend.; she is so courageous to come see people play card.; There is exactly 8 player + the Burntoaster who direct the tournement.; Burntoast look partuculary in a good mood since he had burn his toast that morning. <br/>
<br/>
First game, I play Mike Pro-tour-player ROPS (biker) deck with my palace raider deck. It s his first tournement, so I crush him. But I grimtash everything.;even his mother <br/>
<br/>
Second game, my World Deck BHBM vs Steven McMuffin WYS deck <br/>
<br/>
Well, I got 9999 power at his farm, and I drain of 5 there.;. But he play 4 lost in the wilderness and 4 control/tunnel vision . . . Its mad.; I control tatoine. He pay for battle plan. He forgot to make me loose from my objective. 1 turn, I move vader, a walker and mara jade in front of him. He got lando with ax, beru and owen, han with gun, chewi. He attack me in space.; Then, I YAB han. Sniper Chewi. Deploy DR.Dre and first strike. Atack, Operate Beru. He got only chewi. Like 15 card lost. FW + 2 . . . <br/>
<br/>
Got, I am lucky.; <br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : My BHBM vs WYS Martin Pereau style. <br/>
<br/>
The guy start the game, and he start singing .; paque Paque, Paquette ville, que Jaime tes binne.; In English it would be : .; Son, Son, Son of a B1tch, remove your D1ck from my Hamburger.;. HE play the Beat Version.;. He made mistake. I won by 5.; Oh god, where does that martin perreau come from ? he almost beat me. And I had never saw him <br/>
<br/>
Game 4 : VS Cheater-Lentopin. HDADTJ <br/>
<br/>
I put my WYS card on table, and say to him. I need to go make a dump. I go. I come back. He got his deck on table. I take my deck, and start shuffling it. I see his deck on table, I ask him if he shuffled it. He said yes, I ve been doing that for the last 5 minutes. I say Ok. BUT . I decide to shuffle his deck. I DOMINATED him. <br/>
So, I am the only 4-0 and I win <br/>
<br/>
After the game, my girlfriend told me he had all stack his deck when I was in the bathroom.; to get the perfect start.; <br/>
<br/>
Well. I go home: I am really tired, and I am desperate, because the BHBM suck, so I will have to build a new deck. I wanted to build a new LS, not a DS.;. So I have no idea, and I build the BHBM TIE LEWIS. I knew yannick was playing afa. And I was 50% sure Raphael too.; but still I told myself.; screw Projective, it s a bad card.; I told myself I won t pull a .;Parise.; <br/>
<br/>
.;Parise.;: name: expression :it comes when Philippe Parise ask us for some Corellian Slip after Alex Klamroth beat him with his talon rool deck when they were testing for DPC-Illinois. <br/>
<br/>
I talk a little with yannick as usual.; and the only good tech we found was grimtash and monnok.;. Those card are huge against alex/raph <br/>
<br/>
I make love with myself, and I go sleep. <br/>
<br/>
I woke up.; Comb my hair with spikes, to intercept the most cosmic energy. And martin Falke number 4 comes to pick me up with the crusher. I striptease a little in front of the car.; but they said go, we are late, go in the car. We go pick Ti-gars (the human machine)(from EVERY point of view). I go inside his apartement to see his fat brother nude.; But he was eating 5 eggs. <br/>
<br/>
Then, we stop somewhere because of a train that was going 15 miles per hours.; then 5 min later.; the train stop . . . . WTF . . . . . then, the train went backward . . . . . . . . . fuc*ing SH .T . . . . . . . . WTF IS THE B1TCH DRIVING THIS SH1T IS DOING . . . . . . . . . . . <br/>
<br/>
So we finaly got there. There is 50 people . . . that is huge . A lot of people to make trade. :) Raphael arrive, and I yell, because he is my idol, and I am happy to see him . But, he forgot his deck :( So, he look in his box, and took a old ROPS deck and a old Dag deck. (in french both deck can be call a .;Deck Su.;) And I am thinking poor raph.; he got no chance of winning with those .;Deck Su.;. But I had forgoten he was a mashine. <br/>
<br/>
So the tournement start in the see of jizz. <br/>
<br/>
And It seems that because of me and clint hayes.; we can t use stickers or blanked out card.;. And everybody laugh at me when the TD say we can t use sticker.; <br/>
<br/>
There is 35 people name, and still all my friends are not names.; sh1t. Well, we are lucky, and we are each at side by side table. <br/>
<br/>
SO I play dark.; I just hope I won T play a profit deck.; because I looses to fast deck. <br/>
<br/>
Damn see of jizz, The guy is playing profit.; I am thinking auto loss.; I ask him for his starting, and he tell me he don t have any.; I am thinking auto win. <br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My BHBM TIE INSERT VS Someone profit deck. <br/>
<br/>
First turn, emperor. He flip. I drop Kashyyk. POTF. Bargaining table, TIE, and say go. He draw. I drain for 3.; he lost 2 ship from his hand.;. :) well.; I think I donT have to tell you the remaining of the game. <br/>
FW +27 <br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My palace Raider Deck VS Burntoast Himself.; he plays BHBM power deck. I am thinking auto-loss. I ask him if he had eaten some toast this morning, and he told me yes, but he had no electricity because He forgot to pay for it.; so they were not burn.; because of that.; I am thinking auto-win <br/>
<br/>
Well, he first turn Janus and emperor to my docking bay. I put luke, patrol craft. Raider. Slash Janus. Draw a incredible 6 and a 5. He lost 3. And he start saying I Am a ChesseEater. And I say shut up, and go eat your toast . Later, I attack the guy that draw destiny alone from special edition and he lost 5 force. I control tattoine. I got battle plan, celebration, and menace fade.; While he only drain in the cantina. At the end I destroy vader for a 15 card battle damage with 4 patrol craft. <br/>
FW +26 <br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My TIE deck VS Yannick Dag deck. ( The duel between jedi master Fong and jedi padawan Max Rebo) <br/>
<br/>
Before the game start, the TD sing a song... and I ask him to... and he said no !!!! AHHHH I SING BETER THAN YOU !!! <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to sing : " Just comme je partait pour le squatch, avec mon satchel adisas, mes running a valcro, pi mon chandail de mexico, les egout on refouler, la bécosse a déborder, yavais des coliforme fécaux qui flotait sur le téraso. faq jai checker din page jaune, sous la rubrique du plombier, la plomberie amazone, tien donc cé la que je vais appeler. Quand le gars y cé pointer, ya ameuter tout le quartier, son mofleur trainait a terre, ca fesait un boucamp denfert. y cé enfin stationer, avec son éconoline jacker, 2 ton rouiller patcher avec de la potter. ya fouiller en desous de son ban, ya pri son coffre a outil.

<br/>
its the 2 same objective we played at World when Fong beat Max. <br/>
<br/>
Its really a bad luck we are playing each other already :( I know his deck, and he know mine. HE train to 6. The game was boring. He was draining me of 3 on a CC site, And I had bargaining table. He was AFA me. I was Draining for 2 at endor.; and that was it. I had CHYBC to limit his mega retrieval. He needed 1 more force the turn he flip to put a ship at endor and move him to dagoba to retrieve it. So he did not retrieve. And he forgot to take back Jedi test 6.; witch would have made me lost 2 force each turn. FW +15 by.;.. MAX REBO ..; he play like a scrub <br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My Raider Deck VS Alex Klamroth Beat deck starting with Hoth Ice Plain. <br/>
<br/>
First turn, the emperor is at my DB. Then He wasted a monnok. I have a super huge hand to take control of space, but not ground. I put battle plan out. I deploy massively to tattoine System. I grimtash him used, and his hand went from 25 cards to 8.;HUGE .He drop BIHT and ZIMH to carida. I deploy wedge/ship and red5/artoo/palace raider to that system with a cannon. I shot ZIMH. And drew again 6 and 5 for destiny.; the second time and only time I had good random pull :( he lost 15 force or so. Then I beat a lone Chirano on the defensive peremeter to win by 16 <br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My Tie deck Vs Raph Dag deck. <br/>
<br/>
I am quite sure he use no battle ground. So I deploy 9999999 power to endor. And I pay 4 to drain there.; while AFA hit me badly. Boring game. FW +3 <br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My Watch Your Mother Deck VS Nick Frederic Power HDADTJ deck. <br/>
<br/>
The game start, and I got beaten bad.; I am not abel to flip for a long time. I kill 2 vader and 2 tarkin, but still, He got another more. I have lots of power to tattoine system, like 69. I can t hold any battle ground site.; Vader, tarkin and I have you now is huge.Almost all my raider are dead. He had defensive peremeter and Admiral Trawn. We fought a lot. I draw Menace Fade. Ok.; I got 9 card in deck and 3 in hand.; He got 22 in deck and 5 in hand.; I move 2 ship to his kashyyk and drop a raider to my docking bay. I am loosing to his drain in the cantina. And 1 at the defensive peremeter.;. Ok.; I lost rebel barrier.; good.; I move a ship to carida. Now he drain for 3 and he pay. I drain for 1,2,1, and 2 at my bay and I donT pay.;eventually I won by 3 :) I am good in end game. <br/>
<br/>
So I go in the finals. <br/>
<br/>
So they give prices. I won EPP Obi Foil. <br/>
<br/>
So the final start. <br/>
<br/>
Since I am the only 6-0, the TD ask me to chose the side. I said well if I choose DS it will be the most boring game ever seen in a final. So he say well anyways you need to play it, so go for it.; hehehe ok.; it was so boring that everybody left.; but I should have play LS first .; my mistake.; since I did not take the first game seriously and only won by 8 <br/>
<br/>
He play Dagoba with NO Battle ground. <br/>
I play TIE with 3 battleground. <br/>
<br/>
The game start. I get AFA. I got grimtaash for 6 cards. I drain for like 4 turn on the DS docking bay with vader and his stick. He passes jedi test 1 with wedge. So he only looses 8 force per never tell me the odds. 2 NTMTO pop. He don t play ITCBW. I looses to AFA. But now, I have no more odds.; If I activate I looses force, and not him.;So every turn I activated 1, look for a force lightling. So I could see what I had activated. And I said go. He activated 1, move wedge and say go.; after a while, he told me I could play infinitevely.; After a while. I monok him lost for 2 effective repair. I put 50 power to wakelmui, and a POTF. He deploy holoteater and mantelian savrip. I drop CHYBC.;. So.; I won by 8.; <br/>
<br/>
Ok game 2.; His ROPS deck VS My Palace Raider deck. <br/>
<br/>
I had never play against rops.;. I had 2 choice, follow my game plan. Or do as I read on the internet. Try to control Raltir. Usualy my strong point is game plan.;. Not this time. <br/>
<br/>
I said ok.; I will go see him on his planet. He had 2 guys on his forest. And Vader and a walker to his docking bay. With S&amp;D. I drop EPP luke and a patrol craft in front of the 2 fu*k. I slash DS-3 and drew a 1 and a 1 for destiny (EPP luke) (it should have been a 0 since abyss was on table).; It.;s the only time the TD did not remind raph of a card, when raph had forgotten.; I think its stupid.; I mean, the TD should not remind player of cards.; it.;s the player responsibility. I mean sometimes I forgot things, like everybody.; but its my fault, and If I don.;t remind myself, its not the TD responsibility.; anyways he draw a 5 so S&amp;D stay .; I try to control his planet, but I fear monnok so I deploy my raider as fast as I have them. And I can T hold the flip. I can T find talon karde. He draw huge destiny while I draw sh1t. I looses from S&amp;D and AAA and Abys ..;ridiculous.;I get destroy.; FW &amp;#8211;24 <br/>
<br/>
It has been a long time since I had not gotten that badly beat.; I mean, It was chaotic.; I got f*cking destroy, he played very well.; he always had a solution for what I was doing.; congratulation Raphael, If I had to lost to someone, I am happy its my idol. You guys think I am sarcastic ??? NO . Raph is my f*cking idol.; <br/>
<br/>
Yannick told me I had celebration in my starting hand.; I should have retrieve 3 a turn, and drain with my admiral order.; and then IF he had Imperial decree, control his system, and then beat him down solidely at 1 site.; that should have been my game plan.; but I am stupid.; and it s my fault I lost. <br/>
