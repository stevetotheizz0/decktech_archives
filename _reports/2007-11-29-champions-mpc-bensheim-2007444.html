<blockquote><font class="bfont"> [b]Champions' MPC 2007[/b]<br>
[i]Bensheim, Germany[/i]<br>
<br>
I think my TR will be one of the longest reports of this event. Though I really hope it won't be the most boring one. So, lay back and enjoy!:)<br>
<br>
[u][b]Pre-tournament stuff:[/b][/u]<br>
None... just kidding. There were plenty things which I had done, and plenty which I hadn't. As for the start of the whole event we have to go back to end of April, when I competed in German Championship(with more or less success - finished 4th). During lunchtime i've talked with Chris, we had both the same idea. Making an MPC in EU. After a lot of discussion we agreed to have two of them. One in Germany and one in Hungary. The rest is history... Anyway, Nico overestimated my help. I just helped out only with the rankings and seedings. And as far as I see, it was 100% correct, since always the higher seeded player won the match-up.<br>
Let's proceed to step 2. After the initial set-ups i looked for some cheap flight, which I did find @ Ryanair. Andreas offered me one of his rooms agains, which thank again! It's always nice to stay there, always having good conversations!<br>
Step 3: building decks.<br>
Step 4: testing decks - okay, I skipped that. Since I've built my deck just 2 days before the MPC. I've copied Desai's HD and Gemme's WYS - you can look them up here on decktech - and named them Silence! and I KILL YOU! You want to know why? Check [url="http://youtube.com/watch?v=1uwOL4rB-go"]this[/url] out! For day 2 I intended to play Senate for light and AoBS for dark.<br>
Step 5: getting there. It's quite interesting. First I travelled to Budapest to the airport. On the train I wished I could get killed, instead of listening when the woman next to me told her whole life through the phone... Bad start...<br>
Step 6: getting to the airplane. They almost took my cards because of security reasons. Probably, they thought I am smuggling through some dark jedi for money... Crazy. And it wasn't the last time... Also, in Germany they've double checked it on the way back! :)<br>
No more steps. I am in Germany at Hahn. I got a bus to Frankfurt where I had couple of hours, so I did some sightseeing, visiting a Games Workshop shop, and then meeting Nico(Tusken84) at the trainstation where he supposed to arrive by train, but due to strike he came by car. We left for Bensheim, played some(I've beaten Nico's Dark Combat Kart with WYS Spies, then lost to my own deck with HD, but with only 1 card, so that's fine). We had some good Xmas beer, so it was a good day-ending.<br>
<br>
[u][b]Day 1:[/b][/u]<br>
There were only 8 players showing up for qualifications so we let day 2 players to play in the main event, since everyone had the bye. I am sorry if I can't go into much details, I didn't write down anything until now.<br>
<br>
Game 1:<br>
vs. Stefaan's MWYHL<br>
Good start. I got a good player to play against and a tough match-up. I always feared MWYHL, becuase they always could get around my decks. I hoped this time I can do differently. I could set up fastly the following: Lord Vader+Empy with Empy's Power-v and AAA. I flipped the objective ASAP, so he had to deal with many damage, and he had to come down, so my Maul with saber could finish the job. I've won.<br>
<br>
Game 2:<br>
vs. Cristoph's Endor CR-v Tanks - he is the guy who programmed SW:IP. If you haven't sent him a signed card yet, and you're using his program, do send him a card, any card!<br>
Okay. I know his deck, I know that I have to do things fast, which I did. And he had some bad luck with looking for pilots, and my drains at Kessel were too much for him. Also, I could block his drains with UC spies, so the game went on pretty fast. Just before end, he draw up his deck, giving me the FW! Thx.<br>
<br>
Game 3:<br/>
vs. Cedric's TIGIH<br/>
Okay, another match-up I didn't want to see. I just know the key point of this match. He had won 3 battles due to Obi out of play, and he was just about to cross my Vader, when I deployed Emperor Palpy. That screwed up his plans, because he started to play the game in the way he'll win soon, but he was disrupted and AAA, Limited Resources, Visage and drains killed him.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:<br/>
vs. Cedric's EOP<br/>
Again. Just key stuff: i've managed to stay in space for the whole game, put early pressure with draining 3 at Kessel, plus playing Uncontrollable Fury on DVDLOTS. So, won again.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:<br/>
vs. Sibille's Combat<br/>
It seems I get to play against all feared match-ups. MWYHL, TIGIH and now Combat. The problem was that I wasn't expreinced with my deck, and also made some mistakes. Plus, I really didn't care if I win or no. Anyway, I tried to do my best. I've helped out Sibille a couple of times. She still plays a bit clumsy. Sibille never let your feelings drive you. Leaving Empy just because he has beaten you in Combat couple of times, thus giving me a drain of 3, is a no-no. :) But, I guess Angelo will teach you more! :D Anyway, due to a bad destiny draw at Qui costed me the game. But, it was close, and well played from Sibille! I guess she plays her deck for couple of months...<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:<br/>
vs. Sibille's EOPS<br/>
That's the match-up WYS cannot win. She could move around control phase with BS Fleet, I never draw high enough to get Boba, BH off the table so slowly she overwhelmed me. At the end I could turn the tide, but we run into time, and she got more cards. I gave her a FW! Very good match!<br/>
<br/>
This was day 1, I qualified as 2nd, which was good since I went to Nico's branch, which I thought that would be easier... On the next day it turned out that I play in Angelo's, so that sucked, since I prepared for other things... :(<br/>
After playing 6 games, we decided to go to some cool italian restaurant where we had some great dinner(no junk foods, sorry :P ). Sibille, Angelo, Stefaan, Andreas and I talked a lot. We discussed some about why Reid scrubbed at worlds, what should be our decks the next day, and why 5+8+9 25. Poor waiter... Anyway, we hurried home later, since we had some things to do... Like decks. After lot of thinking I decided to take the same decks, with some small modifications(which worked really nice, but didn't helped me too much...)<br/>
<br/>
[u][b]Day 2:[/b][/u]<br/>
Hm, after arriving we had to re-do the whole brackets, since some didn't show up - due to illnes or strikes. And here I had to oppose the fact I'll play Angelo if I go through round 1. Bad news!<br/>
<br/>
[i]Round 1:[/i]<br/>
Game 1<br/>
vs. Stefan's Hoth CR-v Walkers<br/>
It was quick. Since I had a god set-up, compared to his unlucky draw. Anyway, I have to mentioned that it was 2nd tournament, so he still learning. I tried to help him, and after the game we could talk some about his deck. Fw by 20s I think.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
vs. Stefan's Endor CP-v Ewoks<br/>
I flipped fast, and kept my objective flipped. Killed Luke with Elis-Sniper combo, then in a few battles I killed some Ewoks so I didn't have to lose cards from Reserve deck. The game went to time, and I got the TW about 20.<br/>
<br/>
So, I went through and had to play Angelo... While I was having a break tried to prepare myself for the match.<br/>
<br/>
[i]Round 2:[/i]<br/>
Game 1<br/>
vs. Angelo's BHBM<br/>
Angelo and I knew that this is the game where all will be decided. If I can win or lose by a little my HD will crush his QMC. I set up fast with Luke to Kessel, and was looking to go for Nightfall/spy set up on Tatooine. Meanwhile, he played Empy, set up S&amp;D, Vader, and controlled Cantina. And he was the only player who played Comer Here You Big Coward out against me the whole weekend. So, my retrieval was cancelled. I was fine until the stupid move of playing Nightfall without flipping my objective(which i wanted to do anyway this turn...), so he had a chance to cancel it with Alter(EP1), from then on I was making mistakes after mistakes. I gave Luke to Vader so he lost some force + lost S&amp;D which was retrieved later and played again. I think he won by 15. Which made the 2nd game even more interesting...<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
vs. Angelo's QMC<br/>
It was a fun and interactive game where I always had the lead, I think both of us played without mistakes. It would have been interesting if we can play it out. When the time was called i had about 25 lifeforce while he had only about 15 and only Leia on ground. And I had Lord Vader + Emperor Palpatine on 2 sites. Because of time, I was out... Anyway, that was one of the best games of the weekend, I hope we can play again in the future. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After I was out, I ordered some stuff to eat - don't ask the name, I don't remember -, then played 2 games. One against Sibille - lost -, and one against Ralf - won. But I was a bit confused after being dropped, so couldn't really focus on these games. Finishing 4th in side event meant I got 2 boosters(Dagobah limited, JP), oversized Aurra and poster which I gave to Stefan, and a sealed Asteroid Sanctuary. Unfortunately, no random Empy to me... :( As I had to go to airport I couldn't watch the finals. I hope both Angelo and Nico enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
[u][b]After-tournament stuff:[/b][/u]<br/>
We departed from Bensheim at 7pm, arrived at the airport at 10pm. Usually, it takes 1 hour. We got lost due to talking about Ewoks and missing one of the exits. Anyway, this way I saw some of rural Germany, and talked about life, sw, wines. I want to thank Jörg for taking me there, and I am sorry that the trip home was way longer than planned. Next time I'll try to take a navigation system with me. :)<br/>
