<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"> Well, me and the rest of Team Machine started proxying up decks about a week before Death Star II came out. We had all decided that Ralltiir Ops would be the Dark Side deck we would play so that was no question, but we were all pretty much split on Light Side. I was sure testing was the best deck, if it was made with Ralltiir in mind. Charlie came up with an uber-cool Falcon deck that started the new objective, there is good in him. Wesley ignored the Light Side all together and threw some crap deck together at the last minute, and Clay decided to copy Charlie's Super Falcon.dec. Charlie had no faith in flipping Mind What You Have Learned so he never really gave it much thought. We decided to add the docking bay, IAO, mobilization start to ralltiir, and we added a few more imperials, and an extra ship. The Ralltiir deck was very solid.<br/>
<br/>
 We left Wesley's house at about 1:00AM in a Van the Machine himself had borrowed from his uncle (dubbed the Tantive M). The drive was uneventful, except for a flat, with much music, and few stops. We arrived in Jacksonville with about an hour and a half to spare. On to the games<br/>
<br/>
Dark Side - A ROps deck me and Charlie put through some abuse that included Docking Bays, Mobilization Points, and Sarkli, god of 2/2 scrubs.<br/>
<br/>
Light Side - A Test all the way to 6 deck with no 6's or 7's that tracks a 5 for test 5 and uses good cards where everybody else has horseshi.t 7's.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - My DS vs. A newer player's Visored Vison MWYHL<br/>
This game starts off bad as he kills my scrub at the DS II docking bay with 2 eloms and joreon webb. I loose the guy ang like 6 cards. I'm not activating huge, but he gives me some icons so I hard flip 4-5th turn, which is no good, but I had a horrible start. He moves the eloms from the Death Star to Ralltiir in front of a walker to go with the 3 other Eloms he deployed that turn. I move to the desert and hope he follows because I'm holding Sandwhirl. If he did that I figured I would win because I had caught his first visored vision, altered the coupling with lord vader and a 1, and that would wipe out every character he had on the board. He does indeed follow, and since he had no controls, I lay the whirl, search and destroy, and Ability^3 and just wait for him to die.<br/>
FW by 17<br/>
2(+17)<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Sandwhirling 5 Eloms<br/>
Lows - Getting the guy at the docking bay kicked to the curb.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - My Ls vs. A semi-newer player's Hunt Down<br/>
I start Wise Advice, The Way Of Things, and Your Insight Serves you Well. He did not start Imperial Arrest Order so I'm hoping he doesn't get a good site draw so that he looses to visage for a few turns. After he activates one I put the Insight in my lost pile to go get Honor Of The Jedi. All he does is draw up the first turn so we both loose one to visage. He looses Tarkin from hand so I Out of Commission for the 50/50 chance and score Tarkin. This is good. I train really fast starting on turn 3 with test 1, turn 4 for test 2 and 3, turn 5 for test 4 and flip on turn 7. I It Could Be Worse a drain of 2 at one point, and he It's Worses it so we get into an slight disagreement where I tell him he can't make me lose extra force so we call a judge, and luckily the judge is well informed so I only lose the It Could Be Worse and the 2 from the drain. He doesn't get sites for about 3 turns so he has lost about 6 to his own visage and I have lost none. He assumes I have very few characters and draws up to the 3 battle grounds he needs putting Mara at one, Vader at one, and Sim Aloo and Janus at the other. I frozen Assets his pile, play Obi at Mara's sight, and Luke at Janus and Sim's sight. I attack and Weapon Levitate Mara's Saber and beat her down making him lose her and 2 cards. He drew a 4 so I have to lose Obi also. I attack Sim and Janus with Luke, hit Sim and He only draws a 3 so Luke stays because of test 3 and Yoda at the Hut. His objective stays on the 0 side and drain with Luke, retriev with On the Edge, and make him lose to visage while I hide behind Honor, which is a terribly broken card.<br/>
FW +37<br/>
4(+50)<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Honor of the Jedi being so damn good.<br/>
Lows - Me and Charlie were both 4(+50). Bad m'kay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - My DS vs. Charles M. Herren, TIGIH - Super Falcon<br/>
A game I should lose about 1 out of every 10 games, where the one game I should win is when I have Sarkli on the draw. Well my firts eight cards include Sarkli and Ozzel so I put them both at Chief Chirpa's Hut. So Charlie's objective flips and I loose 2 at the end of my turn like a champ, but Charlie goes from activating 7 to activating 4. If he doesn't have Kessl or Kiffix in his hand this could be ugly. Charlie basically plays 142,746,879 red cards, including Honor of the Jedi so I can't drain him at the Hut, and starts drawing. I don't do much on my second turn, but I had drawn 2 &lt;&gt; sites so I don't have to pull them, so I keep the force choke on for a while. I also loose 2 at the end of this turn like a champ. Charlie doesn't do much again and just draws a few cards. He's the best. On my third turn I expect to flip, but when I search for a docking bay I see there is a Vader in my force pile so I just lose 2 and draw for him. Charlie does the draw - go thing again, but he has been pulling 1/0 docking bays so he is doing a little better. I basically just play Vader and flip my objective with Tempest 1 and a pilot at the desert, Mara at the Jungle, and a 2/2 (Godherdt I believe) at the prefects office. Charlie pulls the &lt;&gt; docking bay and shows me Captain Han to go get then Falcon and puts them both at the &lt;&gt; docking bay. He asks me to show him barrier so I do and he catches it. He lets me go so I just drain at the Hut and search for a card. I only have  5 or so card hand so my options are limited so I pull Janus to try and take out Han. I drop Janus hoping for the handshake, but Charlie shows me barrier. Awesome. I then deploy Generic Tempest Scout and attempt a trample, but draw a 3. I just walk the Scout over to Mara's sight and let Charlie play the game. He still hasn't drawn Kessel so he decides to get aggressive and deploys Leia to the Hut to fight Vader, Sarkli, Ozzel, and another 2/2 scrub. I take my action and Monnok him lost netting two Obi's with Saber and 2 On the Edges. Huge. He only has Melas as another character so he deploys it and fights. He tracked a 6 for the destiny to shoot Vader, and draws well for destiny. He has to loose both and a few cards, but Luke transfers to Sarkli and I will be loosing to the objective. He finally gets Kessel so we start a drain race. He's hitting me for 2 and the 2 from the objective, and I'm draining him for 4-5 and he is loosing 2 to ability, ability, ability. He does his last on the edge for 5 I believe and he keeps it close and I win the race by 2. Phew! That was a hella game, and I still lub you man.<br/>
FW +26(+52)<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Monnok for 2 Obi's and 2 On the Edges.<br/>
Lows - Beating Charlie (sort of a low :P)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - My LS vs. Clay Cushman  Court of Big Beats<br/>
He starts off by pulling Mara and her saber to the chamber, which is why I love giving my opponent 2 force to start the game. I draw Daughter, which is bad I would learn in a bit. I started insight agiain so I could hide behind Honor the entire game. I get Yoda and his hut first turn since I also drew the 1st, 3rd, and 5th test. He drains for 2 and I lose a couple of cards from hand. A landing claw and something else. He deploys the Hoth: Ice Plains and lets me go. I deploy Daughter and the first test and just draw up. He drains for 2 again and that is starting to suck, and he deploys the Endor: Dark Forest and I start to sweat, but he begins to draw. I pass the test and by now have all the test in hand with the Training Area and signal for a projection. I put it at Mara's site and buy myself a bit of breathing room. He eventually deploys Boba Fett and another alien to the Endor site. He has 18 or so cards in hand so I reduce his threats to 8 with Grimtaash and decide to start attacking him now even though I am only on test 3. I attack and steal Mara's saber and kill her, and I also attack and kill Boba Fett and the other alien at endor. He draws low so my Luke stays at endor, but he drew well enough to kill the Ben that attacked Mara. He looses one to his Objective and draws some threats. I drain at the Endor site, start up on test 4 and track an out of commision to use for that and the 5th test. He lays a big beatdown crew to the Endor site including big walkers. but I draw well and he draws a three so Luke stays again. I draw the 5 for test 4, but don't have but 1 card left in the reserve so I just deploy Obi and Han along with Order to Enagage and let him go. He clashes Luke and attacks and I have to loose both Obi and Han because he hit Han but he looses a bunch also because I drew good destiny. I start test 5 and search for a card, and let him go. By now he has Jabba at the Cantina so I It could be worse the damage and he catches. I finish test 5 with a 5, but learn that since I deployed Leia from hand I don't flip. I also reinforced Luke with Han, put Obi in front of Jabba who is now at the great pit in a walker, and attack at each. I clear both locations with good destiny, and then draw the 5 for test 5. For the rest of the game I drain him and retrieve with On the Edge.<br/>
FW +30<br/>
8(+82)<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Being aggressive with a Test to 6 deck<br/>
Lows - Beating a very nice player.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 - My DS vs. Ben Mathews   X-Wing SpamIf I had known what he was playing this would have been a much better game than it turned out to be. The game starts off normally as we both pull sites and systems, and we both activate a ton. The first few turns are really uneventful as he deploys many systems and put a few x-wings at Kiffix. I hard flip on about the 4th turn with walkers and such, and the true game begins. He pulls his coruscant and kessel and puts 2 x-wings at each and flips pretty soon after I do. I can only drain for one now, so I decide to probe as quickly as possible. I use the devestator and Zuckus to probe, and I am pretty sure it is dantooine because all the other syatems are battle grounds. I use monnok netting 0 cards but see no barriers so decide to deploy one to Kashyyk, and one to Aqualis I think. I probe Kashyyyk just in case. I also probe Aqualis with Zuckus because there was no reason not to. I collapsed them both to Dantooine. I probe on his turn and its right, but he has bought himself 3 turns by canceling 2 of my drains, and he is now draining me for 5. He ends up shooting Zuckus and making me lose the Devastator, but that Ok. He only has 2 ships at each drain 2 location so I decide to go after the drain at caruscant with bossk and passangers, but it goes bad when he plays You over estimate our chances and power pivot. I have to lose the pasenger and I don't want to leave Bossk in the air so I just loose him as well. I use Search and Destroy and drain for 4 to catch up to him, but when things start looking close, he retrieves about 7 with All Wings and puts back 6 ships with two squadrons. I end up being drained out a few turns later. If I had know he played zero character I would have just flipped with three AT-St pilots and gone to space hard, but I played it like it was a balanced deck, and made some horrible mistake, and pretty much deserved to lose. <br/>
FL -20<br/>
8(+62)<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Probing 3 turns after he flipped<br/>
Lows - Playing poorly and putting so many dudes on the ground at ralltiir.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6- My LS vs. The Neal Razi playing Big Blue<br/>
He starts Death Star so I get to go first, and I'm in no hurry to test yet, so I just pull Yoda's Hut and Yoda to match his activation for awhile. He goes and plays the Endor: Forest Clearing and draws up. I go get Daughter and test one and go ahead and start that junk up. Thats about all I do that turn, but I do draw a landing claw to go with the Red leader in my hand. His 2nd turn he plays Vader to the Endor 2/1 site and puts a Dune Walker and Igar at the Backdoor. Not good. I finish first test, and projection the 2/1 site so he's only hitting me for 2, and he has to pay for it so I'm ok for now. I also signal for and play Fury on Vader so we are both loosing two a turn. Needless to say he is upset and a bit rattled. Third turn Fury is horribly, horribly wrong. I just go about my testing. He just pays to drain searches his deck with something to check for systems in his force pile I believe, and he draws up and looses 2. I do the 2nd test and put the 3rd one at the jungle, but for the first time today somebody moved it, and like a pro, Neal cost me a turn. He actually alters the Projection I played by drawing a system, so I play another, and he alters it also. Man I can't wait to get test 4 done. Luckily I started Wise Advise so I can get them back later. He finally finds a system and puts a couple of star destroyers there, but he didn't pay for drains this turn. I finish test 3 and put out the gold leader I had drawn and landing claw. He drains for 2 for free which is very bad, and plays Godherdt (any characters whose name has God and Hurt in it is obviously good) and cancels the claw during  his move phase. I pass the 4th test and search for a card. I take an Out of Commission to track for the 5th test and move Gold Leader to Dagobah. He drains for 4, which is horrible, but he only gets one turn of that so I'm Ok. I track the 5 four or so cards deep, put Luke and Han in front of the Walker and Igar and attack. I draw well so he looses both, and the pol treidum he had outside to provide ability, and thats taken care of, but I lose Han and hope he can't come after Luke hard. He drains for 2 in space and deploys kashyyy and puts Boba Fett and Zuckus there. He moves Vader and 3 walkers in fron of Luke. I play Lando in Falcon, Red Leader and Melas in front of Boba and Zuckus, keeping up with the 5 I'll need for the test at the end of my turn. I attack and he only has to lose Zuckus, and I lose Red Leader. I had been abusing Frozen Assets all this time like a little girl, and was keeping him where he didn't have a massive amount of force to use. I decided to move Gold Leader to help Lando instead of running with Lando. Needless to see he Lateral Damaged Lando and played the Chimera to go with Boba Fett and a random pilot to get destiny I believe. He attacked and I drew the 5 on test 5 for power of 9 and he drew endor. Visibly upset he lost the pilot, and I lost everything but Lando in Falcon. I had order to engage out so I had left Han, Luke, and Obi in front of Vader and 3 big walkers, but he had no force left to battle so he lost 5 cards, 3 to order, 2 to fury. The 10 cards I got back were two of the frozen assets so I abused those some more, actaully attacking and killing vader and everything but one of the walkers on the ground. I also moved Lando to Dagobah with the intention of landing him next turn. He drained me for three in space, while I played all three of my On the Edges for 12 cards (they got placed out of play because of the effect Leave them to me, I believe it is called). He walks the walker over and looses 3 to order to engage. I beat the last remaining walker down with Orrimarko and move him with Luke and Han (Obi died in the Battle with vader). He has little force left, but grabs my It Could Be Worse, and pays to drain for 3 in the air. I drain for 3 at his endor site (precsence of the force). and play test 6 when his hand is empty to force him to loose 2 at the begining of my turns. On my last turn he has 8 cards left so I do the 2 from test 6, drain for 3 and return leia to my hand to go along with the claw I was holding. I land Lando in the swamp to wash off the lateral damage and put him back in my deck. He drains me for 2 and I lose the landing claw and Leia from my hand and drain him for the rest of his cards. <br/>
FW +20<br/>
10(+82)<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Getting to play Neal<br/>
Lows - Causing him such distress with 3rd turn Fury, sorry Neal.<br/>
<br/>
