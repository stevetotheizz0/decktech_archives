<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">okay, This is my TR from the Tuesday night Mirkwood Tourney.  I went with a Twix Mains and Toys for the LS, and a SYCFA Big Blue for the dark side.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my LS vs. Herb Macy’s Court of the Chubby Gangster.  Okay this worried me, because Herb is a decent player, and I generally don’t do well against Court (I like to play a bit too aggressivly, and usually get stomped by it).  So turn 1 he puts down Mighty Jabba.  My turn I get Lando on the old School Falcoln at Rp, Pull Endor and the Home 1 DB with Insurrection and HB and move falcoln to Endor, notice that when I was rebuilding this deck I forgot to put Crix back in, uh....oh, I play with about 5 guys who Crix can pull, and this could hurt me.  I lose 1 to court and let Herb go, he activates, draws a couple, saves a couple.  My turn I activate, and draw, trying to find some more characters, lose 1 to court.  Herb activates, deploys Zuckuss against Lando, battle, he draws a 1, he loses 1 force.  my turn, I activate drop a bothan Spy, and Han w/ Gun to Carkoon, and move Lando to the RP, draw.  Now Herb is hurting, cause he is only getting 5 force per turn, and he can’t find any of his sites.  a few turns go by with us draining each other, and drawing, till I get Tantive 4 and Spiral into my hand, plus Master Luke, and Obi w/ stick.  I deploy Tantive to RP, and move Lando and Tantive to endor, save force.  Herb deploys IG-in Ship to endor, says good you only have 5 ability and battles, REACT, spiral comes down, and rids space of IG-88, he draws 2 4’s for BD,so the tantive goes.  My turn, blount gets on the spiral, and luke and obi come down to the AC.  Battle at the AC, miss on a choke Boelo back to hnd, hit Boelo, hit Ephant mon, he misses on Hidden Weapons with Jodo, obi, dies, and is captured, boelo, and EM die.  His turn, he deploys 4-Lom w/ gun.  Battle I hti Jodo Kast, he points at luke, I draw a 5 for BD, he kills and captures Luke, but Obi is now free, 4-lom take s luke to jail.  My turn, I use 4 force to cancel S&amp;V, then battle at Endor, he loses Zuckuss and like 5 force, I then move Obi into the dungeon, and free Luke.  I now have control of Tatooine.  He started to lose from his objective, He did come down one more time, and killed obi, but died a horrible death for his trouble.  Full win by 16<br/>
<br/>
Now my DS v.s Graham Neal’s deadbolt with lots more ships.  This was a short and ugly game, he came after all my Star Destroyers, with matching pilots, and in the end cleared me out of space.  Graham used Ketwol very effeectively, and used On the Edge 2 times (placed out of play from something special) And his matching pilots swarm was too much for my ISD’s to take.  FL by 21<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 my LS vs. Josh (my new favorite whippin’ boy) Grace, and his Carbon Chamber Testing Deck.<br/>
<br/>
I gave hiun LT. Stoo’Vees (can’t hurt me from Aiii, Aiii, Aggg) and the game began.  Josh put out Djas, and Myo, and moved lt. Stoo, to the Carbonite chamber on about turn 3.  Then I came down with Lando, and Obi,w/stick.  Battle, chop Djas, kill Myo, and Djas, lose obi, move Stoo and Lando to the DB.  Draw.This game got pretty intense ’cause Josh doesn’t take kindly to the comments I’ve made on DeckTech about how I can beat him any time any place:).  After Lando and Stoo drained him at the DB for a turn, he came down with Mara, Dr. E and Ree Yees, battle,chop Stoo, assinate, and I lose Lando he covers, move all 3 into the CC.  I deployed Luke JK and Han w/ Gun to the AC to take on Mighty Jabba and Ephant Mon, used Chock on Jabba cause his destinys were high enough that had he drawn 2 he could have killed Luke and I didn’t want that.  Battle, ,Luke and Han killed everything, but Han died an honorable death in the process.  So now I am pretty confident, I own the AC with Luke JK and saber,  and enodor with Home 1, battle plan is hurting him now.  His turn, he Freezes Lando WTF? and I lose 8 force, now that just made it closer, and he starts moving him to wards the AC.  He also deploys Zuckuss and Bossk t6o take on Home 1, I react with spiral, to soak up the BD, and add soem power.  My turn I deploy DoS to the AC and give her a saber, and deploy Cpt. Han to the Hoth DB, transit to Home 1 DB, then move into becoming a pilot.  now I have ability 7 there.  His turn he battles at endor, draw 4,2 haha, I’m immune, I draw a 5 a bossk Dies, he moves Mara Dr. E and Ree Yees to tat. DB.  my turn, drain, battle at endor, draw another 5 zuckuss dies, space is again mine.  His turn, he deploys Jodo Kast to the AC, and moves the 3 musketeers to join him.  My turn I battle, use Luke to target Mara, hit, he plays hidden weapons on luke, captured, Leia targets Jodo, hit, draw a 2 for BD, he loses Dr. E. and the 2 hit guys, I lose Leia, and a cou[ple force, but Luke is free.  He moves Ree Yees, to the Dungeon, and retrieves 2 force.  My turn I drain and move Luke to the jail, to try and free Lando, and place his objective out of play, he runs like a scared little whore.  I free Lando.  move them both back to the AC. He deploys another guy and battles me, I lose Lando, he loses both guys, to finish this very long game report, he kept throwing guys at me, and finally killed Luke, but none of his guys ever survived, I then deployed Orimarkko, and drained him out.  full win by 6<br/>
<br/>
Last game vs. Tyler and his hiddeen scouts.<br/>
This game was not very interesting, he tried to come to space, and got squished, and it became a drain race, but my ways of cancelling a few of his (always thinking with your stomach and Tarkin’s orders) and Chirneau and 4 systems with ISD’s drained him out in space.  A few battle did take place, he came down and tried to take over the Death Star, with Cracken in Tala 1 and Lanod in Gold 1.  Next turn came down Exec. with a pilot, battle, he loses cracken and ship,  then flys to Kashyyk with Lando.  Lando is then jumped by a Death Squadron SD with a pilot, and that took him out of spoace until the end.  At the end of the game he flipped HB and deployed home 1 to Kessel.  I played Lateral Damamge, and moved Zuckuss there.  he moved Home 1 to try and cancel LD, but failed.  I just killed him then, but only after I probed his HB, and got 5 cards back into my used pile.  Full win by 16<br/>
