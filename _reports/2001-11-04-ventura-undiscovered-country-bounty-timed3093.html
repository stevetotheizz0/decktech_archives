The Ventura tournament AKA (Undiscovered country) <br/>
<br/>
Pre tournament material:<br/>
<br/>
Decided to attend this tournament at the Ventura because of its prizes and high volume of people. Plus, it  was a bounty tournament.  We left for the tournament 1-hour earlier to do some shopping and trading for cards. We got to the store at 11:00. No one was there expect the shop owners and the few customers. I traveled with the palmdale pimps who are Ed, josh, James and terry. So, after few minutes of waiting for people we went to refill our Carl&amp;#8217;s JR drinks. After few minutes of agony we found Carl&amp;#8217;s JR and got our refills. When we came back, CAT (who is the tournament director) was getting setup and getting ready to trade. He showed his maul with sticks (the bastard {j/k} had three of them) foils he started to trade. <br/>
<br/>
The tournament:<br/>
<br/>
We had 14 people showed up to the tournament. Cat said &amp;#8220;he had 20 at least but few had problems, so bounty are me and Sean.&amp;#8221;  Which was cool. We got started.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
<br/>
Ed&amp;#8217;s ISB Vs my Yavin 4 blow up the death star<br/>
<br/>
I knew this sucked before it began. I built that deck just last night. I put it together. Plus I traveled @#$% loads of miles to play someone who is 5 minutes away from my house&amp;#8230; great&amp;#8230;  So he starts with Imperial Square and three normal effects. He deployed docking bays first few turns. I activated and drew the half of my activation every turn. I had a good beefy hand. Then in four rounds he deploy zukuss to the Yavin with ig-88 2000 and Vader with probe druids to docking bay. I activate and deploy home one to Yavin 4 with Luke scout and general Lando and intimate battle. I won the battle by 6 and he lost zukuss and one card. That move, made ig88-2000 invisible and safe from another beat down. I moved Luke and Lando go docking bay to go after Mr. Vader.  He activated and deployed ozzel, two battle druids. Battles. He drew 4 and I drew a red 6 for battle destiny. I kill few druids and he kills Lando. He moves to war room for more protection.  I activated and drain for one at the Yavin system. Then I unload my hand. Obi with saber, Leia with the gun and Han with gun and intimate the battle. Leia shoot the probe druid. Han hit another probe druid and obi hit Vader and that was it. He lost all and 8 cards of the top. That was the game. I drain him for 5 in systems and his docking bays for 4 and it was over in 6 turns. Win by 14<br/>
2 (14)<br/>
The good: Knew what he had<br/>
The bad: This deck had good destinies but he never drew of them. The Ghkks never came to his hand. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
<br/>
WOW    Ed blow up the bunker (again) Vs my corusant tie deck <br/>
<br/>
This game was over before it was called. I retrieve everything I lost and he never did anything. I made him lose the bunker of the top with the senators and drain him at Endor and in corusant.  That was the whole game. He could not drain me at Endor because of the spies and controlling Endor never able to flip the objective. It was over.  Win by 22<br/>
<br/>
4 (36)<br/>
<br/>
The good: won another game<br/>
The bad: He drew up the cards before I can retrieve. Damm<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 <br/>
<br/>
Sean dueling dark side Vs Light Yavin deck<br/>
<br/>
This was a weird game. I did not know anything about the new objectives. I had to asking to explain it to me. He started with three effects and defense shields. He deployed Maul with saber in the beginning to the generator in first turn and said go. I deploy a site and left my force there. Next thing I knew I was been drain for 3 there. What the heck, three lost by second turn. Wow. I lost of the top of the reserve deck. Nothing improvement. He left his force there and said go. I activated deployed the next site for Yavin and deploy there pilots and flipped. A quick flip for Yavin which was cool. I thought. I said go. He activated and deployed Vader to Naboo with a stick and a dueling card. He said go. I was looking at the next for drain of 6 at naboo. Not good. But I no clue about deploying a Jedi to naboo stop all force drain there. SO with my stupendous I deployed obi one to Yavin war room for protection and take the lost on it. Deployed death star and naboo system to empty my zero out of my deck. I said go. He activated; he drained, and deployed p59 and p 60 to Vader place and Ellis to war room and battled. He beat the @#$% out of guys there with shooting and the battle attrition of 6. That battle I lost 10 cards and any person on table. Not good. He said go. I activated and deployed home one with a pilot to Yavin. I thought I was safe. He activated and drains for 7 and deployed executor with admiral Thrawn with sucks and battles. He drew 14 for attrition and kicked my ass. Not good. I lost home and the lone pilot. He lost zckuss. That was game. He just drained me out.<br/>
Fl 0 (23)<br/>
<br/>
4 (13)<br/>
The good: I learned that sending a Jedi to Naboo kills their drains<br/>
The bad: Lost home one in space. What a luck.<br/>
<br/>
Overall it was learning experience. Sean is a cool guy. We talking after the game, about the new strategies and went out side to smoke. He told me to how to deal with the new dark side dueling decks.  <br/>
<br/>
Game four<br/>
<br/>
Josh cloud city mining Vs my senate deck<br/>
<br/>
This game was not that interesting. Seriously, no joke. He never deployed any body to ground in till end of the game. I controlled the bespin and used the senator game texts to the max. I made him lose the top of the reserve pile to kill him. He finally got courage after the 6 round to deploy to all sites to drain me out. But I was draining for 10 a turn and it was over.  Fl (14) I over deployed, major mistake<br/>
<br/>
6 (27)<br/>
The good: Nothing. He thought I had a bomb hand so he did nothing in till the end.<br/>
The bad: Beating down another palmdale person.<br/>
<br/>
After the fourth game, Cat decided to end the tournament for few people. He came down here with couple of friends and they had to be at work by 7:00. But after few minutes, We decided to bug him to play six. The people called work and said they were going to be late by 20 minuets. Thank you for those people<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game five<br/>
<br/>
My light side Vs some guys new dueling deck<br/>
<br/>
This game was over before it got stared. He just controlled Naboo and drains me there in till I deployed obi and Luke. Then he duels me out with Vader. My destinies were great but he had duel cards ready for me. Fl 24 again<br/>
<br/>
6 (3)<br/>
<br/>
The good: I now I need a new deck<br/>
The bad: My deck. <br/>
<br/>
Game six<br/>
<br/>
My dark side Vs (forgot your name sorry) light side dueling deck, this guy is 5-0 and looking to sweep the tournament. <br/>
<br/>
This game was longest game of the day. Every move was tripling checked and precise. <br/>
He was playing light side dueling with a beat down squad. First turn I had 3 senators and 3 ties and 2 interrupts that pulls sites out. I deploy a senator to senate and got Naboo and deployed. I said go with 2 force remain. He activated and looks at my senators and drew up all of it. I knew he had 15 cards in his so I was looking for the drop (I think that is what it is called for the dark side). Before I activated and grab waulekiem system and then I activated and drain him for one and deployed two more senators and a tie to corusant system and used the senator to make him lose the top card of his reserve deck. That made him think twice about his destinies. Now I flip the objective and grab the political effect and deployed. I left one force in the force pile to make him feel like I had a ghkk in hand. He activated and deployed corusant docking bay, and squadron assignment for dash. He deployed him and general Lando with it for easy for drain. He thought he was safe. He said go. I activated and right before I drain him he deployed battle order from the cheese starting effects. I paid for it and put the pressure on him. I use the senators to make him lose the top card to reserve deck and that was seriously wounded him. It was a seven. I drew all but one. Now I had a good hand. Two all power to weapons, lateral damage, emperors shield, another senator and presence of the force, drop. Wow, only thing I needed was a ghkk and sinear fleet and I was set.  I said go. He activated and drains me for two at kiffexs and I used the senator to stop at. Then, he deployed young Obi one to Naboo with saber, Luke with saber there. Also to corsuant docking bay, Leai with blaster, yoda and corran horn and then his biggest mistake ever move the ships to corusant. He said go. I activated and look at my hand for a good one-minute. Then I look at him and said, let me see your top card. It was an another seven so made it go bye bye. I did not drain him. I lost the all power to weapons to grab three ties and deployed them. Drop the lateral damage on outrider and drooped shield to say hi. He was worried like crap. No power and one destiny. I initiated the battle and used the all power to weapons and hit him for 28-force loss. That was the game. I drain him out and he drains me much as possible. Senators because much more powerful than he expected. Unfortunately I over deployed and that cost me the big win. I also needed bright center of the universe or imperial decree for this deck. Only thing that is missing in this power house deck. <br/>
Fl 5<br/>
<br/>
8 (8) was kind of differently is this. I never got lower than 20 in my life. Don the destroyer needed some serious @#$% kick soon. So I finished 4-2 overall in fourth place. Which was awesome. But lost the bounties because of my hard head. Next time they will be that and mine is a guaranteed.<br/>
<br/>
Got 3 reflection, 3 tats, and 3 corusant which was more than any other tournaments I have in been in years. <br/>
