<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well it was a very, very long trip to Las Vegas from my house, but hey I got to play Star Wars.  I left Thursady afternoon. (The 4th)  I actually went with Matt Reicks from Denver, CO.  I live in Colorado Springs.  We had been invited to stay at Dayel's (Conklin) house.  He lives in Provo, Utah.  It was a little out of the way, but it gave us a way to break the trip into two parts.  It kind of sucked because the Provo area includes like 4 towns and we got lost for over an hour.  So we left friday morning, and reached Las Vegas by about 4:30.  I was supposed to stay with Mike Girard and his AZ cronies.  Mike showed up around 6.  When he got there we found out that he didn't even have a reservation.  PERFECT! No where to stay.  Eventually we got a room at the Maxium, where it cost alot more.  I called downstairs for a wake up call at 8:30 because i am going to play YJ bofore SW. Then I go to sleep in between a bed and the wall with only a pillow and no blanket.  I wake up at about 8:00 because Mike sounds like a chainsaw when he sleeps.  This was actually lucky because they forgot to do the wakeup call.  <br/>
<br/>
I get to the hotel that the tournaments are at about 30 minuites before the tournament.  I was actually looking forward to YJ because i had won my state championship and thought i could win this too.  (I am gonna make this brief because i know most of you don't care about YJ.)  There was me and the AZ state YJ champions present, so the director decided to put a bounty on us.  Anyone who beat us got a pack of cards.  <br/>
I started off 3-0 and i was in first place.  Cool.  Then i was pummeled by tanks. 3-1.  won another, and then smack, tanks again.  So i finished 4-2, and had fun.  This was just an appitiser for the main event.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't believe how many people were in attendance.  Like 52.  It was nuts.  I only knew a few people.  I knew Matt, because i came with him.  Conklin, because i stayed at his house.  Lafferty, from D-con.  Finally Girard, and his buddies from alot of tournaments.  Before i start i will have to say that i am VERY bad with names and don't think i can remember a single one.  I was playing me version of TRM, and Endor ops.  I had talked to Hayes Hunter over AIM and he convinced me to put some things in my Endor Ops.  I would post my decks, but i was told that there is going to be an extensive report here on decktech about the Vegas GS that will include the top 6 player's decks.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 1- My endor ops vs. a tosche mains deck.<br/>
<br/>
HOLY CRAP!  This game riled me up.  I never had any control over the game.  Basically 2 things cost me the game.  I had a dreadnaught at the D* draining using Omnious Rumors.  He hit me with the tantive, spiral, and some EPPS. I lost the dread and some.  Then i never took back the D*.  I got drained hard.  I had to do something so i moved out of the bunker for a small drain.  That is when i was bent over for a second time.  EPP slaughter, and i lost more cards.  So i lost by alot.  I haven't lost by alot in a VERY long time.  I think it was for the better though.  I need one of these beatings ever once and a while to keep my ego in check.  Although I guarantee I'm not going to play that deck ever again.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My TRM vs. a COTVG deck.<br/>
<br/>
This was a quick one.  I took over tatooine and drained all game long.  Every time he played some thing, i beat it up.  It was a flashback from game 1, except i was in the driver's seat.  One plus for him was that Obi was eaten by the Rancor.  I won by alot.  It put me around 2(+0)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My endor Ops vs. a fake HB tatooine ground deck.<br/>
<br/>
This game my endor ops set up well.  I had ephont mon in the bunker and a big drain in space.  Although he did hit me with the super falcon i had no problem dealing with it.  I put a lateral damage on it, and hit it hard.  He lost everything and some.  I won by like 20.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My TRM vs. a CCT deck.<br/>
<br/>
This was a suprise.  I actually have never played against CCT in a tournament.  So my first plan was to free chewie. (the rebel i gave him before the game)  It was sucessful.  I expected him to hit me with alot of characters all game long.  It just never happened.  I owned ground all game long.  It was a good game.  I won by like 20 again.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 my endor ops vs. Brian Garrison's TRM<br/>
<br/>
He played a @#$%load of the twix sites.  He was activating a million right away.  First i put ephont and tarkin in the bunker.  Then he puts EPP han and Luke at the docking bay.  WOW!, this means so Cpt. han killing me in space.  I put down U-3po and killed his drain of 1.  Then he grimnocks me for 2 bossk in busses and 2 masterful moves.  From there on out it was a space fight.  I play with an abnormal amount of ships.  He really never stood a chance, especially with the lateral damage on the falcon.  FW by a moderate amount.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 my TRM vs. Garrison's RALops.  This was wierd.  With 52 players in a 6 game tournamet i got to play the same person twice.  <br/>
<br/>
I actually don't remember much about this game.  I have Reved his Rallitir system and Dag: Cave.  Basically i hit him on ground all game long.  Then he played the D*, so i moved the falcon there for a drain.  He tried to fight me, but lost and i played legendary starfighter.  Eventually i owned ground and won the game.  FW by like 25.<br/>
<br/>
Well i finish at 10(+90).  This was kind of a weak differential, but after that game 1 beating i think i finished well at 5-1.  So then i get to sit around and see if it is high enough to make the final confrentation.  Lafferty finished high, but i think i can still get second.  The some other Californian (don't know name) finishes at 10(+96). DAMMIT!!! 6 differential out of second! grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!  It's all good though.  I still get 3rd and an uncommon sheet.  It was alot of fun.<br/>
