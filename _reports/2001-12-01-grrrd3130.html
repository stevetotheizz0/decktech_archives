<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I had written a not so bad first toruament report but Deck Tech ate it with their stupid "can’t be logged in for more than 10 minutes becaue I don’t know how to program cookies" login system<br/>
<br/>
I went 2 and 4 in my first tournament ever, pulled a Depa Billba from my prizes<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to my friend Eugene for driving<br/>

The other one was much longer and I don’t feel like typing it again. </font></td>
