<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, <br/>
   I can honestly say that this was the most fun I have had in awhile. The Vacation Village was awesome in its support for this tournament and I have to give Samantha Wrobel a lot of credit. Coffee, soda and water were all provided at no charge to my players. The room was perfect and there was plenty of room.<br/>

YJ Report<br/>
<br/>
 28 people entered this tournament including two females who hailed from Phoenix, Arizona. I ran the tournamnet by myself. It seems the YJ Council Member had some paperwork issues to take care of and he couldn't make it. My fellow Tournamnet Directors wanted to play so I let them. It was kind of hectic, but I enjoyed the chaos. The tournament started a little late, 10:15 instead of 9:30 but I vowed to make up time. There was very good competition. I saw Gungan decks, tank decks, Amidala decks, Senators, and just about everything else. At the end of the three hour tournament one player stood out...<br/>
<br/>
1. TIM GUZMAN			10(+83)		Las Vegas<br/>
<br/>
followed by a host of others<br/>
2. Zachary Erwin		10(+82) 	San Diego <br/>
3. Pat McLemore			10(+79)		Las Vegas<br/>
4. Joey Cole			8(+95)		Las Vegas<br/>
5. Brad Bedlion			8 (+38)		Las Vegas (NV State Champ)<br/>
6. Andrew Cole			8 (+32)		Las Vegas (brother to Joey above)<br/>
7. Jennifer Ekstrom		8 (+25)		Phoenix (one of two female players)<br/>
8. Keith Melcic			8 (+22)		Las Vegas (his first YJ Tournament!)<br/>
<br/>
Note the range between the differential of Tim and Pat .. 4 points!!!<br/>
Prizes were packs of YJ Council, MODM, some Darth Maul figures (0000) and some other miscellaneous prizes. Everyone went away happy with the unique experience.<br/>
Thanks to everyone who showed up for YJ<br/>

I had 52 players from all over the Southwest and a few players from Michigan as well.  I want to thank Brad Bedlion and Robert Corbett for helping me run this tournament. They helped make it a smooth running affair. The tournament started at 1:15 p.m., 45 minutes late. Several rounds were delayed by players who had wandered off and forgot to be back quickly. The tournament ended at 9:45 p.m. Unfortunately I did not get to see all of the games that were played. Listed below is a rough breakdown of the decks that were played minus the top eight. Check out www.decktech.net for Josh Martin's in-depth report of the whole tournament. Thanks to Decipher for the uncut sheets, everybody loved them. The rest of the prize support was provided by me. Several rulings were made but nothing outside of the unusual. One hypothetical questions was asked and I did not have an answer for it.. Does a converted (to the DS) Master Luke still retain his game text???<br/>

Everybody was a good sport and I saw a lot of politeness on the part of the players.I was really impressed with the turnout and I am glad to have run this most esteemed tournament. Everybody loved the location, except Girard who lost his hotel reservation and he didn't have a confirmation number. <br/>
<br/>
Regionals is next and I plan to make it another FUN affair. See you on the circuit my fellow SM's <br/>
