<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">So currently I am riding a hot streak.  Before the tournament yesterday, I was something like 12-0.  I have been meaning to tweak my decks somewhat but I didn't find the time, seeing as I had my hair colored on Saturday (so now I am the real Slim Shady).  I missed a tournament in Tuscon on Saturday, so my boy Brian Garrison went down and represented, going undefeated and winning the whole shibang.  <br/>
<br/>
Decks<br/>
LS - Raph's Beast of a Canadian Deck<br/>
DS - Endor ops (Rumours)<br/>
<br/>
I am still playing what works.<br/>
<br/>
Game One DS vs. Don Anzalone's LS Tech deck<br/>
He was playing a light deck that start MWYHL for SAC protection and Yoda's immunity to attrition helper at the Hutt.  I get perimeter patrol set up early.  He goes luke to the docking bay, I go mara, saber, onith to the bunker with a presence of the force.  He goes Obi w/saber to bunker, weapon lev mara's stick, slice but miss. I lose both.  Next turn I go zuckass to endor.  He drops the cantina and nabrums luke there.  I drop u3po to block the drain.  He reinforces the drain at the bunker with a LS proficiency.  I go tempest one/pilot to the docking bay.  he goes falcon, cappy han, and epp leia to endor.  I lose zuckass.  Next turn I go boba fett in slave one, dengar in punishing one, dreadnought, ozzel, lateral damage.  he loses everything and I spread to kessel.  He goes r3po to the cantina.  I go vader, initiate, choke the droid (yess!!!) and he loses the droid and I lose vader to a saber swing.  u3po is still there blocking the drain.  so now I am draining for 2,1,3, and he is draining for two at the bunker (imp decree in effect).  My drains do him in and I win.<br/>
FW +15 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Game Two LS vs. Brett Kitani's Huntdown<br/>
As usual Kitani gets a god draw against me and he goes vader, cc location and presence first turn.  I take it in the ass for a few turns until I drop bousch.  He is losing four cards usually every other turn to AFA.  Visored Vision is also causing havoc.  Late game he has jabba + 4lom at the port town district and vader with a his lightsaber and tarkin at the presence enhanced drain.  he snipers bousch so I am losing five to drains, while I am draining for three at kessel w/ tantive and wedge.  Here is where he loses the game.  I drop battle order and initiate against the DSSD he just dropped to block the drain.  He loses six cards to the difference and I say go.  He forgets that he left the ship so he pays for one drain but doesn't drain again.  ( I am at 6 cards).  He loses two to uncontrollable fury and says go.  I battle again but this time he has to lose the ship or he loses the game.  he doesn't have enough to finish me off.  I win by 6.<br/>
FW +6  I felt bad afterwards, but he realized his mistake and took it in stride.<br/>
<br/>
Game Three DS vs. Michael Sinclair's the same deck as don's :-)<br/>
So this game pretty much went the same route as game one, evening including the fact that I had to take care of R3PO.  I minimized the damage done by Lightsaber enhanced drains and I set up massive drains in space.  I went from draining for 4 to draining for 9 in one turn.  This was too much and resulted in Mike being drained to death.<br/>
FW by+17<br/>
<br/>
Game Four LS vs. Brian Garrison's Set your Course deck<br/>
He was trying out David's deck just for S's and G's.  He got out some systems and locked down Kiffex w/a lateral damaged empty falcon there.  I minimize the loss by it could be worse's and made him lose lots of force to AFA's and Visored Vision (which is what really did him because of the scanning crew).  he did alter my polarized negative power coupling though, I just don't know why people hate that card. :-)<br/>
FW +10something.<br/>
<br/>
So I go undefeated again and win the tournament.  I am currently 16-0 since switching from goofy decks to competitive decks.  This weekend there are three tournaments including one of them for a set of reflections.  Regionals is in two weeks, with some secret tech in store for that SpeedCPI deck that I have hearing about. :-) </font></td>
