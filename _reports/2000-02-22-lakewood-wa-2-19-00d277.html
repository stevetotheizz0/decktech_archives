<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is going up a couple days late, sorry all.<br/>
<br/>
Prelude: Friday, WotC Corperate Office.<br/>
'Mike, what should I play?' says I.<br/>
'Whatever you want jabroni,' replies him.<br/>
'Well, you're a big help, you playing the tractor beam deck?' I ask<br/>
'Not sure, but it'd be fun to capture all those HB X-wings' says he.<br/>
'Well, I'll decide what to play tomorrow morning',I say.<br/>
'Me Too' says He.<br/>
'So, we going to Jimmy Macs tonight for good dinner' I ask<br/>
'yep' says he.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning:<br/>
I get up, have my profit deck built, and my Falke style hidden base.  I make a couple changes to the profit deck, and sit idly by awaiting mikaelians call.  At 9:00, the phone rings, 'I'll be there in 20 minutes.'  Cool, So I give some hugs and kisses to my woman, and grab a quick bite of junk food.  So I go outside, wait for Mike, and we head down to Lakewood.  So, we do our typical movie chat, and innerworkings of WotC discussion(magic decks for nemesis league)and arrive right around 10:00.<br/>
<br/>
So we arrive at Barns-n-noble, and meet our director for the morning, Ray.  Ray just moved here from D.C., and this is his first ever run tourny.  Well, simply put, things went really darn well!...  Great job dude.  We had a 13 player tuirnout, with regional notibles Walter Zylowski, Peter Sundholm, Squadern Members Ghery Petitt, and Martin Norris.  Oh, and Harvilla was there too.  So after getting a bagel, and sweet talking the cashier barista, we begin our pairings.  I'm still undecided what to play, so I figure My first matchup will decide it for me.  I'm leaning toward profit, because I know the deck better, but the HB could be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Pairings begin:<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS vs. Mike Mikaelian Darkside<br/>
well, I decide to play profit, and he desides on his Tractor beam deck, because he figures he can test it against his next opponent.  The other choice he had was, 'when weapons are outlawed'  Well, this gaem starts with no one in the audience chamber, so I decide to rescue han early, and start the damage quick. (My mind was helped to be made up by his dropping of both kiffex and kashyyk).  With his Darkdeck, he had no characters to even consider contending me with, but did get down a couple of spies under cover.  I Sorry'ed the first, but couldn't get boussh and double agent for the other one.  Well, with my quick drains, and direct loss from Or be destroyed, and his more expensivce ships in space, I am able to win by a heafty margin.  This really wasn't a fair match, we both knew what was coming, but Mike was insistant on playing it against someone else at least.  Had I played Hidden base, I most likely would have been in for a fight of my life.  most likely a better game, but we shall try it this week sometime.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 (+31)<br/>
<br/>
Game two.  well, the Lightside was domintant this round, as with a +31, I was 3rd highest (harvilla pounded some scrub for 41).  <br/>
So, I'm DS, playing against Peter sundholm's Profit deck.<br/>
I decline to give him two aliens to pound, and have a bit of a slow start.  He's getting set up well on tatooine, and I have Vader at CC.  Luke shows his face in the cantina, and I send Mara to pay a visit.  At this point I am very much curious as to initiate a duel, but am apperhensive.  I decide to not do it, and lose a 6 off the top to visage.  hmm, well he activates, and without thinking to clearly, I decide to duel LLuke.  I should have waiten for him to drop a beatdown squad, but I jumped.  well, I draw a 0, and a 4.  I lose by 1. (and there was a 6 there, darn!)  Well, after making that mistake, and having some fun with IG and company (recaptured Han), I tried tracking a 6 to get Obi, but fro some reason missed.  This game spiraled out of control for me, but it was darn fun baby.  I drak collaberationed his barrier, just to have the darn thing sensed.  poop.  Well, I lose by 30, in a game that was very enjoying.<br/>
<br/>
2 (+1)<br/>
<br/>
So, we have a quick lunch break, and I have a burger from BK.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  My DS Vs. Ghery Petitt HB fake deck (CC celebration)<br/>
Well, I get a somewhat poop draw, we are losing to visage.  He gets Dagobah, and Yodas Hut, then Bespin on the next turn.  And starts dumping sites.  Cool.  He put's Tantive, Wedge, and a bespin defense fighter at Bespin.  My Turn, I drop Zuckus and Bossk in Bus.  Battle.  I draw 2 6's, het get's BD of 0.  So I recycle, track my 2 6's for my next turn.  his turn, he drops Obi at the DTP, along with Tawass, and the landed Z-95.  I activate to my 6's, drop Vader and his sabre, and Duel Obi-Wan.  Bye bye.  So, I decide to battle Tawass, and he ends up drawing a 5, by vader.  So, I track my sixes again, and drop IG-88 to Han and chewie on my next turn.  I battle, attempt to capture Han, draw a 1 (oops, I miscounted I guess, this could be bad) and draw a 6 attrtion.  So, with that mistake, he was able to get more characters out, and I started having a fighton my hands.  Tarkin and Vader paid a vistit, just to get pathed, and R-3PO said hi to U-3PO.  I broke cover, but he said he could decline.  Well, I knew it was changed, ubt didn't want to argue it, but after checking the latest CRD, and glossary, the old ruling is dead Gherry.  So we trade drains, and I end up winning by 10.  He was worried about plaing Luke in the late game, because of dueling cards, and I did have the VO, and the Focused attack.<br/>
<br/>
4 (+11)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Profit vs. Peter sundholms COTVG deck.<br/>
well, this looked to be very interesting.  His capturing, to my avoiding.  well, Things started realy crappy for me, no locations, and Bad feeling out.  oh, that extra 2 is huge.  Well, after attempting to do some damage, and trying to double agent mara, I end up with 25 something lost before I spring Han.  whoa.  too much, way to much.  So, we're trading some drains, Do some squirmishes, avoid some battles.  (using you will take me to jabba now, in a battle, after hitting a good character, to relocate is awsome.)  At one point, I hade Masta Luke facing off against Mara and IG-88 in the AC, and he was thinking, hmm, I wonder why he moved there?  (He was planning to he hasn't come back yet me.  So he battles, I blaster deflection the Iggy shot, and swing and a miss Mara.  so I hit Iggy, and Mara dies, and Luke lives (If I remember right).  Lando gets captured in a hit and run effort, and is hauled to the Sarlacc.  Sorry old buddy, but your taking one for the gipper.  I get boush down, blocking his last good drain, and my Narrow escape, OTE is enough to finish it off.<br/>
FW by 14<br/>
<br/>
6 (+25)<br/>
<br/>
So, I go 3-1, playing some good players, and had alot of fun.  most fun in a tourny for a while.  It's always fun to mess around with the Olympia guys, and seeing mike rebound to go 3-1 too, finishing second.  the Tractor beam deck worked wonders in his second game, all I can say is, Damn!<br/>
Oh, and of course Dougie boy won, but he didn't scrub out this time.  he did play walter twice, but walters been away for a while, so he's a bit rusty.  Play something new Doug!  You want respect, that's how you get it!<br/>
<br/>
Well, this Is Charles Hickey, saying, hope you enjoyed. </font></td>
