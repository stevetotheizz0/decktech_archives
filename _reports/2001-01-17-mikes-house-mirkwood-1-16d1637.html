<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Preamble: I scrubbed out hardcore on Saturday, going 3-3 in<br/>
a 30 player tournament where, of all people, my *brother*<br/>
took 2nd. My brother’s always been a mediocre-to-good<br/>
player, but not one who’s tuned his decks for the tournament<br/>
scene. His background in Star Wars has been casual games<br/>
with me, our cousin and his roommate, playing the sort of<br/>
decks that commit 20 cards to building the Death Star or<br/>
setting up 5 card combos. But, apparently, that was a much<br/>
better way to play Saturday than playing Jedi Training and<br/>
Hunt Down (especially when you forget Jedi Test 2 for two<br/>
straight games). At any rate, I was officially "sick of<br/>
losing." At least sick of losing multiple games in a single<br/>
tournament. I had also managed to buy some Reflections II<br/>
on Saturday and traded my junk for mains. Go figure. The<br/>
coolest card was, of course, Popsicle Han, and I proceeded<br/>
to see if I could combine "fun" (always a slight concern)<br/>
with "effectivenes" in a new CCT deck. It almost worked, but<br/>
not quite to my satisfaction in a Monday playtesting with<br/>
Justin "Moffwicket" Alfs. Meanwhile, I decided uber-high<br/>
destiny were good, but waiting 7 turns to complete test 5 <br/>
and get them was bad. So I slapped together a Turn Vader<br/>
deck (TIGIH), sort of like the one on DeckTech, but with<br/>
enough significant changes to think of it as my own. For DS,<br/>
then, I had a last-minute glimpse of insight and decided<br/>
to resurrect RalOps in what I’m beginning to think is<br/>
becoming my signature style (pulling a good archetype from <br/>
the past that everyone thinks is dead and playing it).<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My AT-ST RalOps vs Moffwicket’s Profit<br/>
Right away, I ask Justin if he’s playing Ounee Ta, figuring<br/>
he must since it’s a profit deck in a heavy, heavy scum<br/>
environment. He shows it to me, but starts the card that<br/>
searches for Lando, R2 and slave Leia. Fine by me. My first<br/>
turn, I get somebody out to the DSII docking bay with<br/>
Carida and the Raltir DB. Meanwhile, the Emperor and Lord<br/>
Vader managed to find their way into my opening hand.<br/>
Sweetness beyond all sweetness. Justin’s first turn, he<br/>
deploys Ben Kenobi and frees Han to flip and retrieve a<br/>
huge 1 force. I flip on my 2nd turn with the Emperor and<br/>
Janus coming to the ground and my scrub DB transitting.<br/>
Justin starts counting his force and asks me, "So all my<br/>
rebels are deploy +2?" I nod. He saves for a couple of<br/>
turns while plinking at my life force for drain of 1, 1<br/>
profit damage (Ben found his saber). Meanwhile, I set up<br/>
Overseeing it Personally and Vader gets his saber and finds<br/>
his buddy Tarkin. Mara, also, comes to the desert to play.<br/>
Oh, and I nearly forgot, with the Emperor’s drain on the<br/>
3rd turn while he was all alone, Justin played Lost in the<br/>
Wilderness only to draw a 1 and find that Dark Jedi are not<br/>
so easily confused. Again, the Dark Jedi display their<br/>
uncanny direction finding abilities when Justin again plays<br/>
Lost in the Wilderness against Vader’s 3 character drain<br/>
and draws... yup... a 3. Ha ha. That was funny. Anyway,<br/>
after I’m done teasing Justin with my drains, he finally<br/>
saves up enough force to launch an assault at Mara,<br/>
deploying Masta Luke, R2 and 3PO and Chewie w/Blaster and<br/>
battles. I react with Tempest Scout 6, holding a Trample in<br/>
my hand and expecting Artoo’s Bad Feeling. However, Justin<br/>
plays that first to cancel my battle destiny, so I try to<br/>
trample Chewie and draw the 1 that would have trampled the<br/>
droids, but no one else. He shoots at Mara with Chewie and<br/>
misses. I slash Chewie. He tries to choke Mara and misses.<br/>
He plays Rug Hug. Hmm... No one in their right mind plays<br/>
Rug Hug, but Justin plays it. And this could be very bad.<br/>
But, true to form, Justin continues to draw weak destiny so<br/>
that Mara and Tempest Scout 6 cover the damage with a little<br/>
overflow, while Justin loses Chewie. On my turn I drain for<br/>
a bunch and return the beat-down with another AT-ST. And<br/>
then it’s a drain race until IG-88 finds out that all the<br/>
destiny in my reserve are 3 or higher, so he goes against<br/>
Han and Ben and kills Ben, only to die in the process,<br/>
leaving Han all alone. Without a drain, Justin backs up Han<br/>
and deploys Lando. Ozzel comes down in an AT-ST and Tramples<br/>
Lando. Garrett, who’s now watching the game, assists me by<br/>
making, "Squish, squish, squish" sound effects. I win by 8.<br/>
<br/>
Mike Ravelling, meanwhile, has won by the highest<br/>
differential. Garrett plays Mike, and I play Graham Neal.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: TIGIH w/uber-destiny vs. Scummy Graham (MKOS)<br/>
As long as I don’t stupidly invade the audience chamber<br/>
while my opponent has enough force left with which to beat<br/>
me down, my deck tears through Scum. Never Thinking with<br/>
his Stomach Luke allows me to put my only Jedi Luke in the<br/>
deck as a destiny 6 back up and drain and activate like a<br/>
mofo. There were too many battles in this game to recall<br/>
them all. It was battling back and forth all game, really<br/>
a good game. Graham set up his main force at Jabba’s Palace<br/>
sites, not drawing Gailid in the first few turns, thus<br/>
allowing me to set up my DB activation with Luke and Crix<br/>
and scouts until I revealed my secret anti-Scum tech: a <br/>
generic DB placed in-between the Desert Heart and Jabba’s<br/>
Palace. Aha! My scouts were now ready to invade. There was<br/>
one good battle at the &lt;&gt; DB when Graham had his Sail Barge<br/>
and a ton of aliens against my scouts. As soon as Boelo<br/>
was deployed, Chewie Protector blanked his text. An average<br/>
Fallen Portal took out both the Merc Pilot and Dengar w/<br/>
Blaster. I cancelled his destiny with General Solo and <br/>
drew a 6 for my own. He lost some characters, and on my <br/>
control phase, I blew up the Sail Barge with a tracked 6<br/>
for Under Attack. In the end, I was able to retrieve a bunch<br/>
with On the Edge while Graham was unable to find a grabber,<br/>
and Luke and my scouts took over Jabba’s Palace, forcing<br/>
Jabba to run out of the Audience Chamber so I could <br/>
cancel Scum. Full win by 17.<br/>
<br/>
Mike Ravelling won by more than anybody else for the<br/>
second straight round, effectively annihilating Garrett<br/>
Larson in one battle at the Cantina.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS vs Garrett’s TIGIH<br/>
I leave Luke alone until I get Vader into my hand. But the<br/>
deciding event of the game... I draw Overseeing it <br/>
Personally into my opening hand. Garrett has started Battle<br/>
Plan, Wise Advice and Squadron Assignments, so I’m a bit<br/>
confused, but Garrett’s always doing things a bit off-kilter<br/>
so it’s no great shakes. I get another quick flip, using<br/>
Imperial Command to fetch Ozzel into my hand for big<br/>
activation on my 3rd turn with lots of DB’s controlled.<br/>
And, combining the deciding event with the deciding moment,<br/>
Garrett searches for Wedge by revealing Red Squad 1 on his<br/>
2nd or 3rd turn and fails to find him, thus allowing me to<br/>
verify his masses of Eloms and inserts. Ah... one of *those*<br/>
decks. And suddenly all the guilt about playing RalOps has<br/>
completely dissipated and vanished. And the Overseeing it<br/>
Personally in my hand is a godsend, and the You Cannot Hide<br/>
that I started with is going to stay there ALL GAME.<br/>
Garrett is unable to do much to me while I flip, but he<br/>
moves Wedge over to Raltir when Mirax can join him in her<br/>
ship. I have Bossk in Bus, Fel, a Laser Cannon and Lateral<br/>
Damage in my hand. Naturally, I use 2 to search for Saber 1<br/>
and beat the tar out of a 0-power lone Wedge in ship, by<br/>
30-something. Wedge forfeits for 6, and then it’s a mass of<br/>
Eloms and inserts hitting the lost pile while Fel dominates<br/>
Raltir. A few quick drains, a barrier and trample on an<br/>
Elom brigade, and the game is mine. FW by 20-something.<br/>
<br/>
Mike Ravelling might not have won by as much as me that<br/>
round, but he still 30+ differential ahead of me. We just<br/>
played the same sides, so I hope someone good gets paired<br/>
against him. Graham Neal gets paired to play his dark<br/>
against Mike’s light. I think there is hope.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My TIGIH vs Travis Bean’s Bring Him Before Me<br/>
I take out Staging Areas in favor of Wise Advice, and this<br/>
proves to be a very, very good move when I verify Travis’s<br/>
deck a few turns in and see the heavy SAC I feared. As it<br/>
turns out, a turn or two after I give up Luke to Vader and<br/>
force Vader back to the Throne Room, I draw Insight and<br/>
scrap it for Staging Areas, so everything works out. Except<br/>
that Travis is activating a bunch, too, and has managed to<br/>
get down a large force at Endor, including Veers in a walker<br/>
and IG-88 with gun. That does not bode well for me. So, I<br/>
save my force (since we’re both losing one a turn, me to his<br/>
drain, and him to his objective) and deploy en masse to the<br/>
Tatooine DB he gave me. Travis tried one early duel, drawing<br/>
a 5 and a 4 (I think) only to stack a card, so he’s pretty<br/>
much given up on dueling at this point. He chases me around<br/>
for a bit, until I lash back with Obi w/Saber and Nien Numb<br/>
and Lando vs Mara 4-Lom and some others. I lose the battle,<br/>
but my attrition clears his site. However, I have to stack<br/>
one, and we’re even on the stacking. I draw the back door<br/>
and have this brilliant idea to play a couple of characters<br/>
there and split forces to try to get in a drain. That allows<br/>
Travis to battle me there with IG-88 and Fett, miss the<br/>
capture (and prevent me from On the Edging Crix out of the<br/>
battle), draw his destiny and stack another card while Crix<br/>
and Blount cover my damage. I get Wedge up in space with<br/>
a Laser on R2 in R5, and he gets in some drains, evening<br/>
things out a bit. Travis then starts draining at the Back<br/>
Door, so I move over to block the drain at the Back Door<br/>
with Han, Cracken, Leia w/Blaster and landing Wedge. He<br/>
doesn’t initiate the battle due to Fallen Portal but<br/>
reinforces his troops, sending IG-88 over. I initiate a<br/>
battle and use my first action to play I Know. He captures<br/>
Han. I shoot somebody. I play the card to reduce his<br/>
destiny by 3. Attrition clears the site on both sides, but<br/>
he stacks another one, giving him three. I battle with Obi<br/>
w/Saber against the lone Ephont Mon he moved to my Hoth DB,<br/>
and I stack my 2nd. On his turn he duels me, but he wins,<br/>
so I just lose 3. My turn, I don’t do much, drain for 1.<br/>
On his turn again, he duels and loses. I stack one. I say,<br/>
"If you draw a 6, you win. If you don’t I win." I have<br/>
tracked 6’s all through my deck. He draws a 6. He wins by 5<br/>
while I have about 20 life force left. Good game.<br/>
<br/>
Mike Ravelling beats Graham’s scum deck like a stubborn<br/>
mule. Graham’s scum suddenly looks vulnerable. Mike<br/>
suddenly looks invincible again.<br/>
<br/>
The final results then, go:<br/>
Mike Ravelling 8 (big differential)<br/>
Josh Grace (me) 6 (40-something)<br/>
Travis Bean 6 (less than 40-something)<br/>
Other people<br/>
<br/>
This just in! Mike Ravelling is Prince Xixor. Ability of 6<br/>
needed just to draw a destiny against him, and he’s <br/>
immune to attrition less than 5 while Jim Li is not at the<br/>
same tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers:<br/>
Justin for playing Profit and getting beaten.<br/>
Graham for playing Scum and getting beaten.<br/>
Prince Xixor for winning the tournament with a cool LS deck.<br/>
Travis for turning my Luke. "1 out of 2 Lukes agree..."<br/>
Myself for avoiding pairing with Herb.<br/>
The Hansicle for looking cool.<br/>
Mirax for being hotter than any of the other SW:CCG females,<br/>
not much for personal interest other than debate value.<br/>
<br/>
Jeers:<br/>
Garrett for playing Eloms &amp; Inserts. Boo! Hiss!<br/>
Justin’s Hansicle deck. (You know what I mean.)<br/>
Shannon Baksa for still looking like a junky even if she is<br/>
wearing a sheer top in the new photo.<br/>
Herb. In general; I’ve tried to avoid saying this, but each<br/>
Tuesday, this statement has just become all the more<br/>
inevitable.<br/>
All those people who buy 3 or 4 boxes of an expansion and<br/>
then try to "trade" with you, laughing at your cards and<br/>
kicking sand in your face while taking off with your gal.<br/>
Graham’s sex jokes. They’re as stale as his old...<br/>
That Josh Grace guy for putting Traffic Control and Reactor<br/>
Terminal in his Top 10 cards. What a dweeb!<br/>
<br/>
Ciao!<br/>
