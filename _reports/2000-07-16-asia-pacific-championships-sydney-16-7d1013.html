<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">G'day,<br/>
I thought that given that I've got far too much time on my hands, writing a<br/>
tournament report seemed like a good idea.<br/>
We (Luca and I) left Melbourne Friday evening on the train, slept<br/>
sporadically, and arrived in Sydney at about 6:30am Saturday morning.<br/>
Having won the state championships a month or two beforehand, I had already<br/>
qualified for day two, while Luca needed to play.<br/>
While the 'unqualified' players were qualifying, Kev ran a DS2 sealed deck<br/>
tournament which was alright.  Playing DS2 sealed deck was incredibly<br/>
boring - Each player has plenty of characters and starships, and it's just a<br/>
battle of attrition.  Fortunately, I was given light, and between 2xA Few<br/>
Maneuvers and General Solo, Dark Side stuff died awfully quickly, while my<br/>
dudes lived.  And Hobbie in his personal X-Wing is huge...  About half-way<br/>
through the tournament, after I'd finished my game, I looked over to see<br/>
Stuart Jones finishing up his game, so I wandered over to see how he went,<br/>
and this arrogant prick (otherwise known as Stuart Lauder) yells at me for<br/>
deck scouting.  I say uh, "ok," turn around, and go over the other side of<br/>
the room.  After this, the insignificant lowlife goes and complains to<br/>
Kevin, the SM.  Not only does he have the audacity to lie, and be deceitful,<br/>
but he is somehow convinced that I have some sort of inclination to see what<br/>
he is playing.  It never ceases to amaze me how self-important some people<br/>
are.  Why the hell would I care what he was playing in a tournament I wasn't<br/>
even playing in?  Unfortunately, he beat Jones, and managed to qualify for<br/>
day 2 in 16th position.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, that night we went off to find out where we were staying, had a<br/>
30 minute walk there, and Stuart Jones and I worked together on a light<br/>
deck.  We ended up with a version of EBO, and already had our dark decks<br/>
sorted.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, Dark vs Rob Blanford (1763)<br/>
Rob's a good player, even if i do harass him about being a little slow :)<br/>
We played at the Canberra Grand Slam earlier this year, and from memory he<br/>
beat me during that game.  Anyway, he was playing EBO, I started with<br/>
Decree, got some stuff down and happening on the Hoth planet setting up<br/>
Decree, and sent Bosssk (barriered), Zuckuss, 4-LOM and IG-88 and Ozzel to<br/>
fight somewhere, and killing stuff, but on the following turn Zuckusss got<br/>
Laser Cannoned and Bossk was beaten down for +5 force or so.  Fortunately,<br/>
with decree set up and my retrieval happeninng with ISB, I was able to take<br/>
the win by about 10 force.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, Light vs Stuart Jones (1898)<br/>
This is not a game I want to be playing.  All I can say is that I got a<br/>
miraculous draw, and Stuart got a poor one, and after force choking the<br/>
force choker, I was able to get a couple of drains of 9 in, and EPP Obi +<br/>
EPP Luke combined to hurt some more, but not until after EBO was cancelled.<br/>
The drains of 1 did him in still, and I was able to win by 20.  95 times out<br/>
of a hundred, the dark deck should win this matchup, I think, but some<br/>
fortunate cards went off the top of the reserve deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3, Dark vs Luca Costanzo (1770)<br/>
Great, I've travelled 800km to play guys I can play any day of the week.<br/>
Unreal.  Luca's also playing EBO, Decree is started again, and is in<br/>
trouble.  Fortunately for me, Luca also deployed Yavin4 system, and the<br/>
Yavin4 dockingbay reduces his drain there.  It seems to me that the way to<br/>
beat EBO is to outdrain it, and to set Decree up.  But either way, I was<br/>
able to win by 29 or something, 'cause he could drain for very little, and<br/>
although EPP Luke/EPP Han/EPP Leia made an appearance to turn decree off, it<br/>
wasn't until EBO was gone, and an endless supply of forfeit 6 dudes who<br/>
don't get hit by weapons is a hard thing to outfight, especially when you<br/>
have an opponent who's tracking destiny.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4, Light vs Jared Brown (1785)<br/>
Never having played Jared before (except that I might've played against him<br/>
in the sealed deck the previous day), I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was<br/>
able to set up EBO pretty quicikly, but Zuckusss, Boba and Bossk made an<br/>
appearance against a couple of my X-Wings.  Fortunately for me, he declined<br/>
to attack me, so on my turn I deployed an extra x-wing or two, 2 X-Wing<br/>
Laser Cannons, battled, made Boba and Zuckuss lost, power pivoted Bossk, and<br/>
made him lose +18 force.  After that, Jared didn't have much chance, and it<br/>
was just a matter for me to force drain and spread out.  EBO rocks vs Court<br/>
'cause Arconas don't get hammered by Nemet/Arnet, although S+V is kinda<br/>
nasty.  Full win by high twenties.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5, Dark vs Stuart Lauder (1833)<br/>
He was playing Bothawui Operatives, with a copy of Artoo in Red 5 or two,<br/>
some Luke Skywalkers, Red Leader in Red 1, Gold Leader in Gold 1, and<br/>
nothing else for space.  Naturally, I started Battle Plan, and he barely<br/>
drained all game.  Soon, I had Decree in effect, and after altering<br/>
Maneuvering Flaps a bunch of times, I was safe to go down to the farm even<br/>
though I had no walker.  No EPPs allowed my guys to be outside anyway, and<br/>
with the -1 from ISB and the Decree, he could only drain where he had<br/>
Ithorians.  Naturally, Tempest 1 + Igar + someone went to go kill one, and<br/>
IG-88/4-LOM dealt with the other.  After that point, aware that he was<br/>
unable to win the game, knowing he was beaten, Stuart knowingly decided to<br/>
stall the game out to prevent me from getting the 2 points.  How does<br/>
someone justify themselves when they behave like this?  Now, technically,<br/>
Stuart played within the rules.  He moved his speeders over to the Farm so<br/>
as to force me to battle (which takes longer than draining), killing one of<br/>
my ISB dudes who would simply get retrieved + replaced, and had to do it<br/>
merely long enough to stall the game out.  In hindsight, it didn't matter as<br/>
I was able to go on and remain undefeated and thus get into the final, but<br/>
Stuart's decision to stall the game out was typical of his mentality.  It<br/>
makes no difference to him whether I get 1 point or two - it's just such a<br/>
small-minded and spiteful thing to do.  It's also unfortunate that there are<br/>
such scum playing this game.  Though he may well have been to worlds, both<br/>
him and I are fully aware that he will never amount to anything significant<br/>
or worthwhile.  Timed win by 16.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6, Light vs Luca Costanzo (1770)<br/>
Luca was also playing Court, but my drains in space were just too big.  He<br/>
might've come to try and fight in space, but X-Wing Laser Cannons tends to<br/>
eliminate Bounty Hunter ships very quickly.  Full win by 27 or so.  As it<br/>
turns out, Luca's only two losses for the day were to me, which was rather<br/>
unfortunate.  As he remarked on the train on the way home, he lost 2 games<br/>
and ended up in 6th, while Ben Isaacs lost two games and ended up with a<br/>
trip to worlds.  Of course, I'm rather biased here, since I have now<br/>
developed a distinct distaste for finals, but they are rather silly :).  On<br/>
that subject, wouldn't it be a better idea to simply play an extra round<br/>
rather than have a final?  The top 2 players play each other at the 7th<br/>
game, and if the top player wins that, he'll probably still be in first<br/>
place.  On the other hand, if the lower player wins it, then effectively the<br/>
8th and final game becomes the decider anyway.  It might be something to<br/>
look at in the future :)<br/>
<br/>
The scores before the final:<br/>
<br/>
Me: 11 + 130-odd<br/>
Ben Isaaccs 10+a lot<br/>
Stuart Jones 8+<br/>
Marcus Cheong 8+<br/>
Wai Bien Wong 8+<br/>
Luca Costanzo 8+<br/>
....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, Dark vs Ben Issaacs (1656)<br/>
He's playing some sabacc deck, so I twilek for TBHTP early, grab his first<br/>
sabacc, monnok him once netting a couple of cards, and really just do as<br/>
little as possible to win.  I made a couple of mistakes here, and probably<br/>
could've pushed the differential as high as 28 or 29, but it wasn't to be.<br/>
He also did well to force me to deploy as much as possible, but i ended up<br/>
winning by 26.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, Light vs Ben again<br/>
I got a dodgy draw, played badly, he played well, and beat me by more force.<br/>
I made mistakes here and there, and probbaly could've been 5 or so force<br/>
better off, but I was simply out-played and beaten by 31.  It was just so<br/>
frustrating to see my 4th final end in a loss again, especially after doing<br/>
so well the previous 7 games.  It was so frustrating to think that his Dark<br/>
Deck, with Sabacc, was probably the only deck there that day that could beat<br/>
my light deck by more than 26 force.  It was so frustrating to see him<br/>
effectively net 5 force every time he played sabacc (retrieved 3 with Lando,<br/>
and stole one of my ships), making him 4 force better off and me 1 worse<br/>
off.  It was so frustrating to see him deploy Search And Destroy and First<br/>
Strike (which was bad to my Arconas), and to establish steady drains for 2 +<br/>
2.  It was frustrating to see that rogue deck, unique to the tournament and<br/>
difficult to meta against, beat me.  It was so frustrating to see months of<br/>
preparation and effor go down the drain.  It was so frustrating to end up in<br/>
second again.<br/>
Anyway, I've no doubt that Ben will do a fantastic job in Florida come<br/>
October, and I wish him all the best.  It would be cool if a Sabacc deck<br/>
wins worlds.<br/>
<br/>
For myself, I think I've got one more tournament.  It's sorta sad to say<br/>
this, but I think that come July 30, I'll have to significantly reduce how<br/>
much I play and pay for this game.  Realistically, though this game is still<br/>
fun most of the time, my priorities have changed over the 4½ years I have<br/>
been playing this game, and it is simply too expensive to continue buying<br/>
new sets.  I can no longer justify myself paying $5 or $6 for a pack of<br/>
cards, the vast majority of which I will never use.  Josh Martin's got it<br/>
down sweet.<br/>
<br/>
And besides, playing NetSet is much more fun, doesn't require weeks of<br/>
preparation, and is quick and easy, but still requires a similar depth of<br/>
thought.<br/>
