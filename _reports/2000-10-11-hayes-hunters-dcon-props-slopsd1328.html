Hayes Hunters Props/Slops from DecipherCon<br/>
<br/>
I had originally intended to write a full-fledged TR, but I was like 2 pages into it and not even through the first game of day 1 plus Im lazy.  Instead, I tried to give you all what you really want- your name in someone elses TR.  I know I forgot a lot of names (insert drinky-drinky motion here) but I did try to put everyone who meant something to me in there.  So please know that if your name wasnt on this list (and you didnt fall into one of the slops categories) I didnt mean to offend you!  Conversely, if we hung out to ANY extent, drinking, or me watching you eat, etc. please dont feel like I shortchanged you here- I know who YOU are.  Id have liked to write more things about each of you, since you all are some of the coolest friends a guy could want, but then youd think I was gay or something well, whatever.  I had a blast, and I owe it all to you.<br/>
