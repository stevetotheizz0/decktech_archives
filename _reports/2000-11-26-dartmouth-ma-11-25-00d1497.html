<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well it all started 3 weeks ago when I saw the pink flyer in the mail from GrandMaster Games and Hobbies.  SWCCG Constructed Tournament FREE 11/25/00.  Cool.  Another Dartmouth tournament, these are always fun.  I’ve always done well in Dartmouth, 3 and 1, and 4 and 2 my two times there so I immediately set aside the day for the trip up.  <br/>
<br/>
I went down to Rockland to playtest with my friends Brian Partridge and Dan Mailloux a week earlier.  We all agreed LS sucked and DS ruled.  I had a Fakeout Ebo deck with baragwins, mains, and on the edges for light, and a similar deck to Matt Sokol’s The Beast for dark.  I played Brian Partridge, who is a great player.  He was playing a Hidden Base Fakeout deck with mains and mad activation for light.  I played stupid and lost to it, but I really liked it and thought I might try a version of it out.<br/>
<br/>
So the night before the tournament I have two of my friends over, Jon Bragg and Matt McGann, who are both rather new to the game.  I playtested with them, and we helped each other with decks.  We fine tuned my light deck and my dark deck just plain old ruled so I left it alone.  After Matt left, I decided Jon needed a better light deck so I gave him some xwings and some high destiny droids and built him a numbers deck.  I should have played that deck too cuz it ruled.  Well we went on our merry ways and said we’d see each other the next day.<br/>
<br/>
It was about this time when I got a call from Rich Hinds.  For the second week in a row his ride skipped out and he might not be able to go.  Great.  He finally set up a ride and everything was fine.<br/>
<br/>
So I got a good nights sleep so I could be mentally alert the next day so I could play to the best of my ability.  I got up the next morning and gave my friend Dan Mailloux a call so we could put finishing touches on my decks.  We put some drain sites in my light, talked about stuff for a while and I was off.<br/>
<br/>
Well my ride came and I rode up with Rich Hinds, Matt McGann, Tim McDonough, and Jon Bragg.  Basically all we did in the card was try to find room for a card in Rich’s deck.  We showed up in Dartmouth and hour early and to my surprise my friend Brian Partridge walks in!  Sweet someone who isn’t a scrub!  Well I made some trades, bought the new scrye, looked at some cards from Reflections 2, which are sweet.  Well Mike Jenkins and his friend Andy show up, the local kids from Dartmouth show up and we’re underway.  Hope I don’t get paired against Partridge.<br/>

Game 1:<br/>
My version of BHBM The Beast vs. Brian Partridges (1715) Fakeout EBO with Baragwins<br/>
<br/>
So it turns out when we playtested the week before I went with what Brian was playing and Brian went with what I was playing.  That’s pretty funny. I drew my hand got a bunch of red and the hoth war room.  Crap. Well the game started out slow the first few turns basically card drawing.  My first turn I pulled Carida, Palpy, Force Lightning  and Endor Docking Bay because the Death Star 2 one wasn’t in there.  I drew a few and said go.  He put an ithorian down, drew and said go.  I still didn’t have a vader in hand so I got my ds2 docking bay put down janus and moved them both over to the docking bay to get more activation.  I drew and got a lord vader and saber and said go.  He just drew, he seemed to be having trouble getting his baragwins.  He said go.  I put down lord vader and his stick to the endor docking bay.  I pulled cc docking bay and drew a few getting mara and a much anger in him and a responsibility of command and said go.  He pulled Jedi Luke from deck and put him to the 4th marker, drew a few said go.  I put down mara and a presence of the force on the cc docking bay after draining for 2 at the endor docking bay.   I transited Vader over to the cc docking bay with mara and said go.  He didn’t drain me at the 4th marker, and in fact didn’t for the whole game cuz he was fearing that I was using Always Thinking With Your Stomach.  Fine by me.  He put down Boushh to stop my drain at the cc docking bay and said go.  Well I drained for zip and deployed secret plans slowing down his retrieval of 7’s which he hadn’t even set up yet.  I then transited Vader over to the Endor Docking Bay and he left boussh there.  I was surprised and moved Mara over and he still left her there.  I knew something was up.  (I know that wasn’t the best move to make, I just wanted to see what might happen, plus if he followed my drain with Boushh and put someone down at the cc docking bay to drain I could shaft them next turn, granted it would only be a one time force loss for 4 but it would still have an impact.   I said go.  He activated and broke boushh’s cover and put ani’s saber on her, put down a baragwin and put down chewie at a echo site.  He said go.  I drained him for 3 at the endor docking bay and set up the shaft (responsibility of command/much anger in him combo) on Boussh and put down Sarkli at the site and said go.  He activated, lost 4 to shaft, put down do or do not which would hurt me the whole game and transited boussh to the hoth docking bay.  You may say I wasted my shaft, but I gave him 4 force loss and stopped a drain of 3, which who knows how long he could have maintained it.   Then I made a big scrub mistake, he played on the edge on chewie and named a 6, he had 4 force in his pile, and me forgetting about secret plans, sensed it.  I lost 2 force and the sense when I didn’t have to.  He played another one and I sensed it again.  Ok I’m an idiot.  He ended his turn and said go.  I activated and drained for 2 at the site where I have sarkli.  He played counter assault and I had no more senses left.  Well there’s a 7 he tracked, I gotta lose 5.  Great mike, great.  I drained for 3 at the endor docking bay with mara and vader.  Brian thought he had tracked two more 7’s but actually there was a one and a 4 and he played counterassault and it hurt him bad.  I then transited vader and mara over to the cc docking bay, drew a few and said go.  He activated and retrieved 2 7’s with two baragwins costing him 4 force.  He played on the edge I didn’t have a sense so I let it go through.  He said 6 thinking he tracked a 7 but instead drew a 1.  Me and Brian being stupid we’re thinking of the text of Off The Edge and thought he instead had to lose 5 force, but in all effects he was only supposed to lose Chewie.  Whoops.   Well I drained him for more than he was draining me for the rest of the game, and he pulled of On The Edge once and I again forgot about Secret Plans.  I’m an idiot.  I outdrain him the whole game and pull of a win by 5, even though I shouldn’t have.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win 2 (+5)<br/>
Total 2 (+5)<br/>
Highs: Pulling off a win against Brian Partridge.<br/>
Lows: Do or do not and forgetting about secret plans.<br/>
<br/>
Well I’m off to a decent start pulling off a win but playing like an idiot.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
My HB fakeout mains vs. Rich Hinds (1547) stolen Invincible Court Deck that he won’t admit taking<br/>
<br/>
Well it’s one thing to get ideas from a deck and say you are playing a similar version.  It’s quite another copying it card for card and then putting in other cards for cards you don’t have and then saying you modified it or calling it your own.  That’s what Rich did, but you don’t have to take my word for it.  Well this game started out with me deploying my starting stuff and my effects, strike planning, insurrection and mobilization points.  I got the endor sytem in my opening hand along with a docking bay, gold leader in gold 1, gift of the mentor, obi wan’s lightsaber an epp han, and 2 red cards.  He started the Invincible Court start which included an incredibly powerful card called no bargain.  That card changed the game.  He put down mighty jabba and evazan in his turn and said go.  I pulled general crix madine from reserve deck and activated.  I pulled the cloud city docking bay, the dagobah sytem, yoda’s hut and cracken from reserve deck and put cracken and crix down at the hoth docking bay which was in my hand.  I also deployed the endor system setting myself up for mad activation.  I played a lost grimtaash and got nothing.  I took one damage from the court objective and said go.  He drained me for one and put fett with gun down at the site with mighty jabba and evazan.  He then deployed iggy with gun at another site, drew a few and said go.  I activated, put down gold leader in gold 1 at endor to drain, played a grimtaash used this time, lost one to court damage drew a bunch of good stuff in 2x epp luke, obi wan kenobi and lando with ax and said go.  He activated drained for one, put down djas puhr, chall bekan and pulled a cc technician to put with them.  He said go.  Ok here was my dillema, I couldn’t deploy han, luke, obi and lando and battle in the same turn and get all my weapon targets and destinies because of no bargain, so I put down obi with saber and luke epp, put down draw their fire, and battled.  I played gift of the mentor during my weapons phase as the first action.  I then swung at fett with luke’s saber, missed with a draw of a 4 and a 0.  He shot luke with a 5 and assassinated him.  Here’s where I was an idiot.  I already had played Gift Of The Mentor so I was set to get 3 destiny draws because I already played it, but the td was watching and both him and rich agreed it had no effect and went to my hand, me being stupid agreed.  I swung with obi’s stick at evazan and drew a 1 and a 1 and missed him too.  Great.  My battle destiny, (even though I should have had 3) was a 0.  He lost nothing, I lost luke and obi.  WTF.  I said go.  Now I know I should have battled him at the other site, but I was on a roll of stupid mistakes that day.  He drained for 2 and drew some and said go.  I activated drained for one at endor and again decided to go after fett w/ gun and evazan.  I put down a luke epp and han epp there.  He played disarmed and killed luke.  I’m an idiot I realize now that was my deploy phase and he knew it and I couldn’t do anything about it.  So I was stuck with han.  I said go.  He activated, dumped a whole ton of aliens to beat down han and I lost han and 12.  Great.  He said go.  I drained for one at endor, deployed lando with ax to the empty tatooine site and transited madine and cracken to the cc docking bay to get drains in to make the loss respectable.  I took one damage from court, drew 2 and said go.  He drained for 2 and deployed zuckuss against gold leader, retrieved 3 I lost one and the battle.  He said go.  I drained for 2 for a few turns and he eventually outdrained me and won. <br/>
<br/>
FL 0(-28)<br/>
Total:<br/>
2(-23)<br/>
<br/>
I’m off to a great day so far.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
My  Light vs. Sam Wolf’s SYCFA CPI deck (1491)<br/>
<br/>
Well this was a very one sided game.  I started my normal stuff and he did too.  He pulled a death star gunner and put him at the ds docking bay, drew a few and said go.  I pulled all my stuff I normally do and put epp luke down to smack the ds gunner around.  I said go.  He activated, put out another site and drew.  He said go.  I went activated, set up larger activation, set up a drain of two at 2 cc sites with epp leia, crix and cracken.  I moved  luke over to the ds war room to get a bigger drain going, I said go.  He activated some and dropped a star destroyer and a few sytems and said go.  I drained him for 6 and drew a few and said go.  He activated, drained for one, put out more systems and a few more starships.  He said go.  I activated drained for 6 again and put out gold leader in gold 1 to battle a star destroyer he left alone.  I drew a 5 and won the battle made him lose the sd.  I said go.  He activated drained for one again and said go.  I activated drained for 6 and put lt. blount on gold leader in gold 1 and moved it over to kiffex and said go.  He activated drained for one and put down 2 star destroyers against blount and gold leader in gold 1.  He drew a 2 I drew a 5, he lost one of the sd’s and I lost blount.  He left the sd there and said go.  I activated drained for 6, battled his sd away and said go.  He activated deployed some more systems, (don’t know why) and said go.  I drained him out.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win 2 (+35)<br/>
Total: 4 (+12)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My Dark vs. D.J. Burgess’s EBO (1365)<br/>
Well this was another one sided game.  I set up my mad emperor activation turn 1 and said go.  He put down some hoth sites, drew and said go.  I put down lord vader and his saber to the endor docking bay and said go.  He put down epp luke at the 3rd marker after I told him he could deploy him from reserve deck and said go.  I drained for 2 and set up mara and her saber at the cc docking bay.  I drew a few and said go.  He activated and put down more ebo sites, and a system.  He said go.  I activated drained, drew a few said go.  He activated, forgot to drain threw down a 2 awings and tantive 4 to sullust and said go.  I activated drained, put down zuckuss beat them all up and drew a 6, stacked a card on ins. rebellion.  Game went like this the whole game.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win 2 (+29)<br/>
Final: 6 (+41)<br/>
<br/>
So Rich won the tournament with his stolen decks.  I came in 4th but had a great time, learned a lot from my mistakes, and most likely moved my rating up (either to 1510 or 1502 depending on what name they update)<br/>
