Friday night Ted Panczyszyn swings by Binghamton and picks me up, by 9:00 we are on the road down to Ithaca.  10:00 finds us entering tier 4 of Ithaca College where we will be spending the night.  Ted and I are greeted with the famous Team Albany “Whazzzzzupppppp” from Brian Terwilliger.  After high fives and light chitchat we get down to making decks, since we have to get an early start for Syracuse the next morning.  Since I collect with the Sokol brothers and all the cards are with Danny, I won’t be getting my decks till the next morning.  So I sit down a proxy my light while Brian and Ted play a game.  Afterward they finish I playtest my Light against Ted, then against Brain.  Upon beating Brain, he decides his dark needs a sarlac, so he digs one out, makes his revisions and we go to bed.   At 6:30 in the morning I get a call from Matt Sokol telling me we don’t have enough cards to play the decks we all wanted to play, so I agree to play ROPS (hey it’s 6:30 in the morning I would have agreed to anything) and I roll over and fall back asleep.<br/>
Bright and early the next morning Brain, Ted and I rise, shower and head to ‘cuse for the 8 game tourney.  We get there and Ted (who is running the tounry) begins to set up so Brain and I fill out our command cards and await the arrival of the rest of team Albany.  Soon Marty Terwilliger comes through the door with the first carload of people.  We all exchange hello’s and in a few minutes Brad Kipple and Aaron Kingery come in with the rest of the team.  I get my decks from Matt and glance them over to make sure everything is there and we laugh about how Brad and Aaron got speeding tickets on the way down.  The last few people turn in their command cards and the tourney gets underway<br/>
<br/>
DECKS:<br/>
LS: MWYHL training Daughter to test 2 and Palace Raiders in speeders at docking bays for activation and drain<br/>
<br/>
DS: ROPS, old school.<br/>
<br/>
Game One: <br/>
LS V.S. Nathan Brown’s My Kind Of Scum<br/>
Nathan reveals Myo as his rep so I know the Abyssans are sure to follow.  He activates and Drops Mighty Jabba in the Audience chamber, he also drops the Lower Passage from his hand and draws his remaining force.  I pull Yoda’s Hutt, Daughter and Tatooine Docking Bay and draw the last force.  Nathan drains for one and drops Myo with the text of the Chamber, then he drops some abyssians down and it’s my turn.   I search again and pull the training area, Test one, Yoda and the Endor Docking Bay.  I draw up a few more.  Nathen drains me for a couple more and a few more random aliens hit the table.  I draw for my test and Leia becomes a great warrior, I grab the Bog Clearing, test 2, the Cloud City docking bay and, after moving Leia over, draw a couple more.  I get drained for 2 more and Nathan puts a couple more Abyssians on a skiff at the desert heart, he also drops Scum.  I activate and Leia completes test 2.  Now I drop down EPP Obi on a racing skiff with a palace raider.  A second Palace raider hits the Docking bay in a Subsurvo accompanied by a Baragwin.  Obi battles and Nathan plays Wounded wookie on obi.  I draw 2 destinies and Nathan gets none so that clears the site.  From there it was all downhill for Nathan.  He drains for two and I lose a racing skiff and landing claw from my hand, then retrieve the landing claw with the Baragwin.  Nathan saves so I retrieve the racing skiff with the Baragwin on my turn and start draining.  I get the Bacta Tank out and drop Epp Luke at the lower passage and battle.  Again he has no destiny so I chop one and kill two more with my destiny draw.  Nathan struggled to keep up from this point but I just kept retrieving his drains with my Baragwins.  He dropped down to battle my raider at the docking bay but I reacted with the second raider and Obi.  A well-placed Fallen Portal ensured that he would regret battling.  From there we battled a bit more and eventually Luke took over the Lower Passage and Obi held the docking bay.  In the end my retrieval was too much for him.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 18<br/>
Highs: The deck worked exactly the way I hoped, the retrieval factor was too much for my opponent and fallen portals kept him from drawing destiny while I drew 2 in almost every battle<br/>
Lows: Nothing, the deck worked like a charm<br/>
<br/>
Game Two:<br/>
DS V.S. Aaron Kingery’s MWYHL/Sabacc<br/>
My first Albany match up of the tourney. I hate traveling to ‘cuse just to play people I can play in the comfort of our own store, well what can you do.  Aaron starts MWYHL and I start ROPS. I am thinking quick flip so I am happy to see 2 sites in my opening hand along with Ephant Mon.  I pull a second site from my deck and the executer docking bay, I drop Ephant Mon at the Executer to boost my activation.  Aaron pulls the Hut and deploys Daughter from his reserve.  I deploy a third sight and drop a couple of 2-2 scrubs and Ardren to flip my third docking bay comes out thanks to IAO and I’m done.  Aaron activates and gets the training area, Yoda and test one, he also deploys the Casino from his hand and drops Artoo at the Casino.  I drain for three and pull S&amp;D and deploy it.  I draw some and let Aaron take his turn.  Leia passes test one and Aaron gets another site for Dagobah and drops test 2.  Then he drops Rendezvous point and gold leader in gold one then he says go, I activate and he realizes he never moved Leia.  We both laugh about it and I get Kashyyyk from my reserve deck, drain for three (paying for Aarons great warrior) and Deploy Boba in and Vaders Shuttle and draw.  I end my turn and Aaron starts stacking destinies with How did we get into this mess.  He draws his whole remaining reserve deck and gives Artoo a retractable arm.  He then recirculates  and tells me to go.  After I activate one he plays Cloud City sabacc. I stop right there, how can he play sabacc, well Artoo’s little arm makes him a thief and all you need for sabacc is a thief on cloud city.  I laugh expecting nothing less creative from Aaron (those of you who have played him know what I mean) and hook the Sabacc.  Well Aaron draws the perfect Sabacc he has stacked and I draw Zuckuss in and something else.  So Aaron takes Zuckuss and I lose the other card.  I drain for one and Aaron plays we’re doomed so I only get one drain off and S&amp;D won’t even damage him this turn.  Next we both laugh b/c once again Leia has forgotten to pursue her jedi testing.  I search and pull Bossk in and drop Tempest one on Bossk with a pilot, and DLOTS gets deployed to the Shuttle.  I let Aaron go and he starts stacking destinies again, he fools around with some other minor effects and uses hiding in the garbage to get another sabacc.  Then he draws up do get his we’re doomed back into his hand.  I can hardly keep from laughing b/c he has once again forgotten to move Leia.  My turn I drain, search and deploy another pilot to Bossk.  His turn we play Sabacc again.  I lose two force from his perfect sabacc and he activates.  He then draws to grab zuckess to shut me down in the air, It’s just getting funny now b/c again he has forgotten to move Leia!!  So while he is kicking himself I search grab tarkin and drain, we’re doomed cuts it to one again and deploy to the shuttle.  Then I let Aaron go.  Aaron stacks more destinies and gets ready to play Sabacc again, he uses Hiding in the garbage to get a sabacc and tells me to go.  Now it’s just sad b/c Leia is still not with test 2, he has forgotten to move again.  I deploy one more pilot to Bossk and after the drain is cut to one again by we’re doomed, I move over to Dagobah, I also move Boba to Ralitier in fear of my own Zuckuss.  Aaron plays Sabacc and I lose 2 more.  Then, finaly, he move’s Leia over to test 2.  So after five turns of forgetting Leia might actually test to 2.  On my turn my drais are reduced by we’re doomed so I land my two ships.  Vader and Tarkin line up across from Yoda while Tempest one and 3 2-2 guys face off against Leia.  Aaron’s turn he completes test 2, stacks some Destinies and deploys Lando with test 1.  He then moves Leia to consolidate his forces and he’s done.  Since he only has 6 force left I don’t bother to battle, I just drain for 3 and let him lose one to S&amp;D.  At the end of my turn he plays Trooper Sabacc and makes me lose another 2, he then trys to battle but he only has 2 force left, b/c of great warrior he to activate both to battle, so he loses one to S&amp;D and I drain him out next turn.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 12<br/>
Highs: Not having Onn Nee Tay played against me, Laughing about Leia forgetting to move, invading Dagobah, watching Artoo play Sabacc.<br/>
Lows: Beating a Team Albany member, having to run away in fear of my own Zuckuss, overdeploying<br/>
<br/>
Game Three:<br/>
DS V.S. Joe Gagliardi Hidden Base X-Wing Swarm<br/>
<br/>
Again I am thinking fast flip so I can get S&amp;D out and start pounding away.  I pull a site and docking bay, activate and draw.  Joe starts Strike Planning and pulls Endor, then he drops a couple of X-Wings and moves for free to Endor.  I pull another site and Docking Bay and draw.  Joe pulls Aquirias and uses strike planning to get General Lando, then he uses squadron assignments to get gold one and drops those at them and moves to Endor.  I activate and pull a Docking Bay, This turn I have the force to flip but there are no sites in my reserve deck.  So I am forced to draw till I get a third site.  Joe’s turn he drains and drops more X-Wings pulls a system and moves Gold Squadern 1 over to Ralitier to prevent my flip.  I activate and count my force, I have 10 force, exactly enough to flip this turn. I drop Ardren, Arnet and Watts to three different sites, then deploy vaders shuttle to Ralitier and he Barriars.  My heart sinks b/c I knew I just made a mistake that would cost me the game.  With one force left I can’t reinforce the shuttle.  I suck it up and try and keep a poker face while he uses organized attack to search for 3 X-wings.  He drops some X-Wings with Lando and battles (beats the crap out of) my shuttle.  I lose the shuttle and 16 force.  After that the game is over, he deploys more systems and flips I deploy Vader and move Watts over to keep the drain of 3 going, I also get S&amp;D and start making him lose.  I get security precautions and begin to probe his systems, he manages to kill Boba in with an untracked 5 and Bossk, Zuckuss and the Devestator just weren’t enough to patch up the drains.  I kept it close by blocking drains but I couldn’t find his Hidden base so I was draining him for one and forceing him to lose 1 a turn but that’s all I could do.<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss By 10<br/>
Highs: Keeping my head up and in the game, even though I was sure I was going to lose I stuck with it and kept it close<br/>
Lows: Everything else, mainly playing like a scrub<br/>
<br/>
Game Four:<br/>
LS V.S. Steve Brentson’s court<br/>
We both started off normally, Steve stacked guys in the Audience Chamber while I tested.  I got out my Docking Bays and soon I have palace Raiders sitting on Tatooine with EPP Obi and EPP Luke chillin for support.  We battle back and fourth and eventually Steve comes out on top, pretty straight forward game, a lot of Hidden Weapons, Disarmed and Fallen Portal.<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss By 6<br/>
Highs: Playing a tight game against a great player, proving that I am perhaps an underrated player<br/>
Lows: Not being up to date on my rules and letting Steve draw destiny with Bossk in bus, Zuckuss in MH and an outer rim scout at a Docking Bay<br/>
<br/>
Game Five:<br/>
DS V.S. Josh Pateriti’s Profit<br/>
This was a great Game!! Josh starts General Solo as his Frozen Captive.  We both have bad opening hands so the first two turns are spent pulling sites and docking bays then drawing.  I play a bit more cautious b/c I know he has the tools to put the hurt on me.  I Draw Vader but hold him opting instead to flip with Tempest Scout 1, Tempest scout 5, Tempest Scout 3, Arnet, an AT-ST pilot and Lennox .  The Same turn he flips, with Ben, Master Luke, Blount and and Orko.  Then He gives Luke his stick moves Luke and Ben out.  I drain, search, pull Masterful Move deploy a ship w/an Imperial aboard and he goes.  He Drains and moves to the Tat DB with luke and obi.  I Drain, Search and play masterful move, I toss Ability Ability Ability at him and sit.  He drains, and Docking Bay Transits out to Ralitir across from Tempest scout 5 with an AT-ST pilot.  I activate but I can’t bring the six to the top, I drain and deploy Blizzard scout one across from Luke and Ben, then I add Cabbel and Evax.  He Barriars the Blizzard Scout, so rather then chance it, I don’t battle. I lose to Profit then he looks at my walkers, both of which can React.  He pays 8 and deploys Boussh across From Arnet in Tempest Scout 1.  He battles Arnet, I react with Tempest Scout 3 to the battle but leave Lennox behind We draw destiny and Leia covers, I send Tempest 2 to the lost pile.  Then he Battles with Luke and Ben.  We draw Destiny and I have a 2 with the +4 I have a six, so Luke goes and comes back.  Josh draws a 5 so I send Cabbel to the lost pile.  My turn I activate 4 and battle. Josh plays Gift of the Mentor and draws crap for his destinies, I draw my Masterful Move and by adding four I kill Luke and Ben.  I send Evax to the lost pile and lose a couple more force.  Then I move Blizzard scout one over with Lennox and Shuttle down Merijik from space.  His turn I lose to Profit then he draws.  On my turn I activate all but 2 and search.  2 and 3 are my destinies so I take one and do some random stuff to use force then let Josh go.  I Loses to Profit then he deploys Chewie and Ben and moves them out with Orko, leaving Han and Blount in the Chamber and sits.  I activate all but 2 again drain and search, this time I have a 4 and 2, I take the 2 and deploy DLOTS and Sim Aloo across from Han and Blount and battle.  He plays narrow escape and runs to Ben.  I move out with DLOTS and Sim and sit in front of his mains.  His turn I lose to profit and he moves Han and Blount back inside.  My turn I drain and chase Han w/Vader.  His turn I lose to profit and he drops Leia w/Anakins stick and with his last force moves Ben in w/Han and Blount.  My turn I drop David Jon and Battle.  I choke Han with the 4 and draw a 1 +3 for destiny.  He forfits Blount and brings him back I forfit David Jon to attrition than I move out to face Chewie and orko.  Josh then deploys a second Han from his hand back inside with Obi and blount and moves Chewie and Orko inside leaving Leia at the DB to drain.  I activate, Search and Grab Iggy and drain, unfortunately my destinys are both 2 so I can’t capture, I drop Iggy across from Han and move Sim and Vader in.  Josh makes me lose to Profit, drains w/Leia and han runs with Obi leaving a small force in the AC.  I make him lose to Ability Ability Ability (which I had forgotten to enforce).  I activate, search to check my destinies (good enough) and battle.  I choke and shoot (miss) and after destiny he has Orko and Chewie left and I forfeit Sim.  I then continue to pursue Han.  We now look and Josh has 9 force left, I have 7 and neither of us have hands.  He makes me lose 3 and drains one.  Then he makes the mistake that lost him the game.  He moves Han inside to protect him and Moves Orko out.  He says done and I make him lose to Ability Ability Ability then he realizes his mistake, but it’s too late.  I drain for 3 and move in front of Leia with Vader and IG-88.  I say done.  He makes me Lose 2 to profit, and that’s all he can do.  He ends his turn by losing 2 to ability ability ability and then I drain him out.  If you’re reading this Josh, Awesome game.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 1<br/>
Highs: Winning a really really tight game<br/>
Lows: Winning when I really should have lost, forgetting to enforce Ability Ability Ability.<br/>
<br/>
Game Six:<br/>
LS V.S. Chris Goglen’s SYCFA/Beat Down<br/>
This was just not my game; Chris draws the 3rd Marker and Dark Forest and dops Mara w/saber at the third marker.  I compete test one and put Projection down on the 3rd marker.  Chris then drops Lord Vader at the Dark Forest and I put projection down there too.  At this point I am feeling confident b/c both of the Big Mains are on the table, I deploy a couple of raiders and some Baragwins to the Tatooine Docking Bay w/EPP Obi as support.  Chris drops a slew of characters including Dengar.  Dengar shoots my speeder and I am forced to forfeit my raider and Baragwin (even though I reduced his attrition to nothing) from there Dengar just wrecked me, I kept deploying and drawing but I could not draw one of the 4 fallen portals in the deck.  So eventually I give up the Docking Bay and drop EPP Obi across from Mara.  I battle and even though over a third of the destinies are 4 or over I miss w/my saber swing and my destiny isn’t high enough to kill Mara.  She doesn’t draw destiny due to test 2 but next turn Dr. E comes down and he battles, He hit’s Obi and I hit Dr. E, again I draw a 3 so Mara stays Obi goes to the tank.  I draw him again and drop to battle, again I miss and draw low destiny.  At this point I am just frustrated, Mara hits Obi so he goes back into the tank.  Chris just drains at Cardia w/Boba and at my Docking Bay and puts down the back door and moves Vader over, I pick Obi back up and drop and a Palace raider in front of Vader and battle, I hit Vader and he draws low so I chuck the raider.  Now I have a drain of 2 but it’s too little too late, I am paying to Chris’s Battle plan and I just can’t recover, the last 4 cards to go from my deck are all Fallen Portal, I’m ready to cry, I don’t think more could have gone wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss by 15<br/>
Highs: Not a darn thing<br/>
Lows: The entire game<br/>
<br/>
Game Seven:<br/>
LS V.S. Marty Terwilliger’s Court/Scum<br/>
This game was a blur, I tested and Marty deployed a ton of guys and we went at it! My Palace Raiders swarmed over Tatooine supported by God Ben and EPP Luke and Martys Bounty Hunters and various other aliens battled right back.  The game ended with me tracking a Racing Skiff around to lose to Marty’s Drain then retrieving it with my Baragwin.  On my turn I was draining for one at Endor Docking Bay and using Figirin to retrieve another force.  Slowly my force pile was coming back, now and again Marty would drop and battle to retrieve a couple w/scum and force me to lose one w/First strike but for the most part I had a lock down.  Unfortunately I need another hour to win the game, the progression was slow.  Ted comes over and tells us we have 10 seconds left, I drain and retrieve and say go w/1 second left so we each get another turn.  Marty looks at the board and he is pretty sure he has lost but we both have pretty big piles.  I know he thought about drawing up and giving me the full win that I would have eventually obtained had we completed the game.  However he can’t be sure so he activates and battles retrieving 3 and making me lose one that my Baragwin retrieves for me.  We both forfeit and it’s my turn. I grab one more w/Figirin and battle retrieving one.  Below that is a racing Skiff and below that is a landing claw so I grab those w/my Baragwin.  We forfeit again and that’s game.  We count up and I have 27 to Marty’s 20.  As you can see there was still a lot of game left in both decks.  Great game Marty, I wish we had time to finish.<br/>
<br/>
Timed Win by 27<br/>
Highs:  Finally getting Figirin and boosting my retrieval<br/>
Lows: None, Both Marty and I played Flawlessly I just got a good jump<br/>
<br/>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Brian Terwilliger, Brain knew what I was playing card for card and he could have told his dad, and I think it would have made a big difference in the game.  Instead all he said was ‘Good Luck’<br/>
Thank You Brian<br/>
<br/>
Game Eight:<br/>
DS V.S. Kim Caton’s MWYHL/Space<br/>
This game was quick and painful.  Kim sets up and tests to 3 I set up and flip.  I am draining for 3 but paying to Battle Plan so I grab Kashyyyk and put Boba down.  Kim activates and draws a couple. I drain and drop the Executer and Vaders Shuttle at Kashyyyk I put DLOTS on the shuttle (planning to invade Dagobah) and a pilot on the Executer.  Kim comes after me w/Lando in Falcon and 2 red squad X-Wings one toting an X-Wing laser cannon.  She has 3 force after the Deployment so she battles for free and blasts Vaders Shuttle, Power Pivots the Executer and draws a 5.  I draw a 3 +3.  She reduces it by one and reduces the attrition further w/the Hut.  I forfeit my pilot and lose a few more force. Kim sends an X-Wing to the lost pile and Legendary Starfighter gets played.  My turn I apply the beat down.  I activate drain 3 and search.  I then drop Zuckuss and 2 pilots to the Executer.  I battle and draw a 3 +3, Kim gets a big fat zero thanks to Zuckuss and we total power.  I have 32 to Kims 10.  She sends both ships to the lost pile and loses 12 more and that’s game.  Kim’s got nothing left after that, so I just clean up in drains.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 25<br/>
Highs: Having 32 power, Causing 22 in battle damage.  Playing 4 games w/ROPS and never seeing Onn Nee Tay once<br/>
Lows: None, the game was too short for me to make a mistake<br/>
<br/>
So I finish 9 (+52)<br/>
<br/>
Well that was the tourney, I finished somewhere in the middle of the top and I happy with that.  We all cheer as Brian gets his trophy and then we go out to Spaghetti Warehouse for dinner.<br/>
