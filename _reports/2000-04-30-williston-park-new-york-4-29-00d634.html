<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I just got back from my latest tournament at Grasshopper's Comics in Williston Park and decided to write a report about the tourney.  There were 18 people including Scott Lingrell winner of the New Jersey state tournament which was cool.  All the regulars including Derek 'Datasta' Halpern, Matt 'I'M WRONG' Ehrhart, and Chris 'Wedge231' Wo@#$%a were there as well.  I paid my entrance fee and we were off.<br/>
<br/>
Decks:<br/>
<br/>
LS - A Falke style Hidden Base deck with my own modifications<br/>
<br/>
DS - A typical AT-ST Rops deck with a decent amount of trackable destinies to take further advantage of the objective.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS vs. Bucksun Lee's (1392) DS Hunt Down Non-Dueling deck.<br/>
<br/>
I start with Battle Plan and he starts normal HD stuff along with Security Precautions.  I started out by knocking out Visage on the 1st turn with Transmission Terminated.  I fetch my systems and look for Super Falcon elements along with EPP Obi and Luke.  I find EPP Obi and the turn after that, he deploys Lars Farm along with Mara w/Saber.  Obi takes her out next turn, and we continue drawing.  He twileks for Visage at the end of my turn, and proceeds to deploy DVDLOTS and Grand Moff Tarkin to Lars Farm and flips.  He also throws out another Visage which I try to TT, but he senses it.  I have to do something, so next turn I Tunnel Vision for Jeroen Webb and send him and EPP Obi to cancel Visage.  Bucksun gets this sour look on his face which is priceless.  However, next turn, he deploys Destroyed Homestead on Lars Farm and now I'm losing force and I'm not damaging him since Obi is trapped at the Executor: Holotheatre where he can't drain due to his flipped objective.  I get out a POAS on Lars Farm to cut the drain to 1 and on his turn, he deploys the Cantina and Jabba's Palace.  I see my opportunity, and throw Orrimaarko down at Jabba's Palace and EPP Luke at the Cantina to flip him back along with OTE.  He can't contest the drain of 4, so he moves toward Orrimaarko.  I get out a YT-1300 Transport with Wedge to run an OMDH to retrieve 6 which I pay 6 for since he has Secret Plans.  He attempts to battle me in space with Bossk in Bus, but I barrier him and he loses 3 to OTE.  By this time, time is running out on us, so I have to end it.  I deploy EPP Leia to the Cantina and move Orrimaarko there as well, and pick up a Clash of Sabers.  He moves to the site and ends his turn.  I Clash Vader and hit Tarkin.  He loses Tarkin along with 13 more, and that's game.    <br/>
Full Win by 19<br/>
<br/>
Record: 2 (+19)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Canceling Visage twice and seeing that look on his face.<br/>
Lowlights: Not being able to get a Falcon for the Super Falcon combo and Destroyed Homestead  damaging me for about 6 force when I had no way for Obi to get over there to cancel it.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS vs. Scott Lingrell's (1922) LS Throne Room Numbers with Suicide Mains.<br/>
<br/>
He starts normal Throne Room stuff and gets out Artoo along with a 1st turn odds.  I deploy a twix site and get the Swamp to Ralltir from reserve.  He deploys Battle Plan and the Rendezvous Point which Wars Not Make One Great goes on.  I activate and numbers pop so I lose 6.  I flip on the 3rd turn with 2 AT-ST pilots along with Cabbel and DS-61-2 at another site.  I also deployed another twix site as well.  He gets out 8-D8 and inserts again.  I activate everything and luckily numbers didn't pop up.  I fortify Ralltir a bit and let him go.  He brings down EPP Obi and Tawss Khaa along with Mechanical Failure, but I react over with another AT-ST and he loses Obi while I lose an AT-ST pilot.  Tawss moves over, and on the next turn,  I pull DVDLOTS with my objective, deploy him with his Saber, and proceed to beat on Tawss.  Scott loses Tawss, who was hit by the Saber, and 10 force as he drew a 1 for destiny.  Eventually I get out Kashyyyk along with ZiMH to satisfy Battle Plan which had been killing me thus far.  He deploys Tantive 4 along with EPP Luke to block the drain.  Numbers pop, and I lose another 6 force.  I deploy BFiS1 along with ZiMH, and battle making him lose EPP Luke and the ship while I toss ZiMH as he drew a tracked 5 for destiny.  For his last-ditch effort, he deploys RLIR1 to Kashyyyk to block the drain, but I battle with BFiS1 and draw a 5 that becomes an 8 to take care of him.  I alter WNMOG and proceed to drain him out.  It was a great game, and if Scott had drawn better destiny earlier, he probably would have won. <br/>
Full Win by 13   <br/>
<br/>
Record: 4 (+32)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Beating a good player and drawing 8 for destiny a few times.<br/>
Lowlights: Wars Not Make one Great and Battle Plan slowing me down tremendously early in the game<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS vs. Chris Wo@#$%a's (1600) LS Profit.<br/>
<br/>
This was an incredible game with a ton of strategy on both ends.  He starts Goo Nee Tay along with a frozen Han Solo while I go for Bad Feeling Have I.  I deploy the Hoth: Ice Plains, and he does nothing for the 1st 6 turns besides draw up as I flip on Ralltir with an AT-ST with a pilot, Lt. Commander Ardan, and some 2-2 scrubs.  I drain him for 3 for 3 turns and played a used Monnok twice to slow him down.  He frees Han with Orrimaarko and retrieves 10 flipping his objective.  I had prepared for this, and pulled Grand Moff Tarkin with the objective.  Next turn, DVDLOTS and Grand Moff Tarkin pay them a visit.  I miss the choke, but draw high for destiny and he loses both guys and a force while I remain unscathed.  His objective flips back, and I'm feeling pretty confident.  However, Chris was resilient and came back.  He deploys Order to Engage and Scramble which hurt later along with Boushh and EPP Obi to Lt. Commander Ardan's site.  I barrier Obi, and we have a mini-SAC war which I win so Obi can't battle.  I deploy Kashyyyk along with Vader's Shuttle and DS-61-2 and move Ardan away next turn, despite the OTE force loss.  He flips back by deploying EPP Han and Tawss Khaa to his Cantina and also throws down Master Luke with Tamtel Skreej at the Audience Chamber so now he has the edge.  I chase Han and Tawss with DVDLOTS and Tarkin while taking OTE damage in Ralltir and some damage from his objective.  Eventually, I get out Tempest Scout 2 with an AT-ST pilot and trample EPP Han to flip back his objective for the last time.  I start suicide fights on Ralltir to avoid OTE damage and he flips me back.  He gets out Ultimatum which reduces my drain of 3 at the Cantina to 2.  I finally alter OTE.  We both have very little force left, but after I drain him down to 1 card, he drains me for a couple and draws up to end it.  It was a great game and could have gone either was at the end.  Good game Chris.  <br/>

Game 4: My LS vs. Matt Ehrhart's (1845) DS ISB Big Blue.<br/>
<br/>
I'm ashamed of how scrubby I played this game, as my blunders cost me 2nd place.  I start Battle Plan while he goes for IAO.  I get out my systems, and he gets out Kiffex along with some twix locations.  I deploy Jeroen Webb along with EPP Obi and Yoda's Gimer Stick to his Imperial Square to drain.  At the end of my turn, he twilek advisors for the card which would eventually ruin me - Come Here you Big Coward.  On his turn, he deploys a Death Squadron Star Destroyer with EPP Vader, Grand Moff Tarkin, and an Outer Rim Scout to Chandrila to drain.  I get out the Super Falcon with a Landing Claw to block his drain along with GLiG1 with Wedge piloting to Tibrin.  He plays Those Rebels Won't Escape Us to cancel the claw and deploys 5D6-RA7 Undercover to block my drain at the Imperial Square.  He also plays Masterful Move (which I grapple) and lost monnoks me for 2 Rebel Barriers.  I get out another Claw, but he cancels it again with TRWEU, so I move the Falcon to Tatooine.  He also plays Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down to cancel my Bacta Tank which hurt.  I set up Our Most Desperate Hour, but then I realize that unless I have 2 battlegrounds, I'm not retrieving jack.  I have to wait until I deploy the Spiral and EPP Luke to Kashyyyk in order to get the force back.  I also deploy Tawss Khaa to get some more force back with OMDH.  By this time, he has another DSSD packed with Evax and an ORS at Chandrila as well which flipped his objective.  I eventually complete OMDH and retrieve 7 which got me back into the game as he had been draining me for 3-5 a turn.  I convert his Kashyyyk and move the Falcon over to Kashyyyk in order to force him to battle me or lose 3 as I'm holding I Know in my hand.  He initiates, and I draw a measly 13 in destiny with 5 draws which is horrible in my deck.  He pitches the whole ship, and I have to toss EPP Leia as he drew a 5.  We battle at Kashyyyk with his Mara Jade and ORS vs. my EPP Luke on the Spiral and I lose Luke while he tosses an ORS.  I then make another costly error.  I played A Few Maneuvers in order to track it and take out the DSSD at Kashyyyk.  I activate, deploy RLiR1 to Kashyyyk, and battle.  I draw destiny...EPP Luke!  WTF!  I lose GLiGI and he loses nothing.  I still have a chance though as I move RLiR1 to Tibrin.  If I can get back a Landing Claw, I might be able to block his drain and slowly drain him out elsewhere.  I draw up finding a Hyper Escape and 3 other cards to pitch to Tibrin next turn.  I save 1 force for the Hyper Escape, and he wonders why I didn't move away as he has the DSSD with Vader and Tarkin aboard at Tibrin as well.  He activates all but 1, uses IAO to see the last card, and advisors to get out...First Strike.  He seems pissed since now he doesn't have destiny, but than he realizes that he can play it and just kill me without drawing destiny.  He plays it, initiates, retrieves 1 and I lose 1, and it's over.  I didn't save 2 force for the Hyper Escape, and my 5 for destiny is canceled.  I lose the ship and 11 more to end the game.  The game took awhile, and some of these details are fuzzy, so I might have forgotten some stuff as well.  Matt played well and I just didn't.  Good game Matt.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I end up in 7th place which wasn't bad and get a Foil Death Squadron Star Destroyer and a foil Dutch in prize support which was pretty cool.  Derek won, Matt came in 2nd, Billy Hauser came in 3rd, and Chris came in 4th.  It was a fun tourney and I can't wait for the next one.  Also, I was checking out RamapoCon 2 which looks awesome, and even though I can't personally get there (see slops above), I hope everyone else there has a great time next weekend.  There are uncut sheets, hundreds of foils, T-shirts, and many other cool prizes as well. <br/>
