Hello All!!!<br/>
<br/>
   Well, I’m coming off my first ever first place yesterday so I decided to travel up to Phoenix to play in the regular Sunday tournament at Gamer’s Edge. Basically, I wanted to see if yesterday was a fluke or not. I arrive to the shop, and we have 9 players. All I want is to not get the bye. My last 2 trips to Phoenix have not produced very good results for me. I played good games, but I still went 1-6 (with a bye) during that stretch. But as my friend told me, ’Think positive and you’ll win." It worked yesterday...<br/>

LS - Yavin IV Mains and Toys<br/>
DS - Ralltiir Operations<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
DS vs. Aaron McCormick’s Mains Deck.<br/>
<br/>
   I think I played Aaron the tournament last week, but I don’t remember it very well. Either way, I know that Aaron is a good player so I’ve got to be ready for a tough game. He started with the Main Power Generators, the North Ridge, and A New Secret Base. I started with Ralltiir, Imperial Decree, Imperial Arrest Order and You Cannot Hide Forever. I also started with the Ice Plains and Fondor in my hand.<br/>
<br/>
   First turn I deployed the Ice Plains, Fondor and the Jungle because I couldn’t find the Swamp. For his first turn he searched for the Echo Docking Bay and War Room. He deployed both and Yoda’s Hut. By third turn I had my Objective flipped with and AT-ST pilot in Tempest Scout 1at the Swamp, Commander Merrejk at the Forest, and an AT-ST pilot in Tempest Scout 3 at the Jungle. He had deployed the ’Bantha’ Droid at the Echo Docking Bay, Dagobah, and Projection of a Skywalker at my Swamp and Jungle. He deployed Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight to the Forest and battled. I ’react’-ed with TS1 and drew a lucky destiny to remove Luke. He had also deployed Colonel Cracken in Tala 1 at Ralltiir. Next turn I deployed Boba Fett in Slave I to battle Cracken, but I drew a 0 (2 with Ralltiir Ops. flipped.) for my destiny, and he drew a 3. So Cracken got to stay. Next turn Melas deployed to the Swamp, and Captain Han in the Millenium Falcon showed up to beat up on Boba Fett and 6 extra Force. (Flipping my Objective back.)<br/>
<br/>
   Wedge Antilles Red Squadron Leader in Red Squadron 1 deployed to Kiffex along with the Admiral’s Order, I’ll Take The Leader. I deployed Bossk in Hounds Tooth, Dengar in Punishing One and Admiral Ozzel to battle him. He lost Wedge and ship, I lost Ozzel. Next turn he deployed the Liberty to Kiffex and General Calrissian to the Falcon. Then moved the Falcon over to Kiffex. I deployed Officer Evax to BinHT and battled. But he played Punch It! and cleared me off the system. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and Orrimaarko came to the Forest to face my AT-ST pilot in TS1, clearing Orrimaarko and my AT-ST. Lord Vader came down to clear the Forest. Eventually he cleared my AT-ST’s off Ralltiir and Vader was able to clear him off, but he was still draining me at Kiffex and Ralltiir. Full loss by 23.   0 (-23)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
LS vs. Dan McGrath’s Hunt Down and Destroy The Jedi deck.<br/>
<br/>
   I haven’t played Dan before, but the last time I lost with this deck it was to another Hunt Down dueling deck. And sure enough, he started Hunt Down (with Epic Duel), Imperial Arrest Order, Mobilization Points, and Secret Plans. I started with the Massissi Throne Room, Farm and Swamp. I also had a Nudj in my starting hand so I was able to start with one at the Swamp and the Farm. But I was unable to find a Revolution to slow his deck down.<br/>
<br/>
   For his first turn he deployed the Cloud City Docking Bay, West Walkway and Bespin. (I guess the Revolutions won’t help me that much any more.) I deployed Threepio and Obi-Wan to Mos Eisley. He deployed Emperor Palpatine and Janus Greejatus to the Docking Bay with Presence of the Force. I had Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight, Han w/, Luke w/, and a whole lot of ’hate’ in my hand so I was saving up Force. But next turn Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith with his lightsaber and Dr. Evazan deployed to Mos Eisley. He dueled Obi-Wan so I lost him and 9 more Force. (Flipping his Objective.)<br/>
<br/>
   Next turn I deployed Luke w/ to the Docking Bay. (Flipping his Objective back.) I played Clash of Sabers on the Emperor and he tried to Sense it, but drew a 4. So I continued with the ’hate’. Han w/, Bacta Tank, Demotion on Janus Greejatus, Draw Their Fire, and persona replaced Luke w/ with Jedi Knight. The destinies cleared the site (including the Emperor) and Han went to the Bacta Tank. The Chimera deployed to Bespin, and Admiral Piett went to Mos Eisley to move with Dr. Evazan to Obi-Wan’s Hut. During his move phase he brought Vader Back to his Hand. I deployed Momar Nadon to the Holotheater to cancel Visage and Han and Melas deployed to Obi-Wan’s Hut.  Clearing the site and sending Han back to the tank. <br/>
<br/>
   The next turn Vader w/ came down to duel Luke. Except he drew a 5 and 0 and I drew 2 5’s. Vader goes out of play, and I control the game from there. I spread out to drain, and fought off his remaining cards including another Emperor. Full win by 18.   2 (-5)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
DS vs. Brian Garrison’s Mains deck.<br/>
<br/>
   Brian is a great guy and a good player. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid this pairing in the past, but today it was not meant to be. At least I’m facing his Light deck, I don’t think I want to face his Dark deck.  He started with Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Your Insight Serves You Well. I started with my usual Dark side start. This game is looking surprising similar to my game with Mike Girard yesterday. (A game I only won because Mike let me lose Bossk in Hounds Tooth instead of the Jungle.)<br/>
<br/>
   So first turn I start with the Jungle. For his first turn he searches his Reserve deck and pulls out the Endor Landing Platform and deployed Daughter of Skywalker. For the next couple of turns we were setting up. Eventually I flipped my objective. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight deployed to the Forest but he drew a 0 for destiny so I didn’t have to use the Ghhhk in my hand. Be then moved to the Jungle to face my AT-ST with pilot. I was trying to set up Lord Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin, so I only moved away and saved Force. He deployed General Carissian and Nien Nub to the Falcon at Fondor and Orrimaarko joined Luke, but he forgot to move the Falcon to Ralltiir flip my objective.<br/>
<br/>
   So next turn I search for Vader and cleared off Orrimaarko. Luke then fled to the Forest and the Falcon moved over to Ralltiir. Bossk in Hounds Tooth, and Dengar in Punishing One cleared the pilots and themselves off the system. Vader and Tarkin moved to the Forest while the AT-ST moved to the Jungle. Leia w/ came down to clear that site. Next turn I deployed Tempest 1, but he played Rebel Barrier. So Vader and Tarkin fight Luke. Next turn Obi-Wan joins Luke, but Tarkin is canceling the lightsaber destinies and my characters are immune to attrition at the Forest. So Obi-wan and the walker go away. I deploy Commander Igar to the Jungle and Vader’s Lightsaber to Lord Vader at the Forest. Vader and Tarkin clear Luke. Melas came to battle Igar but I had an Imperial Barrier. Next turn Mara Jade cleared the site and then I drained him away. Full win by 19.   4 (+14)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
LS vs. Brian Garrison’s Bring Him Before Me deck.<br/>
<br/>
   As the pairing turned out, I ended up having to face Brian’s Dark Deck after all. Brian seemed to have more confidence in my Light side deck then I did. But I didn’t like the idea of not having my Luke to use in this game. That plus the fact I don’t play with Honor of the Jedi in this deck. But as Brian later told me, a lot of people don’t understand that I don’t have to just give up Luke. I just have to get him to a battleground site. He started with the Emperor’s Throne Room, Your Destiny, and Insignificant Rebellion. He also started with You Cannot Hide Forever, Imperial Arrest Order, and Mobilization Points. I started with my usual Yavin IV start, and again got the Nudj in starting hand but no Revolutions.<br/>
<br/>
   First turn I deploy my Nudj and draw up. He deployed Carida, Death Star II Docking Bay and drew up. I had some good cards in my hand, but I wanted to play cautiously so I drew up a few and saved Force. He deployed Emperor Palpatine and Janus Greejatus to the docking bay. For my turn I deployed Obi-Wan w/ to the Cantina. He deployed Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith to battled Obi-Wan. He played I Have You Know and Sense-ed my Warriors Courage. I swung my lightsaber and ’hit’ Vader. I then played Smoke Screen to win the battle and clear the site plus 4 Force. Lord Vader and Tempest 1 deploy to Endor: Forest Clearing. I search for my Luke w/ but he’s not in my reserve deck. So I deploy Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight to the Cantina and Obi-Wan and his lightsaber join him. He then deploys Bossk in Hound’s Tooth and Dengar in Punishing One to Carida. I deploy the Bacta Tank, the Millenium Falcon with Han w/ and Leia w/ to battle. My 2 destinies clear his ships and I send Leia to the Bacta Tank. A lucky Out of Commission sent DV,DLOTS out of play.<br/>
<br/>
   Zuckuss in Mist Hunter came down to battle my lone Han in Falcon. I ’react’-ed with Life Debt to deploy Chewie w/ from my Reserve deck, then I also ’react’-ed with the Spiral to get my destinies. In the end, he lost ZinMH and 14 Force, while I lost the Spiral. Mara Jade came to my Farm and killed a Nudj. Leia w/ deployed to battle and knock her off the Farm. That was about it. I spread to drain and there wasn’t anything Brian could do. Full win by 20.   6 (+34)<br/>
<br/>
I ended up with 3rd place and a few DS II packs. Brian wasn’t having a good tournament, but the prize support changed his whole opinion of the day. Pulling a Jedi Luke and Emperor within 5 packs of each other will do that to you. =) Congratulations to Chris Shaner for coming in first. Thank you to Brandon "The Greatest" Allen for running the event. Don’t worry, you’ll get that software program to work eventually. =) Thank you to Gamer’s Edge for hosting the tournament. Thank you to all my opponents for great games and thank you to everyone else there for making it a great tournament.<br/>
<br/>
I had a great weekend of Star Wars. I won my first tournament ever on Saturday and went 3-1 against tough competition on Sunday in Phoenix. I only wish I could go to DecipherCon and see just how far this lucky streak will take me. Oh well, I’ve really been practicing up for the Phoenix Grand Slam anyway. So I hope to see everyone there on Nov. 3-5.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to all Arizona players at DecipherCon! (SW and YJ)<br/>
