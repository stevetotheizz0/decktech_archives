<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I was Bloody Sick of Objectives!!! They were fun...to a point...they were good...for a while...they were the best...while they were new. But  now, it was time for something else. So I built me an anti-profit and...(sound the "Trumpets of Originality")...Throne room. Tah-Dah! But wait!

There you have it, my decks. At the time we got started it was like 5:45, Doug Taylor was running the show, and we had about 20-21 players there.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS V.S. Sean Estes Profit mains/Harvest<br/>
hehehe, Profit first game, sweet. My opening hand is average, I started with Jabba/Boelo, and soon they were backed by EPP Fett and Gailid. I also had No Bargain and Bad Feeling out, so Sean was getting jack for force. On top of that, I had 2 None Shall P@#$%es, and a barrier in my hand. It was looking good. And indeed it stayed that way. I got set up with Occupation soon, making him lose about 3 force turn. (It woul be an extra 3, but Brangus got ’lost’ at the Palace). I had dropped CHYBC, so Sean wad in trouble. He eventually drops EPP Luke, who is NSHP, then Tawss and EPP Obi follow. Obi is barried, and he just leaves them. My turn I drop ECC 4-Lom and battle. <br/>
<br/>
4-Lom targets Obi, but it gets "Deflected" and Obi swings and nails Jabba. EPP Fett can’t hit squat, I cancel his 5 (whew!) and draw like a 3 and 4. He gets cleared. After that battle he just draws for turns as he gets hit for like 6 after dropping Cantina for generation. He loses some Harvest so I’m feeling pretty confident Sean is getting discouraged.<br/>
<br/>
But in Sean’s defense, he wants to go out in a Blaze of Glory, so Master Luke drops in on the AU. Barrier. My turn I battle, blank him, draw I think a 6 and a 1, clear him out again after I cancel his destiny. He is taken down a few turns later.<br/>
Full Win by 29<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Playing Sean, he’s a cool guy.Just stomping on Profit!<br/>
<br/>
Lows: Little to no interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS V.S. Doug Harvilla’s Huntdown mains<br/>
Crap. I hate, Hate, HATE this deck!! Okay, my opening hand is full of beatdown red...but that’s like it. I do drop a twix, grab a nudj, then draw some good characters, but no Ben. Doug drops Sarkli to the farm, shutting me down next turn, then he draws and saves some force. My turn I activate what I can, another twix, another Nudj, then I save some force. <br/>
<br/>
Doug drops Premiere Vader to the DS Docking Bay with saber and flips, then Janus comes to back up Sarkli. My Turn I drop EPP Luke to Janus and Sarkli, battle, nail Sarkli, TFISWTO, and clear the site. I just draw, still no Ben. Doug just drains a couple turns while we both look for stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Finally I get Ben, and he and Orrimaarko go get some drinks in the Cantina with a saber, and drains are exchanged for a couple of turns, then EPP Luke is deployed to Vader. Doug plays PASOA, so that sucks. But, I know he has Tarkin and friends in hand, and he has no force, so I deploy DTF and battle. He hits Luke and draws a 2. I lose Luke and 3. <br/>
<br/>
Doug’s turn he drops Emperor and ECC Iggy to drain on Yavin. My turn Boushh goes to block the drain. Draw some cards. Doug then deploys Mara to the Cantina, battles, draws a tracked 7, I draw a 4 I think. Ben dies, and HD flips. The rest of the game is just me scrambling to catch up.<br/>
Full Loss by 24<br/>
<br/>
Highs: None really, not a very entertaining game overall.<br/>
<br/>
Lows. Same as the highs.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS V.S. Nick Heinbach’s Court-flip<br/>
My opening han rocks, a twix, Ben, Gift, and EPP Luke. I just draw for a few turns losing to his Obj. after POAS Vader at the AU. I wait till he leaves no force (like 4 turn) and then Ben+Luke go smack Vader, Luke is revived. Nick just draws and loses, then he drops the Rancor at his pit. Time to leave the AU. My next turn I move Ben/Luke to the Palace, and draw like all my characters. Nick then deploys Salacious Crumb, It-O and a Gammaroan Guard to Ben/Luke, but doesn’t battle. That was unfortuante for him. I Sorry the guard, then ECC Chewie, Boushh, Tawss, and Wedge all go down. DTF comes out, and since he has no force, he loses the 2 characters and 20 force! Game, pretty much.<br/>
Full win by 29<br/>
<br/>
Highs:I haven’t done one huge beatdown in a while, felt good.<br/>
<br/>
Lows: More non-interaction basically.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS V.S. Hans Petter’s HB/EBO/Kessel Runs/Freigt Caps<br/>
He leaves me alone for like 6 turns while he gives me hella force from like 5 systems and I get set up with a 6 force hit a turn fairly soon. Then, out of nowhere, he drops MGP, 4th marker, 3 Echo sites, and then EBO! Damn. Well, it didn’t help that much, as he had m@#$% cards on table and I still had only 1 card in lost pile (I forget from what).Soon though he drops a Freighter Captain and Kessel Run. He moves the dude to Kessel, and I don’t kill it. My turn I drop ZiMH, ECC 4-Lom and Jabba’s barge (for fodder) and battle. he Hyper Escapes and completes the run since CHYBC is not out.<br/>
<br/>
To save your retnas some energy, it just wasn’t enough. I started hitting him for 11 a turn (Gailid at AU,Djahs at Dungeon with a presence, Brangus at the workshop, Mara with her Saber at the Palace, then 1 from the system). So, I hose him.<br/>
Full Win by 24<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Bearting a deck-type I’m afraid of.<br/>
<br/>
Lows: Once again, not much interaction.<br/>
<br/>
I finish 6(+62) and come in 3rd behind Doug Harvilla who went undefeated, and behind the winner, Joe Olson who also went undefeated but had like +140 something I think.<br/>
