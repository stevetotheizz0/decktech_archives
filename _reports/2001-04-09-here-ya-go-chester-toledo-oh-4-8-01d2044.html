<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">well i dont have any decks made and after playing the same stuff since feburary its time for a change. states is 2 weeks away and i gotta get some games in. i have many choices of decks for both sides. dark= mkos mains, hunt-down imp command, bhbm troopers, e-ops big blue, or tie swarm.  light= trm, tigih scouts, agents swarm, or hbx.  <br/>
so we get to the tourney really early and i should make some decks, but instead i play raw deal.  then i playtest a few decks with chester. my wb jawa pack tech puzzles him.  so now i have 12 minutes to make 2 decks.  well i go to my ls deck and grab the tigih scout deck, switch in a spaceport db (good to get to tat vs mkos).  dark i grab the e-ops deck...then i make the mkos deck... and then i decide that i’ll play the hunt-down imp command deck so i grab it but its 20 cards short so i’m throwing in random.cards, and put in my final mara as pairings are called.<br/>
<br/>
1. hunt-down vs matt white rst BLOW up bunker<br/>
well i setup fast with vader at a db and chiraneau in chimaera in space. visage is doing its share of damage.  he brings down rebel crap luke and a stick, so i bring mara and mabey janus nd kill him so i flip my objective again.  he drops deactivate the sheild generator and i get a little worried.  but then i remember that i have the jumbo hunt-down, and (according to chester) the jumbo hunt-down doesnt lose.  so i look at deactivate the generator and it says he has to control it to blow it up.  he has dos and epp obi at the bunker. i have hunt-down flipped.  so ya know what happens? i drop mara and xizor there, he cant battle, he cant control it, he cant blow it up. and blow up decks that cant blow up stuff have trouble winning.  FW 2 (+21)<br/>
<br/>
2. deck that starts luke vs andrew brown ROPS<br/>
i start ounee ta. yay. he doesnt go after luke at all, so i get a drain of 2 at endor db almost the whole game.  i go after him on ralltiir fast.  we have 2 big battles and they are kinda close, but rebel leadership and insertion planning help me win them and he stacks 2.  he is draining for 2 or 3 but so am i , so we are pretty even but he has more lost cards.  he tramples every scout i have with his like 4 tramples.  late ganme i bring leia vs palpy and draw a 6 to his 4, so he stacks another card.  now i have 3 stacked, so i decide to bring luke over to get captured by vader.  i try to cross him but draw low and dont (it was a 45 i needed a 6).  i stack a 4th card. on the edge to get back 5, then try to cross vader and draw a 4, +14=18=vader is mine=i win. FW 4 (+42)<br/>
<br/>
3. luke deck vs ricky wheeler ROPS<br/>
i start ounee ta.  he nabs luke turn 1.  turn 2 i bring crackin and epp obi vs his random scrub at executor db, he loses mabey 7 and stacks 1.  turn 3 i bring madine+ solo+ scrub vs his piett and dresolyn.  battle, isertion plan, rebel leadership, draw 2 6’s, he loses a bunch and stacks another.  the game is basically out of reach for him now, bbut we have some fun. we battle again and we tie.  from there i just drain him out, this game was pretty fast. FW 6 (+76)<br/>
<br/>
4. hunt-down vs adam huber tigih scouts<br/>
well if i win by a good amount i take the tourney, if not chester does.  unfortunently, huber is a good player and never usually loses by a lot.  i flip fast and setuup vader + tarkin + stick at the ds db.  i setup chiraneau in space.  he gets spys to kill visage, and we have some fights there. i stack a card or 2 but kill some of his guys.  he only drains for 1 at wndor db, but has invaded executor with alot of guys draining for 1 or 2 here and there.  mara, xizor and thrawn fight it out on the executor with random scouts and such.  i get out palpy and janus to a db and can now drain for 6 so i have a clear advantage in the drain race.  so i just drain him out, and last turn gio to endor to stop his drain.  FW 8 (+91)<br/>
<br/>
so i win which is cool. chester went 4-0 also but i had higher dif.<br/>
