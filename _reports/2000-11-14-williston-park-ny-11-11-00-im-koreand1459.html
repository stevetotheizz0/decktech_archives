Okay, I have only been to 4 tournaments since DSII so I have been having trouble winning games. I went 1-3 last tournament and now after seeing my rating drop 40 points I want to do better. My Spaceport Speeder deck from last time was original and kinda fun but just not competitive enough for me so I try out New Age Throne Room and EBO X-wings. For dark I switched from BHBM to Hunt Down but then changed my mind at the last second to Scum. I start fooling around with decks that week and I figure EBO X-wings will do well in the BHBM environment and for dark I test out Court the night before and it doesn’t work too well so I switch to SYCFA Scum.  <br/>
<br/>
The night before I went over my friend’s house and we played Team Fortress Classic and some Counter Strike so I didn’t really get to do any testing. Wait, nobody plays near me anyway so it doesn’t matter. So the next day I wake up and get my decks ready and then around noon I leave for the store. <br/>
<br/>
I arrive and give Billy Hauser the cards he needed from me and that is cool. I see him and Bucksun Lee working on MLB Showdown decks. I had just started collecting these that week and had pulled a Jeter so I traded it to Buck for a bunch of SWCCG rares I needed. I play a quick game with Buck and he kills me Skrilling CCT deck but I can’t say I was really trying. Some people show up and soon we are starting. 10 people entered the tournament and my rating going into it was 1664 (dropped 39 points in one tournament!) <br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My SYCFA Scum Vs. Billy Hauser’s (1682) DSII RST Deck<br/>
Well, he is using his DSII Closed Environment deck so I start No Bargain, Oppressive Enforcement, and You CAnnot Hide Forever to his Strike Planning, Sqaudron Assignments, and some other effect. I set up with the Audience Chamber and Mosep and Mighty Jabba there. He sets up with Madine and scouts. He drops Orrimaarko to the Death Star and moves to the War Room so I just send suicide guys down there for retrieval but learned this was stupid but oh well. I drain at 2 JP sites and he drains on Endor. He goes to my Death Star but I beat him off with bounty hunter ships and he retreats to Endor. I do some suicide runs on Endor but Insertion Planning messes up my plans. He just drain with Midge and I lose by 6, close game.<br/>
FL 0(-6)<br/>
Highlights: Making it close<br/>
Lowlights: None except losing but it was a fun game I guess<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My EBO Vs. Billy Hauser’s (1682) DSII BHM Deck<br/>
Same story this time. He is using a DSII deck. He sets up with Palpy and Janus but TK-422 blocks the drain and I set up EBO slowly. He drops Vader and EPP Luke comes down and I drop Honor somewhere along the line. He tries to spread and Boussh blocks his other drain. Early on he plays Monnok lost on me to take out 4 X-wings. My Bantha droid with How Did We Get Into This Mess? helps me get stuff out and I have X-wings at Kiffex I think. I drop a lot on his Star destroyers and stuff and I play Organizd Attack and I lose some stuff. We battle back and forth there and I get out Legendary Starfighter and he loses to his objective and that and I lose 1 to his duels. I finally get a Hyper Escape and for 2 turns I drain at Hoth for 3 and block his at Kiffex and move away with my Hyper Escape. His Executor is stuck at Kiffex so he just stays there. Colonel Davod Jon goes down to North Ridge for a drain and he spreads in space to block my drains and he is left with only Executor at Kiffex. I All Wings Report In for 7 late in the game and he drains for 1 and does duel damage for one and then I win by 3. <br/>
FW 2(-3)<br/>
Highlights: Another fun, close game<br/>
Lowlights: None<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My EBO Vs. Ben Daria’s (1632) BHBM<br/>
Usual BHBM start for him and he spreads to docking bays but my Boussh and TK-422 take care of that. I give Vader EPP Luke but I deploy Echo Base Garrison and he Alters it so I can’t get EBO out and he is just losing one and occassionally gets a drain through. The Executor goes to Kiffex with Zuckuss and are met by several X-wings and I shoot down Zuckuss with X-wing Cannos but fail to take out the Executor. He loses some overflow to that. He is stuck at Kiffex though and drops Bossk in Ship there. I drain at Hoth and he loses one to his objective. I get out EBO and eventually take out his ships. I proceed to drain him out and play a late game All Wings to retrieve some. Win by 14.<br/>
FW 4(+11)<br/>
Highlights: Fun space battles<br/>
Lowlights: Took me too long to set up<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My SYCFA Scum Vs. Bucksun Lee’s (1625) TIGIH<br/>
I set up and drain with Mosep at the Audience Chmaber and he spreads on Endor and drain for 2 a turn to my 1. He tries to send General Solo and Chewbacca of Kashyyyk to Jabba’s Palace but I None Shall Pass Chewie but have no characters in hand. I eat the drain of 2 and next turn None Shall Pass Chewie again. He Senses it. I come down with 4-Lom, Evazan, and Dengar with Gun and operate on Chewie but he plays Rebel Leadership to take out someone. I track a Masterful Move to Sniper Jedi Luke with IG-88. Mara and saber go to the Cantina and he sends Boussh and Jeroen Webb to the Audience Chamber to clear out my guys with a destiny of 6. He cancels my Scum and Villainy. He goes to my Death Star with ships and I try to fight him off but can’t. He finally beats up my ship for some overflow. I get drained out. Lose by 17.<br/>
FL 4(-6)<br/>
Highlights: None except Snipering JK Luke<br/>
Lowlights: Losing to Buck, he is annoying<br/>
<br/>
So our prize support is 2 CC packs for everyone. I come in somewhere near the bottom and Brad vogel takes first. I once again do bad but oh well. I will probably get to the tournament on the 25th and that oneis DSII Closed. Cool!<br/>
