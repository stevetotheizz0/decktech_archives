<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After missing out on the opening night of the tatooine release i wasnt too happy and so i had to settle for going to the sunday slop.When i arrived the td said that the sealed decks that were held on Wednesday and Friday were not raving successes and he didnt expect to get an overwhelming amount of ppl.I purchased two boxes of cards and as I waited for ppl to roll up i began to open packs expecting the Qui-Gons and Mauls to roll in!To my suprise after opening 72 packs i found myself with an AI Maul and two Obi’s(not a good start to the tournament).I began to make my decks with the only character with ability greater than four being obi.So as the match ups were being read out all i had to rely on was my razor sharp wit yeh well soughta hehe...he AND my expert playing skill well almost expert.<br/>
<br/>
game-1 vs. Jared Brown 2(+3)<br/>
By some cruel joke of god i found myself up against a podrace start and i (not having anakins racer) had to lose six force and my opponent retrieve six which with a forty card deck on the fifth turn hurt quite alot if you know what i mean (punch/gut/ouch).But due to the ability of the slave quarters/shmi/threepio combo i was drawing five and sixes every battle.I was on top till i put the mon cal. that let him put near his hole hand which was all 5’s and he destroyed my pitiful little band and i took 7 battle damage.I spread out with my only chance to win and lucky for me he didnt have anymore characters and i scraped home with the win.<br/>
<br/>
game-2 vs. Bjorn 0(-6)<br/>
From the start i was on the back foot with him deployiny maul and his saber on the third turn draining over all my little aliens.I tried an early ditch effort to dispose of a small group at mos espa but he drew a 1 and i had placed the six and he used takeel to switch destinies and i lost everthing except shmi and an eopi.As i frantically searched for my sole character of ability greater than 4 he spread out a bit too thin and i was able to really spank him and get some cards back.Not a very enjoyable game just big drains too early to compete with &lt;sob&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
game-3 vs. Tyng 2(+23)<br/>
This was going to be my game as i picked up obi in my starting hand.I was able to get the shmi combo started early and i killed him in a war of attrition.He seemed to be playing a beatdown deck(with what he had to beat with)but at every battle i drew a six and took great mounds of characters off the table.He could not get his sites out so there was no where to run and wherever he went obi relocated and he just ran out of characters.<br/>
<br/>
game-4 vs. Lisa West 2(+10)<br/>
Again i found myself against the foul smelling ugly podracing.This time around Lisa deployed wattos box and caused me to lose 11 cards which hurt even more (kick/balls/OUCH) but luckily for me there was nothing much behind that and after the dust had settled i just plinked drained her into extinction with shmi and threepio at the podrace bay and obi at the outer skirts.Another uninspiaring game that showed a pretty good reflection of how tatooine seasled decks go.<br/>
<br/>
I finished quite well coming second for the light but overall this was not the greatest tourney i have ever been too though it was good to get the feel of the new tatooine cards and how they function in tournament play.<br/>
