<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After months of waiting we finally had our first tournament in Findlay. We were all anxious to play. the type for thiis game was reflections 2  booster draft, with the 6 battle grounds.  The turnout was 10, not bad but there could have been about 15 but some people were busy. <br/>
<br/>
i am dark side and i draft for cards to win with, as opposed to drafting for rares. it was a good thing i didn’t try drafting for rares, as all the good ones went to the other player at my table. he got foil palpy, foil epp vader, guri, xizor, thrawn, baron, and more.  so i drafted anyway and this is the deck i played. i used the same cards in all 4 games.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
...so we play...<br/>
<br/>
Game 1. the horde vs. joe ’s ls pile<br/>
well joe was next to me in the draft and he got nothing and sio he went for the foils. he starts slow, hust activating and drawing. first turn my stinger hits his tatooine system. it drains there for a few turns. he comes to fight but i barrier. i setup a drain at the judland wastes and land the stinger there, to avoid the beats. i save up and drop thrawn, death squadron star destroyer, dr e., and some fodder and fight in space. the liberty goes to his used. i then fly up the stinger to join the action. we have mabey 3 or 4 battles in space, and i win them all and kill all his guys thanks to thrawns double destiny draws. late game he deploys yavin 4, and i fly stinger over there for a bigger drain. drain him out next turn.<br/>
FW 2(+18)<br/>
<br/>
hi: win + i’m in first<br/>
lo: joes new to the game so it wasnt fun beating him<br/>
<br/>
game 2. the horde vs john groman’s cc beats<br/>
well he starts the casino and gets off to a slow start, while i get off to another fast start and drain on his locations. the cloudcar is useful to protect my key people. <br/>
we fight back and fourth but my horde has too many characters and he can’t kill them all. thrawn takes over bespin because hey, he can. he tries to fight with dash and chewie and melas but they cant withstand the horde of guys i throw at him. i won this one because i kept drains up and was fighting him at the same time.<br/>
FW 4(+39)<br/>
<br/>
hi: win<br/>
lo: overdeploying, thus reducing my differential<br/>
<br/>
game 3. the horde vs johns cc mains (again)<br/>
we both start the same stuff. i get off to a fast start again. he sets up a good sized force at the cc:db and i’m a bit worried. we fight there and its close, back and fourth till the blaster hits the table, and now all his guys are becoming forfiet = 0 so i’m killing off more people. i’m holding my ghhhk, so i setup a lone alien + bantha at the judland wastes to drain. he plays a z95 to kessel, so i move the dssd w/thrawn over to it. he cant run because he has no hyperdrive, so i battle and make him lose 12. that hurts him, and i mean a lot. i kill off all his guys on cc and drain him out.<br/>
FW 6(+60)<br/>
<br/>
game 4. the horde vs johns cc mains (yes the same guy, 3rd time)<br/>
for old times sake we start the same stuff. i go into this game knowing i gotta win by alot to ijnsure my victory, or else i will lose. so i draw my starting hand, it has: omni box, vader, cloudcar, pondos gun, and 4 random guys. so i start off draining early. i dont draw a single card all game. i cycle my ommni bbox through my deck. i fight with all the junky aliens and kill off some stuff. he then spreads thin, annd at one site has 2 guys and only 3 ability, so i drop the dvdlots i’ve been holding. fight, choke, draw destiny, make him lose a whole bunch of force. the next 4 turns i slowly drain for 2, and 1, and that does him in.<br/>
FW 8(+92)<br/>
<br/>
hi: i win the tourney!! never drawing a card!! win by 32 with a 40 card deck!! <br/>
lo: he just got jacked by me, sorry john. also i was mad i had to play him 3 times<br/>

so i win and get the foil jap vader.<br/>
