<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Yeah we went. (see Booster Pack Seattle, Wa 4.20.02 to get the back story) After getting up late me and Casey tried to talk Earl in the fact that we needed to go to Kelso and hit this tournament. Earl was still not convinced. I told him that if it started at 1 and it was only four games at an hour each and it took five hours to get home, we would be back by 10. No problem. Earl didn’t believe me. After Casey started bugging him about it too he caved in but made Casey drive so he could make some new decks. I guess Earl really wanted a first place victory after getting 5th in Seattle. So around 10:30 we leave. <br/>
Casey’s driving is making Earl nervous (hey the guy street races his RX-7 every chance he get, he made me nervous). We get on I-5 and just head south. This trip would provide to be A LOT easer than the drive to Seattle. Earl makes his deck, I listen to more Alice in Chains on 107.7 THE END, and Casey drives at 85 MPH. Earl kept saying "I have a bad feeling about this." but me and Casey just ignore him. What could go wrong? We pass great towns like Headquarter, Jackson (Samuel L.), a town that looked like Outrider but it was Oustriden, and Vader. After these many Star Wars related themed towns we took them as a sign of good luck. <br/>
Around noon we get on the exit for Kelso. Now all we need to do is find Allen St. Head to the stop light... hey its Allen Street. Ok that was easy enough. Now just have to find Outpost. Two block later, there it is. Park, hear some weird hick music under a bridge, and run into the Outpost. The Outpost is very cool. The lady who owns it doesn’t carry sports cards so its nothing but Card Games. I get some good deals and end up with two cheap Cloud City Boba Fetts. Me, Casey, and Earl talk to one of the guys, Justin. Soon after he labels us the winners. That’s cool. The rest of them show up and there are 8 people total. The TR wasn’t going to play but he does at the last moment so we wait for him to make some decks. <br/>
I pay my three to get in and at 2:00 we start.<br/>
<br/>
Game #1 My Dark against Elfy’s Light<br/>
I whip out my Endor opps and Elfy gets out... nothing? No objective? Well ok. The kid is about 14-15 and doesn’t see, to know the game that well but he can play so its cool. Soon after the game stars I hear a "What the Hell?" Turns out Earl put in a bunch of "I have a bad feeling about this" instead of "It could be worse". I laugh and Earl curses. Anyways back to the game I start with Perimeter Patrol on my bunker and get Navy Trooper Fenson there quick. He is going for space drains so i try to get him to go to Endor. He put Mace down with a few of my bikers and such. He doesn’t battle. Next turn I put down Maul a few AT-STs and Relentless Tracking on Mace. I don’t battle. He is only force draining for 2 each turn so I wait for a bit to flip my objective (well that and I didn#t have any more sites down yet) after about three turns of me not killing his Mace I finally go in for the kill. (he had Han Chewie and the Falcon at Endor and I wanted it gone) Mace is dead and i let him do his force drains. Next turn I deploy back door, forest clearing, some AT-STs, and the Death Star Assault Squadron at Endor. I put down Establish Secret Base and Ominous Rumors. Flip my objective and battle his Falcon at Endor. I play All Power to Weapons to give me 18 power. He draws a 0 and a 4 for destiny. Too bad for him my objective lets him have only one and the 0 was his first. His Falcon is gone and stays away for the rest of the game. next turn I for drain for 7 at Endor and 7 at the sites. I win with a +24.<br/>
<br/>
Game #2 My Light Against Earl’s Dark... damn it!<br/>
Why did I have to go against Earl??? Why does God hate me so? Why is Earl now doing Bring him Before me? Well my MBO was up to it, haha. Well um this is how quick the game is (I knew Earls trademark combo so i just let it happen.) A few turns in Earl Ellos himself to Yavin with Lord Vader and three stormtrooper garrisons, battles my Rebel tech and plays Trooper Assault, and Dark Jedi Presence. Ok, three power 20 guys Lord Vader and two BDs. Good bye hand, force, used, and reserve piles. Game over. I lose with a -32. Thanks Earl.<br/>
<br/>
Game #3 My Dark Against Kelso Kid 1’s Light.<br/>
I ask him if he is ready and he just says no. Well... ok. Endor opps again against LSC. I get Vader down first turn and that screws me up later. The game is nothing but me force draining him at Endor and him force draining me at Naboo. I flip my object though and that’s when we wants to send down Lando Scandral. He can’t battle and has to lose one from Perimeter Patrol. He battles a turn later and I react with half my Endor Army. Apparently he didn’t know I could do that. I kill off his Lando and the rest of his force. I win with only a +4, I had no idea I had that little.<br/>
<br/>
Game #4 My Dark Again against.... EARL!!!! DAMN DAMN DAMN!!<br/>
Well it was the days best Dark against the days best Light. There is good in him against Endor opps. Earl use the Signal to put Light Saber Proficiency on Luck so he is force draining for two right off. I don’t want this so I get Vader down to get Luke. Earl didn’t think I would. So now Earl doesn’t want his Luck captured. He sends down Orrimaarko, Panaka, and Padma and battles my Vader. I choke Panaka and kill off Padma with my BD of 4. He draws a two so no worry for me. Next turn I battle and choke his Orriammarko. A bad things happens though. Jar Jar goes to the Bunker and Earl battles me three times! I lose by one each time. So that means he gets three cards for I feel the Conflict. For five turns all he has to do is draw a 6. He can’t. All the while my Vader is kicking ass. He wins another battle though and now all he needs is a three... damn it. He draws a three his next turn and my Vader is now good. Well I lose but it was the best game I played in months. Fun and Earl only won by 17.<br/>
<br/>
Results<br/>
Earl 1st losing to no one<br/>
Casey 2nd losing once to Earl<br/>
Me 4th losing twice to Earl<br/>
<br/>
So The three of us weren’t beat once by the Kelso guys but then again none of us played the TR. I got a Reflections 1 pack with a folio Han Solo that I traded for a Mara Jade.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home we almost ran out of gas and it was raining. Raining is ok as long as your windshield wipers are working good. They kept flying off the window and too the sides where they couldn’t get back on. So Earl had to get out 4 or 5 times to put them back on. We get home sometime around 1 or 2 and I go to bed to get ready for school that day... stupid school.<br/>
