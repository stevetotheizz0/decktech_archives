<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Hello all, and welcome to my first ever tournament report for Star Wars...<br>
<br>
The night before the tournament, I stayed over at Clay Ramey's (SadisticJawa) place to get some playtesting in for the money tournament the following day. I decide on my two decks, and after building them, we stayed up for a long time playtesting them...<br>
My decks:<br>
LS: HB Inserts with 12 XWings, 4 YT1300s(to hold insert characters), Tibrin, one insert, and 4 Signals. If the opponent plays a lot of anti-insert, I am not incredibly shafted. I also used the 0,1,2,7 spread in my systems, using Clak'dor VII as my hidden base.<br>
DS: (Drazin Bran)CCT Manip with eight Scanning Crews, 2 Drazins and Special Deliveries, and no A Dangerous Time. Without A Dangerous Time, I am not as screwed against Scrambled Transmission, as I ran three catch cards for Shocking Information.<br>
<br>
On to the tournament.. There were 14 people in attendance, with the cash prize being 50$.<br>
<br>
Game 1: (younger player, I don't quite remember his name)<br>
My LS v. His DS CCT to flip<br>
<br>
My LS deck has no Rebels, so he gets to see my deck. He starts with Security Precautions. (He only saw one insert, and he must have thought that I was only gonna play it once...) I start with Yarna.<br>
He goes, gets Audience Chamber and Jabba the Hutt (once-per-game). I get Clak'dor VII from deck, drop Bothawui, and draw up to 12. He drains, gets Ugloste from reserve with Carbonite Chamber Console, drops him with two Ugnaughts at the Carbonite Chamber. I Signal for my insert, drop the Tantive at Rendezvous Point with Artoo, Wioslea, and Figrin D'an, and insert. I get Tibrin from reserve, and draw one. He drains me for 1 and 1. He activates all, and no insert. He drops the Downtown Plaza and drops Brangus there. I activate, Signal for Battle Plan, and wager. I win the wager, and the insert comes up. He loses 10(including four! ships), and I retrieve a Signal. I drop Kiffex from Reserve and Kirdo III and Battle Plan from hand. I drop 2 XWings at Tibrin with two Rebel Barriers and an Organized Attack in hand. I draw the last four cards in my force pile. He activates, pays to drain for 1, 1, and 2. He saves force and says 'Go.' I activate my first 3, Signal for Wars Not Make one Great, activate the rest, and win a wager, retrieving an XWing. I drain for one, trade a Rebel Barrier, Wise Advice, and catch card for my insert. I insert again, get Coruscant from reserve, drop 2 XWings there,drop Wars Not Make One Great, and draw, getting my Rebel Fleet and Traffic Control. He activates all, and the insert comes up. He loses 10, including another ship. I flip, and he pays 12 to drain me for one. He drops the Port Town District, and moves an Ugnaught over to it (I lost 2 EPPs to Force drains earlier in the game). I activate, win a wager, and drain for four, paying 8. I drop Traffic Control, Rebel Fleet, and two XWings each at Bothawui and Kirdo III. I save 1, and say 'go.' He activates, draws six. I activate, win another wager, drain for a whole lot, and trade Transmission Terminated, Clash of Sabers, and a catch card for an All Wings Report in. I dump all of my hand but a Barrier, 2 XWings, an Organized Attack, and my All Wings. He activates, drains, drops CC Inincerator, moves the 2nd ugnaught there. I activate, drain for as much as I can, drop both XWings, AWRI for 10, and dump my hand. He can't do a whole lot, so he draws up.<br>
Full win by 29.<br>
<br>
Game 2: Andrew Morris<br>
My DS v. His LS Drazin Hate-CCCelebration<br>
He gives me Jeroen Webb, and starts Bespin and Don't Tread on me, with Scrambled Transmission and Do or Do Not. I start with Oppressive Enforcement.<br>
I get Audience Chamber and Jabba the Hutt. He drops Leia's Hut and North Corridor. I scan on his turn, he Shocks, I catch. I move EPP Luke to used pile. He has Captain Han and a Red Leader (not with Red 1) in hand with a Noble Sac. He drops the two characters to the North Corridor. I contest with Bane and Zuckuss. We both draw 3's. I lose Bane, he loses Red Leader. He drops Harc Seff and Yoxgit at Leia's Hut, and a Bothan Spy at my Security tower (adjacent to Han). He moves Han with the spy. (WAY TOO MANY GUYS in his deck). I drop Miyoom, and he Noble Sacs..(I did see that coming, but it was necessary.) I Scan, he catches, I miyoom, he shocks. There's not a whole lot I can do, as he gets CCCelebration going for 4 a turn, while I can only drain for 2. I draw up<br>
Full Loss by 33<br>
<br>
Game 3: Stephen Michael<br>
My DS v. his LS mains<br>
He gives me Wedge, and starts Obi's Hut and Scrambled, I start Opressive Enforcement.<br>
I get Audience Chamber from reserve and draw for a catch card. He drops Jabba's Palace, I lose one, and he draws. I scan on his turn, he shocks, I catch (Theme here). I drop Drazin and Special Delivery. I activate the Delivery(for Twi'lek, Monnok, and SCrew), but I forget all about deploying Imperial Arrest Order (d'ohh). He drops Ben at his hut, and Nabruns over. He drops a saber and battles. I lose Drazin and 5. I drop Zuckuss and M'iyoom to Jabba's Palace and move to the hut. He frees Wedge, and drops a B'omarr Monk for the drain at the Cantina and an Arcona at the Hut. I drop EPP Fett and Tarkin to the Cantina. I battle, I hit the Monk, and draw a 2. He loses Monk and 11(he drew 0). We exchange a lot of drains. I stack some destiny and fight Ben Kenobi and Wedge with EPP Vader. I swing at Wedge and hit, and draw a 5. He swings, hits, and draws a 4. He loses both, I lose Vader. as he catches my SCrews, and he shocks my m'iiyooms away, so I have to pile my SCrews and concentrate on the drains. We had been trading drains all game, and he was ahead by a few force. He used his previously-deployed Traffic Control to put some cards back. I drain, then I pay 7 to SCrew him. He has 2x EPP Han, EPP Leia, and Chewbacca. I make him drop Leia, and I drop Sir Chokes-a-lot to the Jundland Wastes (DS). He drops Han and Chewie against EPP Fett and Tarkin. He draws 5,6 after hitting Tarkin, I missed Chewbacca and drew 2,3. That basically decided the game, as he drained for two while I couldn't drain at all.<br>
Full Loss by 7<br>
<br>
Game 4: Stephen Michael (this shouldn't happen, but apparently there were a lot of DS losses that game)<br/>
My LS v. His Ominous Rumors.<br/>
I know that I have some advantage this game.<br/>
He starts Security Precautions, I start Yarna.<br/>
He gets Ominous during his control phase, and he Twileked for Resistance. He deploys them both and is done. I get Clak'dor VII, and I set up a YT1300 with Figrin and 8D8 there. He drops a Trooper Davin Felth at the Bunker, a Blizzard 2 at the Docking bay, a Forest Clearing with an Ozzel, and a Vengeance and Black Squadron TIE at Endor in the next 2 turns. I get Dagobah, signal for The PLanet that its... and deploy it targetting Endor. On my third turn, I dropped Artoo in the Spiral, deployed SFoils, and inserted. He drops another TIE and draws. I drop 6 XWings, battle, Organized Attack, draw a 5 for destiny. He loses everything at the location and two more, and the insert comes up. He loses 13. He Twileks for secret tech: Search and Destroy. He deploys it, and I lose a ton of force. We trade drains, but Search and Destroy was the difference.<br/>
Full Loss by 12<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Drew Lichtenstein<br/>
My LS v. his DS Abyssins<br/>
I start Yarna, he starts JP and Well Guarded.<br/>
He gets Audience Chamber from deck, drops, Mos Eisley, and draws. I get C7 from deck, deploy Bothawui and SFoils from hand, and refill my hand to 12. He gets Entrance Cavern and Jabba (SE) from reserve deck. He deploys Scum and Villainy and Myo and draws one. I drop Kirdo III from reserve, drop a YT1300 with Figrin and Artoo, and another one with Wioslea. I move them both to C7. He drains, drops Gailid and some Abyssins from hand to assorted JP sites. I drop Tibrin from deck, Kiffex from hand, deploy Rebel Fleet (so strong). I draw up to 12. He drains and draws. On his turn, I signal for the insert. On my activate phase, I signal for Battle Plan. I wager and win. I deploy Coruscant from deck, Rebel Fleet and Battle Plan from hand, and flip my objective. He pays to drain, but the insert came up a total of three times, making him lose 9 each time.<br/>
Full win by 28.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Phillip 'King of EBO' Gladney<br/>
My DS v. his LS HB KesselRun with YT1300s (shocking it isn't EBO)<br/>
I start Oppressive Enforcement. He gives me Mon Mothma (WTF???) and starts with Yarna.<br/>
I drop Audience Chamber and Jabba the Hutt on turn 1, and alter his Yarna. He activates, drops a YT and draws. I drop a Drazin, and SD for my Twilek. I Twilek for Security Precautions. He All Wings for a starfighter, I catch. He gets another system from reserve (1st turn Chandrila, 2nd turn Ralltir). He drops a Freighter Captain and a YT1300 to Ralltir and draws. I monnok him for 3 Kessel Runs, 2 Freighter Captains, and 3 YT1300s. I scan, drain, and get my Delivery from deck. I get my Monnok and Delivery from Lost Pile. He drains, I lose Reactor Terminal from top (who needs Dark Path?). I drain for one, drop Delivery, monnok for 2 Hyper Escapes, and complete Delivery for Monnok, SD, and Reactor Terminal. I draw a few. He drains again, and drops another Freighter Captain and YT1300 at Kessel. I scan yet another EPP from his hand. I see a Noble Sac, so I don't play Zuckuss from hand to drain as planned. I instead drop M'iiyoom for the character-kill. I Monnok for nothing, but see that he has a Kessel Run. I SD for my lost pile. He flips during my draw phase. He drains, I lose 4. He drops Kessel Run, I alter. I drop a Probe machine (Death Squadron Star Destroyer) and stuff it with Vader and Tarkin. I run around probing freely. I eventually drop Battle Order, making him pay precious force to drain. I drop Broken Concentration, and I battle his massive fleet of XWings. I lose Vader and Tarkin, but I have a Ghhhk just in case. He has 3 force left after my drains and monnoks whittled him down. I kept him from drawing up with Broken Concentration, and I dumped a lot of crap from my lost pile to my reserve deck.<br/>
Full win by 41.<br/>
<br/>
Overall: 6(+blah)<br/>
I am still in the slump, and this had better end soon... thanks to all for reading.<br/>
