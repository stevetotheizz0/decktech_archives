<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is my first tourney report, so be kind.  <br/>
<br/>
Or rip me apart, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon I decided I had played my Rebel Scout Team deck enough (Working Stiffs, go read it), so I threw together some nearly random pile of cards.  Hidden Base start, use Aquaris for some activation, then pull Tatooine and docking bays for Tat Celebration.  There’s my first mistake of the day.  Shoulda stuck with what worked.<br/>
Dark side I used "Vader’s Clique."  Hunt Down with dueling and just a few characters.<br/>
<br/>
I played in a WWF battle royale before the tourney started.  Jericho rules.  And a pickup game to play my LS for the first time.  It lost.<br/>
<br/>
There are 7 people to start with, and Garrett (Deadbody) got the bye, but Donnovan showed up just as everyone started.  No one knows how to use the computer, so Garrett ran it all with make-shift command cards.  Now we’ve got 8, but there’s no way this will ever count for anything.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  Vader’s Clique vs. Rob Jeffery’s TIGIH<br/>
<br/>
Well, there goes one way of causing big damage.  Second turn I put down Vader at Endor DB.  Luke joined him for some quality time with daddy, and Obi-Wan sat at the Home 1 DB like a little wussy.  He canceled Visage with a spy and some chump early on.  I had Circle and Focused Attack in my opening hand, so even though I didn’t really know what my destinies would be, I wanted to duel Obi.  I tried to move to him, but Rob points out that I can’t.  Coward.  I move my EPPVader to the CC DB instead.  His turn he drops Gen Lando and plays Rebel Leadership to add a destiny.  I either forgot to swing at Lando (!) or missed, I don’t remember.  I didn’t want Vader to die until I got another in hand, so I YAB Lando to end the battle.  Next turn I deploy U3PO with Obi and picked up.  Got Mara, Vader, saber, and Tarkin by now.  His turn he deploys a bunch of Eloms and uses RL to gang probe Vader.  No worries.  Evader.  Ghhhk.  No harm done.  My turn I can’t remember if UC droid spies let me deploy.  Rob says no, and with Mara it doesn’t really matter, so I don’t push it.  I check my reserve deck and see just a couple 1’s and a bunch of 4’s &amp; 6’s.  Mara &amp; Vader+saber visit Home 1’s DB.  Circle, Focused.  Ben’s got a saber, but I’m not scared.  He draws two 4’s.  My first one is a 1.  %^$&amp;!  Then 5, 6.  Yay!  His turn he drains me at the Holotheatre yet again.  I can’t find CHYBC for anything.  Then 3 at the CCDB from freed Luke/saber/prof.  Two turns later Tarkin grabs Luke and joins Vader at the other CCDB.  Mara and Empy are chillin at the D*DB.  I get out Coward right around this time.  He puts out the Downtown Plaza with some guy.  Sim Aloo slaps him up and lives.  Vader, Tarkin, Mara block his only drain.  A couple battles later the game is over.<br/>
<br/>
FW +9 or 11<br/>
<br/>
Good:  Dueling is fun.  I have yet to lose a duel with this deck.<br/>
Bad:  Couldn’t find CHYBC for the longest time.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  My pile of random LS cards shot out of my @$$ vs. Garrett "Deadbody" Larson’s BHBM w/Imp Commands<br/>
<br/>
Garrett and I have know each other forever.  I am at his house at least once a week to play cards or N64, so I’m not thrilled to play him.  Then again, it’s been quite a while since we played each other in a tourney.<br/>
<br/>
He does usual BHBM stuff first turn, but unlike most, he uses Emp’s Power cuz his destinies suck hardcore.  My turn I look for Aquaris.  Not there, so I take Tatooine, and a docking bay.  I deploy Master Wedge at RVpoint and move him to Tat.  His second turn he puts out Zuckuss in ship and 4lom as a passenger.  WTF?!  Second turn?  Wedge and his ship die, and I’m pretty much screwed.  A turn or two later I get MiniFalcon with Farmboy as a guest pilot, put out I’m on the Leader.  I get Ben and some chumps on the ground and set up Celebration.  I don’t remember exactly what happened around this time, but I do remember Garrett putting Piett on the ship (pilot character).  I get Tycho in Red 5 with a x-wing cannon at Tat., and Garrett runs to Rendili like a scared wimp.  He puts Lord Vader at Hoth DB.   I don’t want to lose to the effect, so I have to land the falcon, hop luke out and transit him over to Vader.  That leaves just tycho at the system.  He had picked up Bossk in bus with Janus, and deploys it, lat damage, and first strike.  Damn.  I didn’t save, and I had A Few Manuvers and Darklighter spin.  I lose another battle (and he forgets to make me stack one).  That’s all my ships.  I move the Falcon back up, but Lando/Nunb can’t stop Zuckuss, so I’m done.  He puts out No Escape, and deploys a very cheap Bizzard 1 and Veers to the generic DB where Ben is stationed.  Imp Command, Emp’s Power, and Ben dies.  Garrett mops up any unsightly Rebels left and wins.<br/>
<br/>
FL -20 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Good:  ...<br/>
Bad:  Light side sucks, and this deck more than the average LS.  I pretty much gave up and paid more attention to my pizza than the game after the first couple battles.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  My pile vs. Graham "Mr. Cheese" Neal’s MKOS (Myo)<br/>
<br/>
Graham really loves S&amp;V.  He also likes No Bargin and None Shall Pass.  He set up and flipped using the 3 Jabba’s Palace battlegrounds.  He was spread pretty thin, but every attempt of mine to beatdown was foiled by NSP.  I had pretty much every EPP plus Ben in my hand too.  I put out Battle Order early, so he was slowly draining me.  After a while I just gave up trying to infiltrate the palace, and I set up Celebration at the other end of the planet.  Not for long though.  MiniFalcon kicks butt until Zuckuss the @ss pirate shows up.  A lot of battles happen, and I am able to Fallen Portal most of them, but I don’t think Graham really cares since S&amp;V gets everything back.  This game was decided a long time ago, so at this point I’m looking for moral victories.  I draw and find my Tat:JP.  His turn he gets back most of his lost pile.  I activate all and convert his unoccupied Jabba’s Palace to make him lose 1.  I smile and say "Wassup now, biotch?", then draw up so he can’t retrieve anymore.<br/>
<br/>
FL -20something<br/>
<br/>
Good: squishing guys, and my moral victory<br/>
Bad:  Zuckuss is evil<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  Vader’s Clique vs. Garrett’s Quiet Mining Colony (!?!)<br/>
<br/>
I had talked with Garrett the other day about how the new AO for LS could help this deck, but for some reason he played QMC today instead of waiting a week.  Fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
First turn I get out Rendili, but there’s no D*DB.  The cloud city one’s in my hand, but I don’t want to make it easier for him to flip.  I draw up Vader.  His turn he gets 2 or 3 CC sites down.  He puts down a spy and a chump to cancel Visage.  I put Sir Chokes-a-lot with saber at my CCDB.  He puts out Launching the assault and Home 1 with Hasshin at Bespin.  I get out U3PO to the holotheatre and Bossk in bus and Zuckuss in ship to Bespin, figuring that with all the 6’s in my deck, busting up Home1 shouldn’t be that tough.  I draw a total of about 4.  &lt;jacking motion&gt;  His turn he deploys a buttload of pilots to the ship and battles.  I lose Zuckuss and that’s it.  Once again I fail to break the immunity.  He moves away from U3PO cuz I forgot to leave one.  Darn.  My turn I put CHYBC and No Escape down to make Zuckuss born again.  Mara co-pilots.  Again, bad destinies for me.  Sometime over the next couple turns, I get Sim Aloo at one site, Tarkin and Janus at the next.  Garrett tried some crap, but my guys beat his down.  Meanwhile in space, he’s eliminated everyone on my side.  He deploys Bron burs at one empty site, Pooky at another, and a bespin defense fighter at Cloud City, then flips.  "Hell no!" I tell him.  "Read your own card."  He thought Bespin was the only thing I had to control to prevent it from flipping.  I think right about then he said, "Ok, this sucks."  Well, duh!  He takes back Pooky and puts Bron in front of one of my guys.  Sim makes sure none of my guys get hurt, and Bron dies.  My turn I put Fett in Slave1 to eliminate the headhunter.  I draw a six and he loses a bunch.  Now he’s feeling how I did for most of the last 2 games.  He puts down Han w/gun in front of Sim, then says, "oh, what the heck," and puts him in front of Vader instead, then shuttles Biggs and Hobbie to join him.  My turn I activate a few, and take a good look at my hand and start laughing uncontrolably.  It’s been obvious for a couple turns that I won, but I decide to have some fun.  I check my destinies: 4, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6.  I am still laughing maniacally.  Use Sim to make sure he doesn’t have a 6 on top.  Battle.  I have you now.  Han misses.  Choke Han.  Dead.  YAB Hobbie.  Chop Biggs.  Battle destiny 6.  I think I forgot to draw the second because I was laughing too hard.  It didn’t matter, that ended the game.<br/>
<br/>
FW +21 or so<br/>
<br/>
Good: Beating the pus out of Garrett after he leveled me the first game.  That last battle was especially enjoyable.<br/>
Bad: Couldn’t take down the big mon cal.  And no dueling.  He lost Luke off the top, and I never saw Obi.  Even if he had them, Garrett’s lost to this deck enough times to know not to deploy the Jedi.<br/>
<br/>
Garrett and I finished quickly.  We both felt like flushing our Light decks, so we played a match of Dark vs. Dark.  Mara took on Mara at the Holotheatre, and they both died.  It was fun.  Garrett wished he had a Weapon Lev in his deck so he could deploy Vader to my Vader, battle, steal my stick, and use it on me.  In the end, Hunt Down beat Bring Him Before Me. <br/>
<br/>
Josh Grace won, with Jim Li getting second.  Almost everyone else went 2-2, but I had bad differential and got 7th out of 8.  Garrett got 5th I think.<br/>
<br/>
Josh and me taught Jim how to play X-files after the tourney, but the store closed after the first couple turns.<br/>
<br/>
Props: Josh for winning<br/>
Vader’s Clique for going undefeated yet again<br/>
Graham for not bringing overly cheesy decks<br/>
Herb for not being there<br/>
<br/>
Slops: Jim for playing Asteroid Sanctuary Odds<br/>
Light side for sucking so hard<br/>
The guy running the store for closing at 10<br/>
Extremely small tournaments.  If I wanted to play Garrett twice, I’d go to his house.<br/>
<br/>
This Saturday at Mirkwood, Chris Perman is running his last regular tournament as a squadron member.  It should be a doozy.  I better get my Reflections 2 shipment before then, or there’ll be hell to pay.  Stay tuned for my and probably 4 other reports about it. </font></td>
