<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is my first tourney report so I’m not really sure about getting everything right so please take that into consideration. Anyway, this is my first tourney in about 2-3 months, and I am hoping to win 3 games. My decks are Profit Podracing/Dueling, and BHBM Move Manipulator. I arrive at Foundation’s Edge 30 min. before the tourney, so I have time to get some new sleeves and resleeve my light deck, and trade.<br/>
<br/>
First Game: my BHBM vs. Martin Warlick’s (major scrub) Profit<br/>
<br/>
First turn I deploy Mara and her stick to the AC. He deploys Scout Luke from deck and can’t battle. I activate a lot, deploy Iggy and Fett w/Rifle to AC, and battle. I draw 4,1 and 4 for destinies and win by a whole bunch. He loses luke and about 5 more. Next turn he just acitvates and draws up. I deploy Palpy and Janus to JP, and deploy Tat DB. I start draining him with Vader, Mara and Palpy/Janus until he deploys Dodo Bonadweeiudo to battle Mara. I finally figure out its a dark side character after the battle and he loses 5 force. He deploys nothing the whole game and I drain him out for the win.<br/>
FW 2 (+37)<br/>
<br/>
Props: Winning by 37<br/>
Slops: Newbiebashing, and not realizing Dodo was a dark side character<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: My Light Profit Racing/Dueling vs. Joey Martin’s BHBM<br/>
<br/>
First turn I deploy Ben to the chamber w/ his stick and unfreeze Han. He deploy The Emporer to Throne room w/Palpy’s Power. I deploy Luke and Orri and Threepio to the palace. He comes down w/ major hit crew (Vader, Tarkin, Iggy w/Gun, and Dr. E and Ponda B.) and captures Luke w/ Vader and kills me by 12, and I forfeit both guys and lose 5 more. He moves the hit squad to the chamber to my Ben and Han. I am thinking crap I’m gonna lose, but then I deploy Lando w/Ax, and Shmi, and battle. I battle, exclude Iggy w/Lando, and shoot Tarkin w/Han. Tarkin cancels the destiny, and I use Smoke Screen to add a six for destiny, and draw a 4 for my other. I beat him badly and he forfeits Tarkin and somebody else, and he moves away. I win the podrace and retrieve, then deploy I Did It! and retrieve somemore. Then I drain, follow him and he deploys Guri and moves again. I drain then follow, and he deploys Bane and Jodo and battle. I play A Jedi’s focus to make his aliens power -1, and he mindscans Lando. I then exclude Bane, and draw my two <br/>
destinies but Jodo cancels one, so I still win the battle. Then on my turn, I still have the same 4 guys there from two turns ago, I battle and kick his butt majorly, and then drain him out and win. <br/>
FW 4(+67)<br/>
Props: Winning by thirty, and proving my light can stand up to a big battling deck. <br/>
Slops: Nothing really. <br/>
<br/>
Game three: My dark vs. Jim Atooie-Kachooie’s Moisture Farmer/Harvest deck<br/>
I start His Name is Anakin instead of Ni Chuba Na along with Mob Points and IAO. He starts Lars farm and Podracing stuff, and I deploy Teemto Pagalies Pod. First turn I deploy Cantina from hand and Tat Docking Bay from deck and lars farm from deck. I deploy Palpy and Tarkin to the Cantina. On his turn he just activates and draws up, and does this for about 5 turns so I won’t go into detail about his turns. I deploy Maul to the cantina and draw some. I get a Mara and deploy her to the Cantina and move Maul and Tarkin to the DB to drain. He demotes Tarkin and I’m thinking he’ll attack so I get Force Lightning into hand. Now he deploys the Outskirts and Qui-Gon there with his stick. I deploy the Hoth War Room and Responsibility of Command targeting Qui-Gon. I drain for a couple turns and win the podrace. He moves Qui to the DB and he get beat up. He then deploys Leia w/Gun, Lando w/Ax and Tat Threepio to the Jundland wastes to drain. I deploy another Responsibility of Command (since the one on Qui was lost cuz he was) targeting Lando and now hes really pissed and thinks he will lose. I keep draining him of 3 a turn, and he deploys Ben and Crell to the Arena and Vaporators to the Wastes and Arena to drain of like 7 a turn. He plays a @#$%load of Harvests, retrieves and barely wins. <br/>
FL 4 (+58)<br/>
Props: Almost beating the eventual tourney winner.<br/>
Slops: Losing (duh) and almost winning.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth and Final Game (this game is for the tourney): My Profit vs. Jim’s You May Start Your Landing Deck. I’ve seen this deck beat Edwin up so I’m scared. I deploy a bunch of guys to the chamber and unfreeze Han. He starts draining and direct damaging me on Hoth. I am draining a bunch and retrieving by winning the podrace and deploy I Did It!. He drains for 14 twice w/walker garrison, and I am draining for 6 a turn. He finally beats me by 4.<br/>
FL 4 (+54)<br/>
Props: Almost winning the tourney (one more turn and I would have won the game and the tourney)<br/>
Slops: Losing by only 4 when almost won!<br/>
