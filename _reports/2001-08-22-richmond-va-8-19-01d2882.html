DS Deck: Post Coruscant Court Racer<br/>
LS Deck: WYS Legendary Starfighter Non racing racer.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t get to participate in Star Wars tournaments very often due to my exhausting work schedule.  But then, the unexpected happens.  I break my foot (that sucks), which opens up my schedule for Star Wars (that’s good).  Coruscant has just come out, so I’m struggling with decks.  I like my Court Racer (undefeated at Atlanta DPC), but I’m also thinking about Black Sun (starting the new Coruscant).  I go with what has been working and play Court.  The LS isn’t quite so easy.  I like WYS, but I’m not convinced that it can survive against the Senate.  I like Hidden Base, but it gives away too much force.  I like a Hyperdrive deck, but I don’t have the Royal Starship.  What to do?  Well, WYS is what I know, so I build a WYS Legendary Starfighter Non-racing racer . . . got that<br/>
<br/>
Sunday Morning, my alarm goes off at 7:00 . . . I get out of bed at 8:45.  I shower, get dressed, and hobble out the door at around 9:15.  The long drive lands me at the store at 10:45.  I buy some packs in the hopes of getting P-59, Amidala, Royal Starship, or Maul (P-59 in particular, because he’ll go in my Court Deck), because  I didn’t have a single one of them.  I get P-60 and promptly trade for P-59.  Mission accomplished.  He takes his spot in my Court deck, and I’m ready to play.  <br/>
<br/>
Round 1: My WYS vs. Tim (The TD) Davis’s Anti-WYS Court.<br/>
<br/>
Tim Davis had looked on Decktech and found a deck that OWNZ WYS.  So, he decided to build it.  I, on the other hand, am playing WYS.  Hooray for match-ups!  But, rather than give him an auto-win, I decide to actually play the game and see what happesn..  I start HFTMF, Insurrection &amp; Aim High, BP &amp; DTF, and Squadass.  He has a pretty standard Court start.<br/>
<br/>
First turn, Tim deploys Ephant Mon and Mighty Jabba to the Chamber and converts Tatooine.  That sucked, because in my hand, I drew both Jedi Luke and his saber.  For a grand total of 8 force, I could have dropped into the chamber, sliced Jabba, and killed Ephant Mon with Attrition.  That would have been game but with only 7 force I instead deploy Kessel and the H1:DB and lose 1 off the top to Court.  I draw finding Melas, the Outrider, and a Dodge.  He drains me for 1--EPP Han off the top.  He searches for Boelo, who is hiding in his force pile, and I verify.  Yes, this is, in fact, a pile of WYS hate.  I reveal the Outrider to grab Dash and I deploy them to the SP:DB.  Melas has apparently been spending too much time in the Cantina, because he’s too drunk to fight.  Instead, he hides in my hand and sends Mirax to the Tatooine DB to avoid Court damage.  She transits over to Kessel, where she boards the Outrider, and they take off.  I knew he was going to deploy Zukuss (and since I had Melas in hand, that made this an incredibly stupid move), and I should have also counted on him deploying a starship from hand, but I didn’t.  Well, he drains me, deploys Scum &amp; Villainy, deploys ZiMH from reserve and IG-2000 from hand.  He initiates, retrieves, and I come to realize how stupid I had just been.  His 2 destinies are low, a 1 and a 4, and Mirax covers all of it.  My destiny gets reduced to 0, so he loses nobody.  Melas stumbles out of my hand and onto the table.  Anyway, I deploy Luke with his saber to the H1:DB, land the Outrider, transit Dash and Luke to the Tatooine DB.  As Dash and Luke try to sober Melas up, I draw a few cards and find the Falcon, All Wings &amp; Darklighter Spin, and Tunnel Vision.  He drains for 2, deploys Boelo into the AC, and deploys Gailid.  I Tunnel Vision, which gets grabbed, to make sure that my other Han isn’t in my force pile.  He isn’t, so I pull Legendary Starfighter instead.  Han and the Falcon deploy to the SP:DB and await back-up.  Melas is so trashed that when Dash yells at him for not helping in the earlier bounty hunter battle, Melas hears "Help me fly the Outrider in a bounty hunter battle", so he and Dash go join Han to fight the bounty hunter ships.  Luke stays behind to drain.  Well, Tim drains for 1, and right around the end of his deploy phase, a lightbulp pops on over Luke’s head.  "Wait, guys!  Our Objective isn’t flipped.  You’re only going to get 1 destiny.  Take me instead.  You’ll get 3."  Sorry, Luke!  It’s too late.  He initiates and draws two destiny--a 4 and a 5.  I reduce power and Han Darklighter Spins.  It’s an impressive maneuver that takes down IG-2000 with 4 attriition, and from that day forward, all throughout the galaxy, parents tell their children about the great Han Solo, smuggler extraordinaire, and his Legendary Starfighter--The Falcon.  Well, Han’s risky maneuver, spectacular though it might have been, cost him his life due to the DS’s 9 attrition.  Melas also dies . . . but it’s of alcohol poisoning.  The Falcon floats silently in space, where it remains a legend to this day.  After the battle, Tim loses 2 force.  Luke drains for 2 at the DB.  Murr Denod is a good friend of Melas, so he goes to the Cantina to settle Melas’s bar tab . . . since Melas is dead.  Luke hires transport to Kessel, where the Outrider has landed to give him a ride.  Tim drains me at Kessel and the AC.  He deploys Xizor and P-60 (why he’s playing P-60 and not P-59, I don’t know.) to the Cantina.  I guess Melas owed them money too, because they decide to take it out of Murr Denod’s hide. Well, Murr Denod isn’t the lush that Melas was though, and he’s sober enough to Dodge.  Boelo moves to the Dungeon, and Tim loses 2 to the Falcon.  I pay to drain for 2 at the Kessel DB.   Murr Denod walks back in the Cantina to see if Xizor is still there.  The Outrider takes off with it’s new co-pilot to hopefully scare Zuckuss away.  Well, Tim has been doing some tracking, so after drains, and after Bossk drives his bus to Tatooine with the Punishing One, Zuckuss initiates a battle.  I reduce power and draw a 5.  Tim’s battle destiny is a tracked 5 which is enough to kill Luke.  Well, I don’t realize at the moment how much this sucks, because I now have 2 On The Edges in my hand, and the only viable targets for it are in my lost pile.  Meanwhile, every time Tim initiates a battle, he retrieves with Scum &amp; Villainy, and that’s effectively negating the damage of Legendary Starfighter.  Speaking of which, Xizor battles Murr Denod again.  I dodge again.  He loses 2 in his move phase and draws a few.  Well, I drain for 3 because at some point earlier, he had converted Kessel.  Murr Denod decides to pay Xizor one more visit, only this time he’s bringing friends--Chewie and Yotts Orren.  Talon Karrde deploys to the Tatooine DB, where Dash lands and transits to join him.  Xizor has nowhere to run to.  Tim drains for 4.  I lose both of my now worthless On The Edges and my last 2 Controls (which is effectively like losing no force at all, since they’ve been grabbed.  You see, I can stack them . . . or I can lose them, then stack them.).  In Tim’s control phase, Chewie cancels P-60’s game text since he, unlike P-59, has power &lt;4.  Well, Tim decides he can run outside, get drained for 2 in the Cantina and get jumped at the DB, or he can battle and hope attrition doesn’t clear his forces.  He stays and battles.  I draw 2 destinies--a 1 and a 6.  He draws a 5.  Well, he has to lose both characters.  I lose only Yotts Orren.  In his move phase, he loses 2.  Despite his decision, I get to drain in the Cantina after all, but since I’ve only got about 5 force left (plus 3 or 4 in my hand), I can only pay to drain for 2 since I have to pay to stack my Controls.  Dash and Karrde transit back to Kessel where they board the Outrider and take off to satisfy Battle Plan.  He drains for 1, 2, and 1.  I pay to stack the Control, thus cancelling the 2, and then lose two cards from hand.  He loses 2.  I drain for 2 and 2.  I move the Outrider to Tatooine to block his drain.  He drains for 2 (which gets cancelled by my last Control) and 1.  He battles and retrieves.  He has no actions.  I reduce Bossk’s power and draw a 5 and a 6 for battle destiny.  He draws a 5.  He loses both ships, while I lose only Talon Karrde.  My drains and Falcon Damage get him down to 2 force, so his last set of drains is canceled by Battle Plan.  I win by 3 with less than a minute left in the round.  Whew!<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 (+3)<br/>
<br/>
Props:  To Tim for bringing this one down to the wire.  What an incredible game!  To the Falcon for being so Legendary that the DS just can’t stand it.  To Battle Plan for winning me this game.<br/>
Slops:  To the Betty Ford clinic for releasing Melas from treatment.  What the hell were they thinking?<br/>
<br/>
Well out of the 12 people that are here, only 2 LS decks won.  That pairs me up against the SECOND highest DS deck.  (Apparently a win by 3 isn’t exactly a crushing victory.  Who knew?)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My Court Racer vs. Ben Wachter’s Hyperdrive Racer.<br/>
<br/>
Ben starts Seeking An Audience.  I choose not to start the Box, opting for Allegations of Corruption instead.  I strategically place the Podrace Arena between the City Outskirts and Watto’s Junkyard.  It will take Qui-Gon an extra turn to get to the Junkyard.<br/>
<br/>
Well, my opening hand is a little weak as the only character I get is EPP Vader.  In my activate phase, Sebulba sabotages Anakin, but my first draw is one of my two DBs.  I lecture my deck about crappy draws and give it an evil stare.  Of course, I don’t stack the 0 as that would take away one of my force icons and allow my opponent to "draw 3 choose 2" next turn.  We start the race on even footing.  I deploy my other DB from reserve and lose 1 to my objective and draw a few.  He deploys Amidala and Naked 3PO to the Junkyard.  He plays Mindful of the Future and deploys the Marketplace.  The race continues.  He stacks a 4 and 1 on his racer.  I stack a 2.  I deploy EPP Vader to the Junkyard, battle, slice Amidala, and draw 5 for destiny.  He draws low.  The site is completely cleared.  He deploys Tawss Khaa to the Junkyard.  I play No Escape to retrieve EPP Vader into hand.  I deploy him and 4-LOM to the Junkyard, battle, cancel text, and slice him.  My battle destiny is a 1, so he only has to lose 6 overflow.  I again lose EPP Vader, and 4-LOM goes into power save mode.  I draw a few and leave 1 to grab ASB.  Well, apparently those were the best characters Ben could muster at the time, as he can only deploy Horox Rhyder to circumvent the Court damage.  Horox decides to spend the day at the races, but because his horse is losing the race, Horox loses 1 force to his game text.  (So, he lost 1 to Horox instead of Court . . . right!)  He plays A Step Backward to place my 2 and his 1 back in the used pile rather than have Anakin get sabotaged again.  Well, I grab ASB with Allegations.  We won’t have any more of that.  Palpatine decides he wants to be a traveling droid salesman, so he goes to the junkyard to try and sell 4-LOM.  I draw a few, Accelerate Our Plans, and pull a Podracer Collision.  Qui-Gon considers buying 4-LOM, but he’s a wise old man, and decides he’d better shop around first, so he goes to the Marketplace.  Horox’s horse pulls ahead, so he begins to retrieve.  Of course, just as Horox thinks he’s sitting pretty, Sebulba collides with Anakin as he goes by.  I drain for 1, deploy Mara and her saber to the Junkyard as some extra back up for 4-LOM and Palpy.  He drains for 1, retrieves 1 with the Marketplace, deploys Obi-Wan and his saber to the Outskirts, and retrieves 1 because Anakin pulled ahead again.  At this point, I’m sweating because the race is so close.  I Collision his racer and remove a 5.  On the next set of destiny draws, we tie at 20.  I deploy P-59 to the Junkyard, Dr. E to the Marketplace, and Mara goes shopping in the Marketplace for a new purse.  I accelerate our plans and find a Podracer Collision just in case he Steps Backwards to keep his race hopes alive.  Ric Olie is tired of waiting, so he goes to the Junkyard to look for the Hyperdrive himself.  Captain Madakor wants a new set of earrings so she joins Qui-Gon at the Marketplace.  Horox can’t stand to watch the end of the race, so he goes to the Junkyard.  Sure enough, Sebulba flashes Ani as he passes him to cross the finish line.  Whew!  I play Start Your Engines (knowing I would retrieve it) and set a 6 for Weapon Destiny.  Palpatine waits to see what happens one block over.  Mara calls Madakor a fat cow, Qui-Gon has to defend her honor.  Mara swings her saber but Qui-Gon deflects it.  After the smoke clears, Madakor had died of embarrassment, and Xizor had died laughing.  Palpatine zaps Ric Olie as a prank, but he didn’t think it was funny.  Obi-Wan runs over.  4-LOM cancels Obi’s game text.  Obi swings at Palpatine, but the old man is just crafty enough that a 4 and 3 can’t touch him.  P-59 shoots Ric Olie, and Ben has to lose 2.  Attrition kills Ric Olie, Horox, and 4-LOM.  Meanwhile, I draw and find my other 4-LOM.  Obi decides he doesn’t want to brave fighting Palpatine again, so he goes to find his master.  Mara’s been waiting for him because her lightsaber doubles as a rifle.  She snipers Obi with it.  Palpatine drains.  4-LOM finds his way back from the scrap heap and goes to the Marketplace.  With only Qui-Gon there, I initiate a battle.  4-LOM cancels his game text.  Mara swings but misses.  Qui-Gon dies but he proves that 4-LOM is not built Ford tough as he takes 4-LOM with him.  Ben draws looking for something, but he can’t find anything.  I force drain and retrieve (since I now control the Marketplace).  Rather than let me retrieve any more, Ben draws up while I have a hand full of cards, making my victory a win by only 20.  He never stacked a single card on Credits Will Do Fine.<br/>
<br/>
FW 4 (+23)<br/>
<br/>
Props:  To Vader’s early cameos winning me the game.  To Sebulba racing like a champ.  To Credits Will Do Fine for sitting there looking pretty.<br/>
Slops:  To Credits Will Do Fine for sitting there looking pretty.<br/>
<br/>
Ben was ultra cool and I would gladly play him again, but after his deck got handled, I don’t think that he felt the same way . . . at least not in this tournament.  Of course, Ben doesn’t realize how close he was to winning.  If he had managed to win that race, it would have been an entirely different game.  Anyway, a +23 differential puts me in second place behind Curtis Brown.  That’s a blessing in disguise because it means that I’m going to play DS.<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: My DS vs. Curtis Brown’s MWYHL Test to 6 Racer.<br/>
<br/>
What an interesting deck!  His one starting effect is Battle Plan.  Of course, I’m wondering at this point if he is just using MWYHL as a generation platform, but as I would soon find out, he was really testing, and that made things interesting.  Anyway, I start Allegations again trying to catch ASB.  Little did I know, he wasn’t playing them.<br/>
<br/>
I get no Dark Jedi in my opening hand.  Curtis plays Entering the Arena and starts the race before my control phase ever begins.  I sabotage Anakin and draw a 1 for my first race destiny.  I am forced to remind my deck about the importance of race destinies with another admonishing scowl.  That 1 does not get stacked.  With no Dark Jedi, I choose not to deploy and lose Elis Helrot to Court (it wasn’t going to do me any good this game anyway) and draw a few.  The first card I draw is one of my DBs, and I kick myself for forgetting to deploy them.  In the others, I find Palpatine, 4-LOM, and the second DB.  So, forgetting didn’t hurt me.  Curtis searches for a Dagobah site, deploys Yoda, and grabs I Did It.  He loses to Court.  We draw race destinies again, and I begin to see what his deck is--a pile of the highest destinies he could amass.  Luckily his first two were ONLY two 5s.  I draw a 4.  I neglect to drain, since I need my force to deploy Mara, her saber, and Dr. E to the AC.  I search for a Force Lightning and find that there is no saber, so the stick will have to wait.  He deploys Luke, a Dagobah Site, Test 1, and loses 1 to Court.  During his draw phase, I Podracer Collision.  Thus, he’s behind in the race, but still only gets two destiny draws.  My draw is a 4.  He draws a 5 and a 4.  That’s a total of 14 for both podracers . . . heh heh.  The AC crew drains, and then Mara pulls her saber.  I draw a few where I find Sniper, No Escape, and Xizor.  I also find Accelerate Our Plans, but I use that immediately to go grab . . . get this . . . Accelerate Our Plans.  All of my other racing interrupts were in my force pile.  After he activates 1 force, I go grab Start Your Engines with the WMAOP I just pulled.  He finishes test 1, deploys Corran Horn to the Podracer Bay, deploys TK-422 to the AC, deploys Hiding In The Garbage, deploys test 2, and then asks me if I would like to move test 2.  I move the test to Luke, because testing takes 1 turn longer that way, and prepare for my turn.  I activate, sabotage Anakin for the second time, and draw a 1 (which I do stack).  Palpatine can smell a spy a mile away and zaps TK-422’s helmet off.  Mara, with a wicked grin, switches her lightsaber to rifle mode and snipers him.  Despite the undercover spy’s intrusion, I drain.  I draw a few and find Maul Strikes, WMAOP, and Young Fool.  I Accelerate Our Plans for Podracer Collision and Maul Strikes for Maul’s saber.  He deploys Boushh undercover to the AC, deploys The Way of Things, and completes Test 2, he deploys test 3, moves over, and immediately completes it.  Boussh gets sneaky and sabotages (the interrupt) Mara’s sniper-saber.  Palpatine smells a spy again, but this one is a little bit more elusive.  He takes a chance that he knows who it is and zaps at Boushh.  A blind 5 makes her lost, and Young Fool places her out of play.  I drain.  Curtis and I stack race destinies.  Anakin is winning 25 to 24.  I Collision and remove a 6.  24 to 19.  Guri, Xizor, and Maul (with his saber) jump Corran Horn.  Maul swings, but Corran Horn deflects it.  Entering the Arena adds a battle destiny.  He draws a 7 and 6.  I draw a 5.  Test 3 subtracts 1 and Yoda reduces attrition but he still has a lot of overflow.  So, he loses Corran and cards.  I lose Maul, Guri, and Xizor.  Curtis deploys Test 4, and then has to lose 1 to Court again.  I activate to the 5 I drew for battle destiny to ensure that Sebulba wins the race.  Curtis, however, draws a 7 and a 6.  We’re tied at 32.  I drain and draw.  Curtis finishes Test 4, deploys Qui-Gon to the Podrace Arena, deploys Test 5, uses Hiding In The Garbage to look for characters, but he finds them too late.  He then switches to finding starships in the garbage, but the only one he finds is Artoo in Red 5, which is the last card in his force pile.  Sebulba sabotages Anakin for the third and final time and draws a 6 to finish the race with a final race total of 41.  I deploy P-59 to the Audience Chamber.  EPP Vader deploys to the Podrace Arena.  4-LOM and Palpatine move to the Podrace Arena to join Vader.  The race resolves.  Curtis activates to 2 cards, uses Test 4 to pull one of the cards, starts Test 5, plays On The Edge to retrieve 6 force, and deploys the Tatooine system.  I grab On The Edge with Allegations.  I drain and draw.  He finishes Test 5 and stacks a 7, but he can’t activate enough to retrieve.  Curtis, looks for a Dagobah site, there isn’t one and then he looks through the garbage for a Starship.  Eventually, he finds the Home One.  I, on the other hand, have just drawn Maul.  I search for a Force Lightning to check my reserve deck, but there is no Force Lightning.  Curtis Changes The Odds and places a WMAOP out of play.  The card I was really looking for isn’t there--The Sith Infiltrator.  So, I drain and draw.  I find a WMAOP and Force Lightning.  Curtis searches for a Dagobah site again, but doesn’t find one.   Curtis deploys Test 6, takes Luke into hand, deploys Luke to Vader’s site, duels and wins.  Luke doesn’t want to stand toe to toe with the Emperor, so he runs indoors to battle Mara.  Palpatine zaps him before he moves.  I drain, grab Force Lighting, grab a Podracer Collision with WMAOP (If he wants to search for a Dagobah Site again, it will cost him), and pull ZiMH.  I drop ZiMH with Maul as a passenger to Tatooine.  I battle Luke and swing with Mara.  Luke deflects.  I grab the Deflection with Hell to Pay.  He gets an automatic 14 destiny.  I draw a 3 destiny.  Luke clears the site, but my forfeit protects me from any further damage.  I drain for 1 and 2.  Luke moves outside.  Palpatine zaps him, I initiate a battle, 4-LOM cancels his game text, Vader swings.  He hits.  The 14 attrition kills Vader and 4-LOM, but Palpatine won’t die.  And that’s basically game.  With no Luke and Battle Plan satisfied, I drain him out for a win of 14.  <br/>
<br/>
FW 6 (+37)<br/>
<br/>
Props: To Sebulba for racing like a champ.  To Luke battling at 20 power . . . by himself!!!<br/>
Slops: To Curtis for forgetting to reduce my race destiny with Test 3 and deploying Tatooine.  Those mistakes cost you the game, my friend.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the end of that game drew a crowd, because nobody knew who would win.  It was a game of point and counter-point.  I can think of only one game in my career that matched this game in tension . . . Game 1 of this tournament.  Well, I make a mental note to add Do They Have A Code Clearance and a Tusken Raider to my Court Racer, and I get ready for the final pairing.  At this point, I’m wondering if my luck has run out.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My WYS vs. Chris McDaniel’s Senators (Darth Maul Site).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, joy!  I was unsure if WYS would be able to hold up against a Senate deck . . . and now I get to find out.  Well, I don’t believe that the Senate is as devastating to WYS as people think it is, so it’s time to find out.  I prepare myself to lose, and I ask him if he’s undefeated so far.  I might still be able to lose this game and win the tournament.  Nope, he’s undefeated also.  I’ve got to win.  And just like in Game 1, rather than give him the auto-win, I decide to play the game.<br/>
<br/>
He starts IAO&amp;SP, Do They Have A Code Clearance, and I Will Find Them Quickly.  Chris plays Squabbling Delegates at the beginning of his activate phase to go get the esteemed Lott Dodd.  He sets up two senators in the Galactic Senate and flips.  He draws and plays Vote Now to draw from Reserve.  I deploy Kessel and the H1: DB.  Without the pressure of Court or Visage damage to make me hurry to deploy, I draw up to 12 cards.  I’m doing fine.  Chris uses one of his senators and loses 1 to make the top card of my deck lost.  He does this about 4 times in the game, and at really random times, when I don’t think it really helped him.  Chris starts to drain me at the Senate, but when those Senators learn they have to pay for it, they form a budget committee and decide that they can’t pay for the drain.  The drain gets vetoed.  He finishes deploying his docking bays (Coruscant, Naboo, and Spaceport at Naboo), so I’m itching to play Phylo Gandish.  He drops Coruscant Maul to the Desert Landing Site, plays Boba Fett in Slave 1 to Tatooine.  I Tunnel Vision to see what’s in my force pile, and pull Dash.  I deploy the SP:DB to Kessel.  I All Wings for the Falcon and reveal Dash to get the Outrider.  Han and Dash prepare their ships to take off to Kessel while they talk about how there just isn’t enough Menace in the Galaxy today.  Yeah, the Menace has been Fading ever since crazy old Melas died.  Speaking of which, Murr Denod never got a chance to settle Melas’s tab in Game 1, so he returns to the Cantina to try and settle up.  Chris drains for 3, but I cancel 2 with a control (Maul also tried to drain, but since the Menace has been Fading, he just didn’t feel evil enough).  Meanwhile, EPP Vader brings two of his cronies to collect on another one of Melas’s debts. Murr assures them that he’s dead, but they won’t hear it.  So, they try to take the debt out of Murr’s hide.  What these sinister types fail to realize is that Murr Denod is jedi-quick, and he dodges.  I drain for 4 (A senator vetoes the Kessel drain), Tunnel Vision from my lost pile, and pull Legendary Starfighter.  I deploy Bacta Tank.  Murr Denod peeks back in the Cantina door to see if EPP Vader is still there.  Chris drains.  I cancel a drain with a Control from the Lost pile.  EPP Vader attacks again, and Murr Denod dodges again (from hand).  I drain for 4 (again the senate vetoes the Kessel drain).  Mirax flies the Pulsar Skate in front of Boba Fett.  She calls for reinforcement, so Dash and Han fly over from Kessel.  Murr Denod steps back into the Cantina.  He likes this game.  Chris drains as Vader calls his boss about this really annoying Ithorian who just won’t let him rest.  His boss gets pissed and decides to take care of the Ithorian by himself.  So, Palpatine waits outside the Cantina with Janus.  Vader initiates a battle.  Murr Denod dodges out of the Cantina, but as he runs out the door, Palpatine zaps him.  Chris, feeling very proud of himself, chuckles menacingly.  Boba Fett, on the other hand, pleads with him, "Umm, Chris, you might want to take a loot at my situation.  I need to get out of . . . Hello, Chris! . . . Chris, are you there?"  Well, when I don’t try to force drain at Kessel, Chris has this look of confusion.  He was expecting to veto it, again.  Then he realizes what he has forgotten.  NOOOOO!  I have no smugglers in my hand, so I can’t flip, and that saves him a lot of force from this battle.  But, Dash still reduces power, and I severely overpower him.  My destiny is low and his is high.  So, after Boba Fett dies Chris only loses 6 overflow.  Mirax breaks a few ribs in the battle, but it’s nothing that a turn in the Bacta Tank won’t cure.  Han and Dash fly back to their summer homes on Kessel, leaving the Tatooinese (what a great word) people to marvel at the Falcon’s Legend.  Chris pays to drain for 2 and 1, and I cancel the 2 with Control.  Chris loses 2 to Legendary Starfighter.  I pay to drain for 3.  Phylo Gandish and Luke arrive at Kessel to congratulate Han and Dash, but Han and Dash won’t land.  Chris pays to drain for 2 (which I again cancel) and 1.  He loses 2, and draws.  Mirax comes out of the tank.  Han is On The Edge, but when a mistracked 6 results in a draw of 1, Han falls into the Bacta Tank.  I stack the On The Edge.  Mirax deploys to the Tatooine DB along with Theron Nett.  Luke draws his Lightsaber, and he and Phylo Gandish transit to the Tatooine DB.  Now, Chris is disheartened, and rather than look for ways to win, he just settles in.  He drains, loses 2, and draws.  I drain, battle, slice Palpatine, and my 2 destinies clear the site.  Chris gives up, and he won’t even pay to drain.  So, Legendary Starfighter and my drains win by 19.<br/>
<br/>
8 (+56)<br/>
<br/>
Props: To Murr Denod for being jedi-quick.  To the Bacta Tank for being a Fountain of life.<br/>
Slops: To Me for mistracking that 6 (Why was I going for differential in the final game?).  To Melas for owing money all over the Outer Rim.<br/>

So, as it turns out, the match-up that I was most worried about ends up being the easiest game of the day.  I end the tournament as the only undefeated.  I get 8 packs of Coruscant for my troubles.  In those packs, I get 2 Phylo Gandishes (the best LS character out of the set, if you ask me), Darth Maul (HOORAY!), Mace Windu, and a few more cards.  I trade a lot and leave the store an Amidala short of a player’s set of Coruscant.  I’m still far from the Collector’s set.  Afterwards, I spend some time helping a new player tweak his decks, because this was his first tournament.  Helping newbies out always makes me happy.  I go home and add the Tusken Raider and Code Clearance to the Court Racer, which just keeps getting better.  Well, I’ve stalled it long enough so here they are.<br/>
