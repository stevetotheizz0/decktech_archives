He flips on tatione and I cancel vasage with the spy. Draing war and then he beats me down with 5 mains at the exuctutor and I lose by 13, that&amp;#8217;s basicly game.<br/>
<br/>
   Fl 0(-24)<br/>

Slops: losing by a lot less if I didn&amp;#8217;t cancel visage.<br/>
<br/>

Game 2: my court against profit<br/>
Not cool, I hate profit, todally screws over my scum but anyway&amp;#8230;<br/>
Set up some guys and get hearded over to mos isly with all his mains. Again a drain war with profit doing damage the whole time. Then I capture his r2 and  2 other guys, bring them to the dungen and retrive 6, donsn&amp;#8217;t help much but hey. Then I hit han but I lose all my guys, he uses ben to retrive him. Then I lose from profit and mains.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: my fans and his huntdown<br/>
Well I basicly do nothing!!! I can&amp;#8217;t drain and hes killing me with  3 scouts and some good interrupts. Io cancel visage but too late, don&amp;#8217;t get to retrive with no mice on table, no fun!<br/>
<br/>
FL 0(-76)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: my court against hidden base<br/>
Well, I know this kids friend and he&amp;#8217;s played about 5 times. So I try to help him when playing. I set up gaild and hutt influence with the 2 guys necisary to drain. Then I help him after he flips by telling him to to spread out early game and to drain then later game bunch up and drain, he was gona bunch up then so I couldn&amp;#8217;t kill him but it was like turn 3. so he does the drains and I get out scum and firct strike, then I play down buba and I attack, I retrive 4 and he loses 2(he had draw there fire) so I;m happy, we both tie and I move. Then I;m draining for 6 each turn and 1 to the objective while I&amp;#8217;m retriving, when I get down to hime with 1 force left I attack and retrive lost pile and he loses the game.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(-15)<br/>
Props: did ok and I played with good statigies.<br/>
Slops: I tried to help but I wasn&amp;#8217;t gona lose on purpose. I felt sorry for him but he didn&amp;#8217;t mind it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: my court against his profit and harvest<br/>
Well, this was another bad game, I basicly am getting screwd over and AGAIN hearded into the couner and deing. I&amp;#8217;m feeling good cause this guys really nice and cool so I ask what his differencial is, he says 32, so I make a deal to lose by 33 giving him +1 for fun. This is a really great guy(sean estes) so it&amp;#8217;s no biggy. So I let hime harvest for 6 or so turns and I draw up.<br/>
<br/>
FL 2(-48)<br/>
<br/>
Props: losing for fun and to a great guy to help his differenal. I was so low ot didn&amp;#8217;t matter.<br/>
Slops: almost none, I need to get a better court idea<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: my fans vs my best friend huntdown, the same I lsot by 7 to<br/>
Well, somehow everytime I&amp;#8217;ve played I get tessek so I set up tesske and draw for a take me to jabba now or a kabe. Then I set up bo shuda and camp the kabe and tessek. Then I canel visage with my bothnain spy and 2 rats for forfit protection(I was thinking about the time I caneled with no protection, smart huh?) so then I set up the drains. He battles and I beat him I do it over and over and make him lose to first strike. Hes got 5 card left and I drain for all but 1 then I retive 6 and I drain. Fun game and It worked.<br/>
<br/>
