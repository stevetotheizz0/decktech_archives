<br/>
There was another 4-game tourney this same morning but I don´t really feel like writing about it. Ithor´s favourite cheater assisted and that sucked. Enough said.<br/>
<br/>
After that Rafa, Peri and me (who attended that tourney) had lunch and headed for our afternoon´s revenge. Two tourneys the same day, eight games in a row. Damn, this is going to be a long long day&amp;#8230;<br/>
<br/>
I decided to change my DS deck because I´m getting tired of Skrillings. I´ll be using my Surgeon TIE bomber quirugical strikes (just posted) for dark and WYS+Palace Riders+Harvest (I´m getting tired of this too) for light.<br/>
<br/>
The tourney starts quite late because and bunch of Pokemon morons thought there was a Pok tourney there and we had to smack them down. So 16 people there, quite good because lots of people were out of town on holidays.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : My WYS vs Ivan Burriel´s ISB<br/>
<br/>
I´m afraid this is going to be a long game because our low draining ratios. He starts IAO, Imperial Decree and Secret Plans, I start as usual Insurrection, Stag Areas and Squad Ass. First turn he pulled Coruscant db and draw. My hand was shi.t so I deployed Home one db and draw carefully being afraid of an early Monnock. His second turn was just for pulling the &lt;&gt; db to Coruscant and draw (saving some). I was like wtf? I didn´t know what to think about his deck after that. I was waiting for a heavy space deck. OK, my second turn,  I deployed Mini Falcon (Han and Melas) and draw. His third turn and he does nothing. So I was crazy at this moment thinking that he will kick my a-s-s in space. He didn´t activate much so if he was preparing a huge beatdown he needed to save force for several turns. My third turn I deployed my green aliens on their crazy cars and the gay droid couple on my two dbays. He twileks in my turn and goes asking the judge for five minutes. That was a pitty because we were late on time and I was pretty sure this would be a timed game. <br/>
<br/>
He returns and gets Sunsdown as effect (not the combo so I was safe at the moment). On his turn he deployed Choke Vader and 6 ISB´s to my &lt;&gt; db. He started battle, my patrol craft reacted and a Fallen Portal smacked two of his guys. I played Artoo I have a bad feeeling so it was three destinies for me and none for Ivan. That was pretty much the game. Half of his guys died but he stayed there. I deployed some more green aliens and battled killing everybody but Ozzel (which should have died due to my reaction, but I forgot,scrub!).<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the game of me draining and celebrating and he trying to low my drains. He deployed The Emperor on Coruscant and got smacked by some more smugglers. I was in complete control of the was when time finished getting a timed win :-(<br/>
<br/>
TW (+18)<br/>
Overall: 1 (+18).<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Gay droids, no destinies for him.<br/>
Lows: forgetting Ozzel´s gametext. Timed win when in total control.<br/>
Ugly: The Emperor getting a beatdown at home.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of timed games and low differentials. Epic duel between Nacho Esteban and Ignacio ends with a huge loose for Nacho Esteban. After winning two tourneys undeeated he scored his first loss, sorry man.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : My WYS vs Miguel Abarca´s Raltiir troopers from hell.<br/>
<br/>
This was a pretty quick game. Miguel is a newbie that has been playing this deck for a while and plays it fairly well. I´ve playtested vs him several times and always win (just one timed win because I played like a scrub) so I was confident. I set up on turn turn but was unable to avoid his third turn flipping (I knew I could make it later on). I know he´s low on ships so most of my guys reinforce my ground troops. He tries an early beatdown but I was prepared and he got smacked by my destinies and ground power. That was game. He should have waited more. I flipped back his objective with a couple of Palace Riders on Patrol Crafts and ECC Chewie and Dash with gay droids on space. Bubo came to Tatooine trying to eat Mirax but I played Fallen Portal killing it. I drained him to death.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+20)<br/>
Overall 3 (+38)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: easy and fast win. <br/>
Lows: beating Miguel again. <br/>
Ugly: Bubo and his fallen portal.<br/>
<br/>
This was my 6th game of the day and I´m getting tired. I´ve been lucky winning that fast, some more timed games because we just had 40 minutes for each game. That was bull. I don´t know what was wrong with Javi (the Judge, who runs these tourneys). He always runs smooth.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : My Surgeon vs Rafa´s RTP<br/>
<br/>
RTP sucks but Rafa is one of the best players here and his deck is full of dirty tricks played to its maximum. We have played this game before and I know it´s going to be a tough game. Collapsing Death Star sites will be key but I cannot get my proton bombs or I can´t shake him fast. I deploy Brangus on DS. Then I made a critical mistake and cheated. It was absolutely involuntary and feel sickly sorry for this. I asked Rafa if Brangus, being a warrior, could escort Leia (Prisoner version). He checked his obj. and say Yes. That was his fault too. Prisoner´s game text (not objective) says it cannot being taken out of prison by DS.  So Brangus took Leia as I was hoping to shuttle them to a Dreadnaught cruiser. <br/>
<br/>
He deployed some guys to DS:db and a Lift Tube. Order to engage and placed them in front of Brangus. I could not get Point Man and was loosing three every turn until I could shuttle them. Finally I got my Proton Bombs and began collapsing DS sites (yes, I can). I collapsed the dbay for I knew he had Death Star Plans and the all but one. He asked then I had to drain (for 0) on my DS while collapsing. I said yes and then I knew he had Surprise Assault. Bombers are vulnerable vs this card so I pack Tarkin´s Orders but I could not get it. I could not drain on Endor or Sullust with bombers because of this and couldn´t get my Dread Cruisers. I finally got two of them and set a force drain of two. He was draining for two but I was cancelling one of his force drains and got my retrieval engine (TIEs + Brangus) working. I was trying to set my Short Range Figthers retrieval when Falcon hit my Dreads (Lando and EPP Luke piloting). Danm! I could not overload Luke with my destiny. He killed my ships and lost Lando. I could not overload Luke and knew I was lost. Judge called time and I decided to draw. I felt unworhty of a timed win for my unvoluntary cheating and Rafa has always been nice to play with but Judge didn´t let me (I was amazed, I could not believe it!) so he got a timed win by 15.<br/>
<br/>
TL (-15)<br/>
Overall 3 (+23)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: nothing<br/>
Lows: almost anything.<br/>
Ugly: cheating! I suck. Sorry Rafa once more.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of timed games again. People´s getting angry. Talk with Angel Dj San José and he wants quitting. He wanted to draw but he could not (just like me). One of the three Ignacios (the who beated Esteban on Game one) is leading.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 : Surgeon vs David WYS<br/>
<br/>
This was quite funny and shows how deadly bombers can be. David is a newbie in Star Wars but he has been playtesting heavily and got a pretty good deck. I start as usual, Oppressive Enforcement (not the combo), Planetary Subjugation and Mob. Points. He starts Insurrection, Squad @#$% and Stag. Areas. If played smart Surgeon just kills WYS. I set SFS first turn and drawed for Proton Bombs. He stablished a small foothold on Tatooine dbays and flipped. I had my suicidal tendencies EPP Vader on hand and paid a visit to Mirax. A Palace Rider reacted, Mirax was hit with saber and everybody died (since reactin flipped back his objective he only got two low destinies). Brangus changed a db for Vader (that happened several times through the game). He set up again on the ground and drawed. I put a Dread cruiser and two Scimtars with Proton Bombs and Concussion Missiles. He was scared of a beatdown in space and could get just Dash and Outrider so he deployed everythind on db tryng to commit enough forces and then head to Tatooine system. That was his greatest mistake. Here´s how it happened:<br/>
<br/>
Dash, Outrider, Talon Karde, a Palace Rider and a Patrol Craft on the Tatooine db.<br/>
<br/>
A Palace Rider and a Patrol Craft on the &lt;&gt; db (Tatooine)<br/>
<br/>
Empty Cantina<br/>
<br/>
My surgical team over Tatooine system and a tracked 5 destiny<br/>
<br/>
Result: my turn, activate, drain for two and collpasing Tatooine db=corpses everywhere. His deck was pale. He had never faced a bomber deck and he learned it the hard way. Not much from this point. I drained him to death while Vader made some suicidal runs once again (finally winning the Cantina and draining him there). Full win by 20.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+20)<br/>
Overall 5 (+43)<br/>
<br/>
More timed games everywhere so I was on a good position with a poor performance. Ignacio won with 6 points and pulled a foil Lord Vader. Nacho Esteban was second and got a  foil Masterful Move . Aramburu was third and I finished on fourth.<br/>
<br/>
Props.<br/>
Ignacio for winning and pulling a foil Lord Vader .<br/>
Nacho Esteban for getting second after loosing first game.<br/>
My Surgeon deck. Too fun and good performance.<br/>
Rafa for playing RTP and winning.<br/>
Peri for being a cool guy with weird decks.<br/>
Angel, take it easy man.<br/>
<br/>
Slops<br/>
Javi, the Judge, for running a bull tourney (you always get props but this time you deserve this).<br/>
Me, for my mistake vs RTP<br/>
ISB, I love ISB but it´s just fuc.king slow and not commiting seppuku.<br/>
Tarin bros for not coming.<br/>
<br/>
That´s all. I hope you enjoyed.<br/>
