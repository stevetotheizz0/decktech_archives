<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hi-Ho cheerio here is the obligitory Mirkwood TR from tuesday night.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-Tourney crap, okay I went with a High-destiny TIGIH retrieval deck for LS, and Deadbodys BHBM (on my page) for dark, except those were not what I really wanted to go with, but since I had a foot of water in my basement on Monday night, I really didn’t have time to build anything new.  so on to the games here goes.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my DS vs. Rich Jeffrey and his HB B-wings of death.  Okay this game was really pretty fun, I set up early with Empy Janus at endor DB, Igar in Tempest 1 at Hoth Db and Lord Vader with stick at Yavin db.  Hwe gave me Luke, but my drains were still pinging him.  THen Thrawn and the Exec. went into space to take on the B-wing he had sitting at Kessel, after firing 2 weapons and using the card that lets you add the destiny number of a weapon you just fired into your total power he had 1 b-wing at power 21 WTF??? I lost a force from the battle.  He lost a b-wing, I probed , not it.  He comes down with another B-wing and guns battles tries to Power Pivot, oh hell no, sense got it (I lose sense and 2).  We tie the battle this time, what is this, 1 damn starfighter can take on The super-Star destroyer, and get away with it???  I put Bossk and Dengar at the other end of space, and probed drained, I got his HB on the third try, didn’t really matter, I had the game totally under control.  My drains and the big E. did him in  FW by 19.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: owning this game, unlike Justin I have no problem beating Rich.<br/>
Lows: POWER 21 B-wings WTF????????<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my Ls vs. Graham Neal and his skrilling Death Horde.<br/>
<br/>
Uh Oh, not good I don’t like this deck, and it has killed me multiple times, oh well.  I got a great opening hand, with a grabber and a sense for NSP plus Lando and Ben Kenobi, and Gotm.  He gets his sites and the sail barge, says go.  I move luke to the db, go. He puts Chall and Boelo in the chamber, while he is drawing I use GotM to pull obis stick.  My turn Obi and Lando come into the chamber, he didn’t have a NSP so I battle, poke Boelo he out, swing at Chall hit dead plus 12 overflow.  That was game, he came back with baby jabba ephant mon, pote and a skrilling, poke Ephant mon excluded, chop jabba, battle destiyn costs him everyone else, I cancel scum.  Move out to Jabbas palace to utilize fallen portal.  He deploys Merc. Pilot and 5 skrillings aboard and pote to the chamber, plus gallid. Battles me, I screw up and don’t fallen portal, and instead try to On the edge the 6 I had stacked (after drawing a few weapon destinys) and retrieve 5 with luke, I miss count, and Luke dies. I kill 3 skrillings.  My turn I clash the Merc. Pilot and the whole ship goes down in a flaming ball of crap, all the skrillings were hit or excluded (Han with Gun came to join the party) and he lost everthing.  I then moved into the chamber adn put out Order to Engage.  The rest of the game was me draining for 3 and OtEing him for 3 while he tried to run away.  Fw by 29<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I bent Grahmas Skrillings over the table, yeah.. Take that pote, you know you like it.<br/>
Lows: Uh  I did kill Luke by mistracking, oh well didn’t matter.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 my Ds vs Josh Grace and his Dag. Mains<br/>
<br/>
Okay this sucks, I now have to play our resident 2000+ player (after graham who is 1900 something)  oh well, I really like Josh, me and Justin ahve started to playtest with him some and it is makeing us better players, but on to the game.<br/>
<br/>
I did the usual set up, pull carida and IC for Ozzel at the DB, plus empy on his throne, I just activated and drew for a few turns till I got what I needed, He got set up with Yoda at his hut, Luke w/saber at my Endor DB, and Ben and Lando at Tat. DB.  The game was pretty much me chasing him around with Igar and Veers in walkers with Guri as a passenger, he wouldn’t split up his forces, and since I could I got Sim and Janus drainign at at DB, and Chirneau in the Exec. draining for 2 at Carida, I took Luke in the middle of the game with Lord Vader and Saber, and I did the smart thing chase his horde of characters around with ym squad who he was afraid to battle, the only mistake I made was I battled With Sim Janus Ozzel and the 2 BH droids, he portaled 4-lom and Ozzel, shot Janus and Sim, I missed on the capture, andd he put advantage on Obi.  THe constant ping of that and from my objective (although we both forgot about it for a few turns, would have made a difference, this was a very close game) I started SSPFT so his retrieval was limited, and after he lost his last one off the top it was game.  Fw by 10 since BHBM and Advantage were killing me, and my drains aren’t huge.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I beat Josh, haven’t done that in a while.  Very fun close game against a great opponent.<br/>
Lows: We both forgot to make me lose force from my objective, I started again when I thought of It Josh noticed after I said something. This win feels tainted, sorry man, you know it wasn’t intentional.  I really do still feel bad about it.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 my Ls vs. Josh Grace and his ISB Big Blue.<br/>
<br/>
This game was never really in doubt, I made him waste a lot of cards battleing me, and I got him for about 10 when Ozzel took luke and he couldn’t find vader.  Long story he drained in space (my deck has NO space0 we battled some at the Tat. DB, and he finally wore me out of characters, although I did make him stack 2 and cost him cards.  Sorry this is so short, but nothing of note really happened, and this was relatively uneventful, unblockable drains of 8 will do that.  FL by 12<br/>
<br/>
Okay so I went 3-1 +46 and ended up winning the tourney by 1 force over Mike Raveling, to get the Imperial Decree foil that I had been wanting (I play with that card so much I really wanted that foil version).<br/>
