<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">My Minnesota Grand Slam tourney by Michael Raveling.<br/>
<br/>
For light side I was using a Throne Room Gray Matter Oola deck..(See my Raveling’s Throne Room on Decktech) <br/>
For dark side I had a Bunker Gray Matter Emperor deck.. <br/>
(See my Raveling’s Bunker Deck on Decktech for more info)<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:<br/>
Light side vs Anthony Lawrence<br/>
Tony is a nice local player who gets intimidated when he plays me.  As I am shuffling my decks I notice a huge white stain on the back of my cards.  I turn it over and it is a stinkin Talz.  I run up to the Tourney Director and tell<br/>
him I need to change a card.  For some strange reason, he doesnt seem to have a Talz on hand (what player doesnt have a Talz??) but he lets me add in a Fallen Portal for my little Talz and I feel good.  No DQ yet for me.<br/>
Tony starts Endor Operations with Oppressive Enforcement, Secret Plans, and You Cannot Hide Forever.  I start Massassi<br/>
Throne Room with Strike Planning, Insurrection, and Staging Areas.  I pull out General Solo and Crix Madine.  For my first turn I put out a Hnemthe at the Endor Docking Bay and General Crix at the Home 1 Docking Bay.  I also deploy<br/>
the Home 1 Warroom.  On his first turn he draws his cards and gets Perimeter Patrol with YCHF.  Second turn I activate 14.  I deploy Kal Fal to the Echo docking bay and Beezer to Echo docking bay and save a few.  On his second<br/>
turn he deploys Ozzel for two and 4-Lom with Rifle to the Bunker which sets up his Perimeter Patrol.  He also sets down the Back Door which I think is strange.  Does he want me to have a drain of 2?  On my turn I get out Blount with<br/>
Madines text and I deploy him to the Bunker with General Solo, Chewie and Wedge.  I battle poor Ozzel and he loses a bunch of cards.  I move General Solo to the Endor Docking bay and move Beezer to the Back Door.  On my next turn I set up Oola at the Echo Docking bay and I scan every turn<br/>
after that.  I get some of unique scouts out of his hand but I see that he has a non-unique biker scout and a High Speed Tactics.  So I deploy Cracken to the Back Door.  I move Solo there as well while getting Bruckman and<br/>
Panno to the Endor Docking Bay.  I figure he would attack the Back Door rather than the Docking bay to try to knock out that drain of two.   His turn he puts out the scout down at the Endor Docking bay for 3 because of Hnemthe.  He battles and I draw enough destiny to kill his scout and he kills off Bruckman.  He doesnt do much else this game and<br/>
I drain him out while Oolaing him every turn.  Win by 31.<br/>
<br/>
I start out with a big win which is always nice.<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
My dark side Bunker deck vs Brandon Bjerke<br/>
I start the Bunker with Insurrection, Mob Points, and You Cannot Hide Forever.  My opponent starts Toche Station and Jabbas Audience Chamber using the Endor starting interrupt.  This will be the shortest game summary I have ever written because it was the shortest game I had in a long time.  On my turn I slap down Lt. Endicott at the DS2 Docking bay for free and get Perimeter Patrol at the bunker.  His turn he draws up.  On my second turn I<br/>
set up Trooper Felth at the Dark Forest and put Navy Trooper Fenson at the Bunker.  I also get Sarkli down at the Coruscant Docking bay.  So I am activating 12 on my third turn.  He deploys Han and Cracken to Toche Station<br/>
and draws a couple.  On my turn I deploy Ephant Mon to the Bunker and put down Mara Jade at the Back Door.  So now I have Endor completely secure and I can do what I want.  On his turn he gets some nice activation but draws<br/>
up.  When I go I put Vader w/saber and Tarkin down at Tosche Station with Ozzel.  I slice Cracken and cancel his destiny.  He loses a couple of force and I move Vader, Tarkin, Ozzel over to the Audience Chamber for a nice<br/>
drain of 2.  His turn he gets Obi w/ saber deployed to the Cloud City Carbonite Chamber.  My turn I drain for 4 and deploy 3 more Endor sites with 1 deploy guys at each.  I am draining now for 9 to his 2 so I leave Obi alone and finish out the game this way.  I do draw up a lot and deploy a<br/>
bunch but it was too tempting not to do.  <br/>
Win by 17.<br/>
<br/>
Before we play I notice that my opponent is from Iowa.  Now there have been some bad feelings between some people from Iowa and some of us Minnesotans because of a single jerk.  I was a bit tense playing against this guy as he was wearing a Bespin regional shirt, the scene of the whole Iowa/Minnesota clash.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:<br/>
My Massassi Throne room vs Seth VanWinkles SYCFA Tie Deck.<br/>
When he flips over SYCFA I think I am in for a tough game.  I have only one ship in my Throne room deck and that is the Home 1.  Hyperspeed of 3 means I am not going to be moving anywhere once that ship gets deployed.  Before I start I get my two generals.  I activate my 4.  I draw Oola and Home 1 Warroom in my opening hand and I set Oola down at the Home 1 Docking Bay and draw.  Second turn I will activate 8.  He deploys Weekulmui and puts down a<br/>
Tie Interceptor at the Death Star docking bay and another one at Weekulmui so now he has no lost pile.  On my turn I activate my 8 and deploy a Talz to the Echo docking bay.  I also deploy the Yavin 4 Warroom which makes me activate 13 on turn 3.  I draw a couple but save most of my force.  His turn he deploys Kashyyk and deploys a Dreadnaught to Weekulmui.  I activate my 14 now and I have enough to scan his hand with Oola.  I get rid of his Mjerik<br/>
(System getter guy) and that is it.  No other guys and only one other ship.  I deploy Madine and Bruckman to the DS docking bay and kill his Tie fighter to the used pile.  He draws on his turn looking for cards I guess.  On my<br/>
next turn I scan his hand again.  I have a Grimtaash but there is nothing in his hand to use it on.  I draw to try to get Home 1 and I find it.  So I save some more force.  On his turn he deploys a Tie Interceptor to Kashyyk<br/>
and tries to move the Dreadnaught over to join it but I point out that the hyperspeed of the dreadnaught wont get there.  His tie is stuck.  He draws.<br/>
On my turn I scan him with Oola and see that he has 2 All Power To Weapons.  Here is where I did a little bit of thinking.  I could Grimtaash him now and<br/>
get rid of those 2 cards or wait for him to get some ties before I do it.  I choose to wait.  My turn I deploy Home 1 to Kashyyk but it gets barriered.  I save 4 force.  At the end of my turn he plays All Power To Weapons and<br/>
gets 3 tie Interceptors.  I then Grimtaash him as soon as he does it.  Now he has lost 5 cards and 3 of them were Ties.  On his turn he plays All Power To Weapons again to get 3 ties but I forced him to use both his All Power to<br/>
Weapons as lost interrupts.  He deploys all of them to Kashyyk but doesnt battle.  On my turn I put down General Solo, Chewie, Leia with Blaster on board the Home 1.  I<br/>
battle and cancel his destiny.  I draw a zero and a 1 but I have enough power to kill off all his ties except the one that goes to the used pile.  He had no All Power To Weapons.  Now I have a drain of three at his locations.  He deploys Kiffex and Nal Hutta.  When I scanned his hand I saw<br/>
he had Nal Hutta but I didnt expect him to deploy it.  It is at parsec 3 which means I can get there with Home 1.   Otherwise he would have a free drain and retrieval at Kiffex and I all I could do would be just sit at Kashhyyk and watch.  He does deploy it and he puts a Tie Interceptor at both newly deployed systems.  On my turn I deploy Panno to the SpacePort Docking Bay and I move the Talz to join him.  I also move the Home 1 to Nal Hutta.  His Tie is stuck.  He deploys another Tie to Nal Hutta and moves his Dreadnaught over as well.  On my turn I deploy Melas to the Back Door.  The Super Home 1 initiates battle and I<br/>
cancel his destiny again.  I guess I had the Home 1 kinda like Vader/Tarkin/Executer/Han/Leia all rolled into one.  He doesnt play All Power To Weapons and I wonder if I killed all of them that he had.   I draw a 4 and a zero.   He loses the dreadnaught.   On his turn he puts down<br/>
another Tie at Kashyyk to drain but doesnt back up Nal Hutta.  I deploy a Hnemthe to Home 1 and battle his remaining ties.  They all die this time except the one that goes to used.  He loses about 4 more force.  I fly the<br/>
Home 1 back to Kashyyk.  He has no more fight left in him and I drain him out without giving a real big smack at Kashyyk.  I win by 16.<br/>
A good fun game and this Iowan was in no way related to that Iowa jerk I had experienced at regionals.  Daniel Meyer and I talked about the whole Iowa vs Minnesota thing and it comes down to one person leaving a bad impression.<br/>
Then I felt bad because Dan and I had a bad game last year where I wasnt very friendly to him.  I felt bad for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I have been sitting in the number one position from game 2 till now.  I knew I was going to play one of the big guns from Bespin but I didnt know who.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:<br/>
My Dark Side Bunker vs Zach Stenerson<br/>
Zach is from North Dakota and has been one of the up and coming players.  He was at the Bespin Regionals,Gen Con, and Deciphercon.  So he has been around and has been tutored by Jonathan Swenson, the number 1 in Bespin.  In fact Zach had just beat Swenson in game 3 and had been saying before the tourney how he was going to go undefeated with his new decks.  Plus the night before I had playtested with Zach which made me afraid that he knew every secret of<br/>
my deck and would know immediately how to beat it.  This all equates to me knowing that I am in for a hard game.<br/>
I flip my Bunker and pull Mob Points, IAO, and You Cannot Hide Forever.  He flips Mind What You Have Learned and starts with Wise Advice, Battle Order, and Your Insight Serves You Well.  If you read the review of my Dark Side Bunker Deck then you know some people said I would have a hard time vs this deck type.  Here is the match up.<br/>
In my opening hand I draw Mosep, a Forest Clearing, and 2 guys that deploy for 1.  First I deploy Wakeelmui and then put Elsek down at the DS2 docking bay and draw 3.  His turn involves getting Yoda to Yodas Hut.  So second turn I am activating 7.  I deploy Trooper Felth to the Bunker and put Mosep down with Officer Evax at the Forest Clearing.  I hope that Mosep drain can get some critical cards from out of his reserve deck.  For his turn he puts down Melas with Yoda to train and deploys Great Warrior using the text on<br/>
the Training Area.  I figure I have only a single turn to drain for two at the Forest Clearing.  My turn I pay the three to drain him of Squadron Assignments and an On The Edge which I am glad to see go.  I put Ephant Mon<br/>
down at the Bunker and move Felth over to join Mosep and Evax at the clearing.  His first try to train test one succeeds and he completes Great Warrior.  I am not going to have luck on my side for this game.  He inserts me with Anger Fear Aggression and I dont have a Projective Telepathy so I will have to eat the 4 damage.  He draws.  On my turn AFA comes up and I have to lose the 4.  I pay the 3 to drain him for 1 from his reserve and another On The Edge goes to the lost pile.  Now I am guessing that I have killed most of his retrieval.  I draw up and I figure if I take a quick turn that he will forget about AFA and I will save my force.  He remembers though and I lose the four cards.  On his turn he slaps a Projection of a Skywalker down at the Forest Clearing and suddenly Mosep is doing nothing.  He inserts another AFA and draws some more.  My turn AFA comes up and I have a Projective Telepathy for it.  He looks through his hand like he is going to grapple it but he doesnt.  I deploy the Back Door and put the Emperor there.  I move over all the guys from the Forest Clearing to that site and draw up.  On his turn he deploys another AFA into my deck and puts down Luke<br/>
w Saber at the Back Door.  I feel safe because of Perimeter Patrol.  He also plays Order to Engage.  He draws a few but saves some force.  AFA comes up when I activate but I know I am going to battle this turn so it will do no<br/>
damage.  I deploy Sim Aloo, Janus Greejatus, and 4-Lom with gun to the Back Door and battle.  He Clash of Sabers my Emperor and I shoot Luke with 4-Lom.<br/>
I draw my two destinies but he says that I can only draw one because Sim Aloo isnt in battle with the Emperor.  However I point out Sim Aloo only says when with the Emperor and old wrinkles is still with Sim at the site.<br/>
He should have clashed Sim I guess.  (Now I find out that I was wrong and that I should NOT have drawn my extra destiny.)  I draw a zero and a 4 for battle destiny.  He draws a 5.  I just lose Evax but he has to lose Luke and some more force.  I draw a couple to get more sites.  On his turn he draws up trying to regroup.  So on my turn I pay the 3 to drain for 2 at the Back Door from reserve.  I deploy Dark Forest with Mara Jade and deploy the Ewok<br/>
Village.  I also get Navy Trooper Fenson to the Bunker.  I move Janus Greejatus to Ewok Village.  After this turn I feel like I have set up nicely and am pretty confident in my win.  My opponent deploys Kessel on his turn<br/>
and then does a little magic.  He plays that card that retrieves an effect from lost pile to get Squadron Assignments, pulls Captain Han from reserve,<br/>
and puts the Super Falcon down at Kessel with Leia w/ blaster for company.<br/>
Now it is a drain race and I am not so confidant.  On my turn I drain for 4 from reserve and watch as Obi w/ Saber takes a dirt nap.  I draw a couple but save some force because I have a nice hand filled with some big guns.<br/>
His turn he drains for 3 at Kessel and puts down Orrimarko at the Dark Forest and Tawas Kha at the Ewok Village.  I point out that Tawas Kha is deploy +2 because of Navy Trooper Fenson and Zack gets mad that he doesnt<br/>
have enough force for more guys.  On my turn U-3Po visits the Ewok Village and I deploy Lord Vader and Tarkin over to Orrimarko.  I battle.  I cancel his destiny and he has to lose Orri and some more force.  I lose the 3 force<br/>
to Order To Engage and move Janus to Emperor and Sim.  Now Tawas is stuck but he can get around Battle Plan which sucks.  On his turn my opponent drains me for 3 and tries to put down Uncontrollable Fury on my Lord Vader.<br/>
He takes it back before I have to point Vaders game text out to him and curses Lord Vader. I think he is getting frustrated now.  The game turns into a drain race and<br/>
I wisely forfeit Boba Fett in Slave 1 from hand before I am even tempted to go up to Kessel..  The game ends with me draining for 3 from reserve.<br/>
I win by +12.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:<br/>
My Light Side Oola Force Generator vs Graham Neal<br/>
I start Massassi Throne Room with Staging Areas, Insurrection, and Strike Planning.  <br/>
Graham starts with Court of the Vile Gangster, All Wrapped Up, No Bargain, and Mob Points.  Graham has been playing variations of Scum since I can remember now.  On my first turn I deploy Obis Hut and Kal fal at the Home 1 Warroom.  He starts his turn by activating, deploying Rendili, and<br/>
pulling Jabba to the Audience Chamber.  My second turn I get General Calrissian and Nien Nunb at the Pit of Carkoon for some early drainage.  On Grahams next turn pulls the DS2 docking Bay and puts Bane Malar there.  He draws some.  So on my turn I deploy Madine to the Hoth Echo Docking Bay and pull out Major Panno.  I dont have enough force to deploy everything in my hand so I put down Blount and General Solo to the Pit and decide to wait a<br/>
turn to move to the Audience Chamber.  I also have Chewie,Panno, and Major Olander Brit in my hand so I have some firepower but I dont have enough force to deploy it all.  On his next turn he deploys Mara Jade to Obis Hut.  Which means trouble.  But which do I go for, the Audience Chamber or Obis Hut?<br/>
Now I cant just move over to the Audience Chamber because I have to protect that drain of 3.  I decide to go with Jedi Luke and I deploy him for 8 force to Obis hut and initiate a battle.  I actually remember first strike.  I only draw a 2 in destiny and he draws a 4.  We tie and he keeps Mara on<br/>
table.  Now I am screwed because I hoped Jedi Luke could kill Mara with a lucky destiny draw.  I cant move my guys to the Audience Chamber because I dont have enough to move them all.  On Grahams turn he deploys 4-Lom with<br/>
Rifle, IG-88 with Gun, and Mara Jades lightsaber to Obis.  Down comes Scum and Villainy.  In the battle, he shoots my Jedi Luke with 4-Lom and then hits him with Maras saber.  I draw my zero destiny this battle but Graham draws a 3 and a 4.  I have to lose a ton of force and Luke gets captured by 4-Lom because of All Wrapped Up.  Graham loses nothing.  On my turn I deploy Oola to Kal Fals site and deploy Chewie to the Pit of Carkoon.  I move all those guys over to the Audience Chamber to cancel Scum and Villainy.  Grahams turn he deploys Zuckuss in Mist Hunter to Rendili.  He<br/>
gets Boelo down with Jabba to battle and retrieves his 3 and I lose my one. I draw 3 destinies, zero, one, and four.  He cancels the four and loses all the guys at the Audience chamber.  But my destiny of 1 was the Home 1 and I<br/>
dont have enough force to activate it next turn.  I could have used it to take Rendili.  I have a tunnel vision in hand but no way to activate all the way to Home 1.  So I activate all my force and use 4 of it to cancel Scum<br/>
and Villainy and use some more to Oola his hand and see 2 Hidden Weapons.  I move Crix and Kal fal to the Tatooine Docking Bay.  Graham activates and drains me of 1 at the system and 4 at Obis Hut.  Here is where I get suddenly scared, I know the Home 1 is near the top of my reserve deck.  How do I keep it from being lost?  I lose everything in my hand down to the Tunnel Vision and Melas which I need.  I dont have any more places to lose from.<br/>
I have to lose from Reserve.  There goes Home 1.  Bye.  So now I will eat that drain in space for the rest of the game.  Graham draws up and ends his turn.  I activate and drain for 2 at the Audience Chamber but I forget about<br/>
Crix at the far end of Tattoine and I dont drain there.  I also dont Oola.  I move my forces over to the Pit of Carkoon and back up Crix with Panno and Olander Brit.  On Grahams turn he slaps another Scum and Villainy to the<br/>
Audience Chamber while draining for his 5.  He deploys Boba with Blaster and Dengar with Blaster to Crixs site.  He battles and retrieves a bunch.  He plays Hidden Weapons on Crix and captures him.  He shoots Kal fal with Boba<br/>
Fet and shoots both my other guys with Dengar.  I have 0 forfeit.  He draws a 2 for destiny and I draw a 1 and 4, because of Panno and Brit.  He loses Dengar for attrition because Court makes him forfiet plus 2.  I lose<br/>
everyone.  Things are looking desperate for me.  So on my turn I move my mass of guys over to Obis Hut.  Graham battles me at the Hutt and captures Chewie with Ig-88.  He then shoots Nien Nunb with 4-lom.  Now I have one<br/>
destiny and zero chance to retake the Hut.  I draw a 1 for destiny and all my guys die.  <br/>
Graham drains me out and I lose by 16.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:<br/>
My Dark Side bunker deck vs Garrett Larson<br/>
I start my Endor Bunker with Mob Points, IAO, and You Cannot Hide Forever.<br/>
Garrett starts the Hollowtable with Your Insight Serves You Well, the card that lets you pull Shocking Information, and Lets Keep a Little Optimism Here.  Garrett has a strange starting set up and Josh Grace says "Garrett<br/>
isnt going to let you play any of your cheese."  I guess he was more scared of losing to operatives or inserts than he was of any of the traditional stratagies.<br/>
In my opening hand I have Overseeing it Personally and Perimeter Patrol so I dont know what to do with You Cannot Hide Forever.  I just leave that on table the whole game.  I pull Wakeelmui and activate.  I set up Endicott at the Ds2 Docking Bay and draw.  I now have 2 Projective Telepathies in my hand.  I am suddenly nervous because when I filled out my deck list I remember thinking..."Why do I only have 1 Projective Telepathy in this<br/>
deck??  I should have 2?"  Did I only have 1 Projective Telepathy on my decklist?  So now I am scared of having a repeat performance of my DecipherCon DQ.   Anyway, Garrett draws on his turn.  On my turn I deploy the forest clearing and put Ozzel at the Bunker with DS-181-4 at the Forest Clearing.  Garrett pulls Shocking Information using his starting effect.  He plays it on me to recycle into his reserve.  I ask him why he did that and he says that he has an easy trackable 5-destiny card that lets him look<br/>
through his reserve.  Garrett spends his first couple of turns drawing up and I spend my first couple draining him for two.  Then he saves some force so I know that he has drawn a spy and is going to deploy to the bunker and<br/>
kill me.  Luckily I have drawn Ephant Mon the turn before so I deploy him to the Bunker and back up Endicott with Evax and Colonel David Jon.  A waste of 2 characters<br/>
but I couldnt find my Ghkk.  I guess right and he deploys Boush to my DS2 docking bay with Obi w saber and Orrimarko.  He battles me, I play<br/>
Projective Telepathy, he pays, and I have plenty of forfeit to cover his battle damage.  I have to lose the 2 from Orrimarko but that is ok.  I deploy U-3PO to cover the DS2 docking bay because I figure he is free to move anywhere else.  I deploy a couple of more Endor sites and I spread out some guys.  It takes me forever to get the Emperor even though I started with Overseeing It Personally in my hand.  Garrett deploys the Cantina and puts some heavy hitters like Han with Blaster and Luke with Saber there.  So<br/>
I eat that drain while I drain for a million at Endor.  It turns into a drain race becuase Garrett is not going to come to Endor.<br/>
I win +15.<br/>
After the game Garrett tells me I was lucky to put Ephant Mon out when I did because it would have been a way different game if he had taken the Bunker.  I agree with him and I am thankful I have 3 of that guy in this deck.<br/>
Now I find out that I made it into the Final Duel for the set of uncut sheets.  I am nervous because I have never made it into a final duel before.<br/>
My opponent is Josh Grace.<br/>
Now...the final duel.<br/>
<br/>
It is Josh Grace and me in the final duel.  We havent played each other today but I have played these exact decks versus him in a tournament a week earlier.  I lost both times to him.  We also played this Tuesday and I beat up on his dark side deck.  So we both know anything can happen.  <br/>
I enter the final duel with a wierd mindset.  I am thinking that I dont care if I win or lose just that I am not all tense about it and that I have fun.  This is different from my normal attitude where I try hard to win and part of the fun is based on my performance.  In addition my mind is already fried from playing six games.  These two games are examples of how I play stupid after more than 6 hours of SWCCG.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 of final duel:<br/>
I am light side with my Massassi Throne Room, Staging Areas, Insurrection, Strike Planning start.<br/>
Josh is using his Hunt Down deck that starts Mob Points, IAO, and Battle Order.  In my opening hand I have Chief Chirpas Hutt and Oola.  I am sitting pretty.  I grab Madine and General Solo using strike planning and I sit Oola down at the Home 1 db.  Josh starts by deploying the Executer docking bay and draws some.  I activate my 6 force<br/>
and get out the Hoth Docking Bay.  Here is where I start to play stupid.  I am too worried about Visage right now. <br/>
Instead of waiting to do Oola I draw cards.<br/>
I get the Endor Back Door in my hand.  Josh puts out the only space system that either of us see that game, Rendili.  On my next turn I set Madine and<br/>
Bruckman down at the Back Door because I have a fallen Portal in my hand and I am excited to use it.  I also want to use Madines game text on my next turn to get out a spy and cancel Visage.  I shoulda just put Madine down at<br/>
the Hoth Docking Bay and saved to do Oola.<br/>
On Joshs next turn he deploys Vader w/saber and Tarkin down to the back Door and battles.  Now I realize that I was stupid for putting out the Back Door and should have just<br/>
waited to do Oola.  If Madine gets killed then I am stuck.  Josh initiates a battle and I play Fallen Portal to try to get Tarkin.  I draw a 3 and kill off the Grand Moff.  So it is just Vader w saber.  Josh swings at Madine but draws a 3.  I laugh but not too hard.  I almost had a huge mistake in this game.  Josh draws some destiny and I have to forfeit Bruckman and I draw a zero so vader w Saber lives.  On my next turn I deploy General Solo, Chewbacca, and Liea w Blaster.  Josh has his objective flipped and when I<br/>
try to initiate a battle he points to it and says "Nope."  I feel stupid because I have made this mistake about 5 times in tournaments against Hunt Down where I deploy Luke to space to drain, or Liea down to battle.  I stupid.<br/>
So now all my power guys are just sitting there.<br/>
On Joshs turn he deploys the Emperor to his Visage to protect it from my spies which he knows are going to come down next turn.  He contemplates battling with Vader but wisely moves to Chief Chirpas Hut and draws.  I<br/>
still havent done Oola.  On my turn I use Madine to get Blount from my reserve and I deploy him to the Emperor.  Force Lightning comes out but Josh misses with it.  I breathe a sigh of relief.  Down comes Major Panno, Wedge,<br/>
Hnemthe,and Major Olander Brit.  I battle and draw two destiny.  Josh goes "what the" and has to read Major Brit.  The Emperor takes a dirt nap and Visage goes to the lost pile.  I draw and get a Grimtaash which I play used.<br/>
Half of Joshs hand goes to the used pile and on his turn he has to draw to restock.  Now on my turn I dont do Oola again but instead deploy Home 1 to Rendili and move Leia over to Chirpas hut so I can drain at the Back Door.  Josh deploys Zuckuss in Mist Hunter w/ Boba Fett w Blaster to battle me at Rendili and draws a 4 in battle destiny.  I have to lose a few cards but Home 1 stays.  On my turn I look over my hand and I have a Hnemthe and Major Cracken but somehow I think that Home 1 only has ability of 2 so I decide I need more pilots to draw destiny against Zuckuss.  So I do Oola on my control phase and get rid of his pilots but he has the Chimera sitting in his hand and an AT-AT.  I<br/>
deploy Cracken to the Home 1 and put the Hnemthe down to the Cloud City docking bay.  Now I should just stop writing this tourney-report because that is the stupidest move I did of the night.  Why did I put that Hnemthe down at the docking bay and not at the system???  Joshs turn he puts down Blizzard 2 at the Cloud City Docking Bay and the Chimera at Rendili and battles me both places.  I decide to lose Home 1, Cracken, and the Hnemthe.<br/>
Now I am screwed.  On my turn I put down Wioslea at the Cantina and wait to die.  He deploys Tempest 1 to the Back Door and moves Vader over.  When he puts out Come Here You Big Coward so that I cant drain at the Executer any more and<br/>
he kills my wimp Wioslea at the Cantina.  I die.<br/>
Lose by -12 but I can come back in game two.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
My dark side Bunker deck vs Josh Grace<br/>
I start the Bunker, Mob Points, IAO, and You Cannot Hide Forever.  <br/>
Josh uses Hidden Base with Strike Planning, Squasin, and Insurrection.  This game was really slow and Josh drained for 1 the whole game at Endor system with<br/>
Wedge, General Cal, and Nien Nunb all together.  I deployed only the Ewok Village and the Dense Forest so that he could not land any of his starships and had to fight me by deploying.  I could not find any of my three Ephant Mon’s<br/>
so Josh continually deployed Obi w Saber and Luke W Saber and Lt. Blount to the Bunker.  I lost Pol Treidum and Evax to his first battle.  That was ok because as I was losing force I saw 1 Ephant Mon go, then another one.  I thought that was wierd they were together.  Then my third one went right in a row.  So I sat there staring at my lost pile as all my Ephant Mons were right together.  To block the drain I deploy U-3P0 to the bunker but I need to get Perimeter Patrol back or I am in trouble.  I load up Tarkin and Vader w Saber to take out the trio of Obi,Luke, and Blount.  I was so out of it that I forgot to swing Vaders saber at anyone.  Josh evacuates from the Bunker and I forget to move U-3po thinking that Joshs own Projection of a Skywalker would prevent him from draining at my Dense Forest.  I told you I was out of it.  Josh drains me at the Dense Forest and deploys Obi w/ saber to join Luke.   Josh then deploys Boussh to the Ewok Village to block my Emperor, Janus, Sim allo drain. I move U-3Po to him on his move phase.  I draw up my reserve looking for Lt. Pol Treidum because I had already forgotten that I lost him.  Josh drains me out by draining at the Endor system for 1 the whole game.  <br/>
I screwed up from start to finish and played like I was from another planet.  Josh wins by 14.<br/>
Josh gets all the uncut sheets and I get a foil Threepio.  <br/>
