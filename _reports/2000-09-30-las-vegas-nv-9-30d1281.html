<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well I hear about this tourney on Friday night. Then I decide that I have sucked lately and<br/>
that I need a win.  This will Be a Sealed deck tourney.  The format is quite weird.  We<br/>
draft from common base and take 45 cards of both allegiances. No deck building just<br/>
playskill and luck.<br/>
<br/>
First Game vs Noah Singer<br/>
	Well I start Home One Docking bay in all my games.  Noah starts the Cloud City<br/>
Port town district.  He uses mobilization points and pulls rendilli.  I set up shop and drain<br/>
for 1.  Noah eventually goes to the port town district.  I drop some random scrubs and a<br/>
gran.  I then begin a cool lock down.  Whenever Noah battles I retrieve a force into hand<br/>
it is always the character I just lost last turn.  I eventually take over the port town district<br/>
and drain there and in space.  Noahs spreads to tatooine but I have a force advantage and<br/>
just drain him out.  Fw +13<br/>
Highs: Winning and gran lock down<br/>
Lows: None<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs John Spadora<br/>
	Well john is a friend of mine and we always play.  I dont know what he has sot his<br/>
will be cool.  HE starts the Jundland wastes.  Uh oh, I luckily draw the hot defensive<br/>
perimeter and rain for 2 to match johns 2 on tatooine.  He eventually puts out a another<br/>
site and I go fight there I move my forces around, we are both low on force but john is up<br/>
2 drains on me, then I remember the counter assault I have I draw for it.  He drains for 1<br/>
and I play it I have 13 to 7 he loses 6, by now he cant do all he needs so I am able to hold<br/>
him off . Full Win +4<br/>
Highs: The counter assault<br/>
Lows: None<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs Chris Hines<br/>
<br/>
	Well we are the only undefeated pleased so we play.  He sets up at Bespin<br/>
(starting Location)  me at a tatooine docking bay.  We drain back nd forth.  I get a large<br/>
space fleet I am able to talon roll on of his two ships an play all power to weapons to beat<br/>
him down for 11.  That combined with my drain of two seal the victory after some minor<br/>
skirmishes.  I win. Full Win +8<br/>
Highs: space beatdown<br/>
Lows: None<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs Dan Christy <br/>
	Another friend, everyone I played was my friend so oh well.  He has this great<br/>
manipulation thing, for sealed deck but no battle grounds, he uses baragwins and devices<br/>
and den of thieves to block drains I only have 1 drain and eventually take over his Death<br/>
star 2 docking bay .  he moves to Coruscant docking bay, he counter assaults so I lose 12<br/>
my only force loss.  I eventually edge out a win by 8 Full Win +8<br/>
<br/>
So some how I win a tourney it has been about a month or two since I got back to school<br/>
and have been busier than you can imagine, I have dropped 100 points in Swiss to 18<br/>
something but my sealed is still high and if this goes in it will go up, I think I am like 2 in<br/>
the region.  All in all a fun, free, tourney that was just what I needed to keep me going I<br/>
was on the verge of quitting , because  I dont like not winning.  Oh well deciphercon is<br/>
next week so I wont be playing I hear a team tourney is coming up so I look forward to<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
