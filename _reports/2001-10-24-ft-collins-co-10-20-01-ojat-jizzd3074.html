So, ya.  I told my peeps in Ft. Collins that I wasn&amp;#8217;t even gonna show up cause I had something better to do than play Star Wars.  And that would have been to go play 7th Sea the role-playing game.  So I figured damn, I bet I could do both.  The Tournament is supposed to start at like 10:30am and its only gonna be like 4 games, and the games won&amp;#8217;t take long so we should be golden for a full day of gaming!  So I roll up quick at about 10:15 and see some of the regular Ft. Collins crew including Tom Meade, Joel Jackson, and of course John Arendt. (Non-Jesus version)  Me and John both talk about how neither of us have really been playing so we are both prolly gonna get rolled rolled by scrubs, but I make the astute observation that nah, we&amp;#8217;ll both roll our first 2 opponents than I&amp;#8217;ll have to play to you and lose to you twice, since John is an amazingly better player than me in the first place.  Will this be true?  Will my theories be correct?  You&amp;#8217;ll have to read the rest of this report to find out kids!<br/>
<br/>
I have a 1955 rating going into this making me like 126th in the world.  I will be playing the same decks that I usually play until Ref3 makes me change my decks.<br/>
Light: Pods, Profits, and @#$%es!]<br/>
Dark: Maul&amp;#8217;s Phat Palatial Estate on Tatooine<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 Tom Meade (1883) WYS vs. Maul&amp;#8217;s Hutt<br/>
Hum, I&amp;#8217;m beginning to see a pattern here.  Have I mentioned how I enjoy playing Tom in tournaments because I play test with him like 24-7?  Either way, he might beat me cause his WYS deck is God, although this is a bad match up for him.  So first turn I get the engine going, I pull Mara and Stick and start draining there.  I draw and I get Palpy and Janus to the Cantina.  So there I am draining for 5.  Oh he plays Podracing by the way.  And my deck finally draws really good against Podracing for ones, like I draw fives and stuff.  This is more like it.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t have the interrupts to mess with me enough and I actually win the race, which is of course key to me winning this game.  So I win the Race and then I begin to play Stupid, instead of saving force up for a big ole Beat Crew in Space since he had nothing in space I do some ground skirmishes, which makes me lose more force.  I continue to do that until I can get some space control and then I can fulfill his battle order.  As soon as I can start Draining for 7 freely I can win the game.  Full Win +22<br/>
<br/>
2 +22<br/>
Highs: I won a Podrace therefore I Win!  Right?<br/>
Lows: Playing Tom Meade for the 312th time.  If you look at my rating I&amp;#8217;m sure most of my points I took from him ; )<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Ian Rajala (1534) Observation Camera Deck vs Pods Profit and @#$%es!<br/>
Ok I need to explain Ft. Collins for one quick second.  There is a clique of about 3 or 4 people who play real old school.  Like so old school that they are oblivious to pure tech.  So they are scrubs right?  True, True, that they are.  So Ian starts with Combat Response to have the Cantina and Jundland Wastes, he put no aliens in the Cantina.  His first turn he plays an observation Holocam in the Cantina . . . So I automatically win!  Full Win +33<br/>
<br/>
4 +55<br/>
Highs: I got an auto-win cause somebody played a jank device card from Premiere . . . Which is pure balls!!<br/>
Lows: To be honest it was a fun game, just pure mains beats with Qui-Gon killing every alien In the world until Ian played Wuhr in the Cantina!<br/>
<br/>
Ok So I am 4 +55 and John Arendt is 4 + 48 . . . I wonder if?<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 John Arendt (2074) DS Senate vs. Pods, Profit, and @#$%es!<br/>
Ya, I have no idea how to play against Senate . . . And its even worse cause John is playing it.  Cause John takes the most popular deck out there and makes them really techish.  To be honest I played this match up to safe, I should have flipped right away and start to deliver the DD to hurt him quite a bit.  But I sold out for playing conservative . . . Most of that had to do with the fact that I drew one of those awesome 7 interrupt hands.  If things had been different I might have won.  As it is however I had to draw while I watched John set up Lotti Doddi in the Senate and start to dominate.  He plays the Advisor for Palace version of this deck . . . If there is one?  So he plays mains like Vader, Maul, Palpy, Tempest 1, imperial Commands all sorts of silliness.  So I get my sites out with my interrupts, he deploys Tempest 1 to the City Outskirts.  I decide to build up a force to beat down the Tempest One, and move into the AC Pop Han, win the Race, and then dominate.  Well I drop Qui-Gon, Leia, Chewie Protector, and something else to the Outskirts, and I then use Outskirts to look for Obi-Wan, but he&amp;#8217;s not there.  So I battle cancel Igar&amp;#8217;s game text with Chewie, draw a one for destiny.  I lose Leia cause Palpy is there to draw destiny.  I tried to hit Palpy with Qui-Gon&amp;#8217;s stick but John plays Force Field, which is too good of a card in his senate deck.  My woes continue, John  plays Maul and stick to the Underground Passages and plays Zuckuss in Space to Tatooine.  So he gets to drain freely now, an I can&amp;#8217;t do @#$% about space of course.  I still haven&amp;#8217;t flipped yet, I need to look for a Ben in my Force pile, and I do, John lets me flip, knowing that I&amp;#8217;ll have a hard time spreading out, cause If I do he&amp;#8217;ll hose me with a Vader and Stick.  I don&amp;#8217;t get a Luke until really late game.  And I never get to battle anyone on MY terms cause John is playing so defensively, and I can&amp;#8217;t afford to really drain cause he&amp;#8217;ll just cancel with his effects.  The last dumb thing I do is to use my Panaka Hit and Run on either the Tempest 1, Maul, or the Emperor . . . Well I know he has a force field so Empy and Maul are right out, so I have to go against Tempest 1 which has Thrawn on it.  I come down, battle, I hit, I need him to draw low destiny, he draws a 6 so I lose 5 force, In my last attempt to win the game I get hosed for 5 force, I wasn&amp;#8217;t a bit surprised.  He retrieves force with squabble and I lose the game.  Full Loss - 12.<br/>
<br/>
4 +43<br/>
Highs: Losing to John is like losing to Tiger Woods, you know its prolly gonna happen, but its fun every time it happens.<br/>
Lows: Not playing the game the way I should have, but without a Ben Kenobi to save the day its really hard to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 4 John Arendt (2074) Dagobah Hit and Run vs. Maul&amp;#8217;s Hutt.<br/>
Oh and this is the worst match up for me, So I WILL get rolled.  My first turn I play Mara from deck with stick to do some early damage to John.  John plays Projection on his turn, so I have to pay 3 to drain for one.  Next turn I move over to drain at another site.  Next turn John plays his other Projection, tells me he had them both in his opening hand.  AWESOME!  So not only is he going to win this race, but I can&amp;#8217;t drain anywhere cause of Projection, save 2 battlegrounds, and he just inserted AFA on his turn also.  I tried a lot of stuff, but it just sucked, cause this deck is gay, and John is well aware of its gayness.  Just by getting rid of AFA will not make this deck any weaker either.  I would comment more on this game, but thinking about is like watching a train wreck.  Full Loss -16.<br/>
<br/>
4 + 27<br/>
Highs: Losing to a jizz deck via OJAT!<br/>
Lows: JIIIIIIZZZZZZ!!!!! NOOOOOO!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I get like 6th places cause I went 2-2.  I don&amp;#8217;t mind losing to John as I have mentioned in many a TR before.  He is a great player, but the fact that I am prolly going to lose more points from it, just isn&amp;#8217;t as good.  I Got a Pack of REF2 as prize support, and Brock actually got foils in this time!  Course I didn&amp;#8217;t win, so it matters not.  Brock also got in his EP1 foils too.  So Sean Burns got his Darth Maul, which looks so @#$%ing cool I have to say.  I and I didn&amp;#8217;t mention how every game between me and John took like 2 hours a piece since we are both trying to outplay each other.  So not only did I suck it up in the big picture, but I way  missed my 7th Sea game, sigh. However I didn&amp;#8217;t miss my Deadlands game, so I did geek out for a long period of time.  After the tournament I did some pick up games with Burnsy testing my EP1 decks against Sean&amp;#8217;s Open decks.   DS Senate vs. WYS was a bad match up but my light side 3PO/Shmi/Yoda pile kicked @#$% against open Senate!<br/>
<br/>
Props<br/>
Brock: Thanks for running it, again, can&amp;#8217;t wait for the next one!<br/>
Mom: For driving me to the tournament!<br/>
John Arendt: For still being the classiest Star Wars player in the World, despite cutting off the Jesus hair.  <br/>
Ian: For playing Observation Holocam . . . BALLS!<br/>
Tom Meade: For letting me beat him ; )<br/>
EPP MAUL and QUI-GON: For looking so damn cool, I want to flood the market with these!!!<br/>
Quan Mueller: For finding the cards that I thought got stolen!  Quan is also another classy player, that I rarely get to play against.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Slops<br/>
Wuhr: For making all my Lightsabers lost!<br/>
Dagobah Jizz Deck: I mean honestly, it is pure Jizz, spraying in my face . . . What the @#$% state is this . . . Arizona?<br/>
Profit Deck: Mother @#$%er!  It lost to a non-Maul&amp;#8217;s Hutt deck!!  So now it like 32-4, 3 of those losses being to John Arendt!<br/>
Sean Burns: For not trading me your new Darth Maul Card! <br/>
Chris Fanchi: Cause your name is still Parker Fodder!<br/>
<br/>
I can&amp;#8217;t wait to go to the Reflection 3 pre-release in Denver this Saturday so I can get 12 defensive shields in my sealed deck!<br/>
-OUT<br/>
