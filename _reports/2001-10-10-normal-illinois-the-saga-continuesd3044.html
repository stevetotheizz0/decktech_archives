<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">It’s getting really cold here in Illinios.  I really have no pretourney garbage, since all the details of my life are already archived in the random articles that I write.  So 8 of us showed up, and we played some games.  Here you go.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1- My Huntdown Podracing vs. Matt Hempsteds TIGIH <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I got off to a terrible start. I didn&amp;#8217;t draw a vader for about 4 turns, and my own visage was killing me. About turn 5, I won the podrace, and he lost 11 and I retrieved 9, because I hadn&amp;#8217;t lost 11 yet. Matt put Luke w/stick and Qui-gon w/stick at the landing platform, and Blount at the hut to add to my drains. I put the emperor and a presence at the podrace arena to drain for 2, but matt was draining me for 5 at the landing platform. I finally drew a vader, so I put vader and tarkin at the landing platform and took luke. I battled, but then matt played fallen portal and took out tarkin. I lost vader and like 6, and then we just traded drains until he drained me out. <br/>
<br/>
FL 5 0(-5) <br/>
<br/>
Highs-Winning the podrace <br/>
Lows- getting fallen portaled <br/>
Ugly- My own visage whipping my @#$% the whole game <br/>
<br/>
Game 2- My WYS beatdown vs. James Paluskas Court <br/>
<br/>
I drew a ok starting hand, with one han and two tunnel visions. I searched for kessel, but it was in my force pile. I tunneled for my luke, and drew a triple damage and run luke run. James had some monkeys at the chamber and zuckuss at tatooine. I deployed han to the chamer with a palace raider, and luke at the adjacent site. I battle, run luke run, don&amp;#8217;t get @#$%y, shoot xizor and play sorry about the mess to make him immediately lost. I cut jodo, and drew about a 15 for destiny. He lost by 28, times 3, he loses 84. Game. But james is a really cool guy because I made a major mistake during the game. He had the ephant man at the chamber, and I deployed Han, when I wasn t supposed to. James, if there are any cards you need, talk to me and I will hook you up. <br/>
<br/>
FW 32 2(+27) <br/>
<br/>
Highs- Hitting someone for 84 in one battle <br/>
Lows- Me deploying han to the ephant man when I shouldn t have <br/>
Ugly- Ditto <br/>
<br/>
Game 3- My WYS vs. Fairbanks Black sun <br/>
<br/>
I got a terribly slow start, not drawing a han, luke, or trippler for almost the entire game. He moved xizor to a generic docking bay with a makurth and a vigo to flip. He drained me for 2 for several turns, and then I came down with chewie, lando w/gun, and a RFC. I canceled the makurths game text, and missed my shot on xizor. I draw a 5 and 4 for my destiny, and everyone is cleared out of the site, including all of my guys. He spreads out at many docking bays with vigos and such, but menace fades is in effect, and his objective isn t flipped. I am draining for 5 while he is only draining for 1 a turn, and soon he gets down to about 10 cards. He deploys a vigo and 4-lom to come kill luke at the farm. I cut the vigo, but draw a 0. He draws a 0, so its me and 4-lom. I drain at the farm, he plays always thinking with your stomach, lukes stupid @#$% gets lost in the docking bay. I deploy several guys from my hand to go find luke, deploy threepio and artoo w/ chewie, fight 4-lom, make him lose him, and next turn I drain him out. <br/>
<br/>
FW 19 4(+46) <br/>
<br/>
Highs- Killing xizor on turn 2 <br/>
Lows- none <br/>
Ugly- Fairbanks losing 6 force to me fighting a lone xizor, when he takes no battle damage <br/>
<br/>
After game 3, I am very hungry so I walk down to the street to go to jimmy johns. On the way, I see these 3 chicks from my school, Kate, Dianna, Elizabeth, and Brittany, so I have to stop and talk. I kind of lose track of time, and I am about 10 minutes late for the next round&amp;#8230;Elizabeth was wearing really short shorts&amp;#8230;I had to stay long. Heh <br/>
<br/>
Game 4- My Huntdown Podracing vs. Keith browns RST <br/>
<br/>
Keith has a really good light side deck, but I have beaten It several times in the past, and was hoping to do so again. He starts off deploying corran horn to the holotheatre to cancel visage, and I respond by deploying mara to kill him. He gets crix and chewie of kashyyk to an endor site, and DLOTS w/stick come down and fight. I chop cracken, play sniper to make him immediately lost, draw a good destiny, and chewie goes bye-bye. Two turns later, Zuckuss in boat go to the endor system. He puts out Gold squad. 1, and tala 2 with pilots, but does not battle. I deploy Iggy w/gun to try to add a destiny, but I cant because zuckuss in boat doesn&amp;#8217;t count as being a bounty hunter to add to attrition. So I draw a 5, and I fly down to the back door to chill with vader. I win the podrace, and then he lands the falcon and plays covert landing. Luke and some other random scouts go to vader. I battle, try to cut luke, and miss. He cuts vader, so I try to duel. I win the duel, but he plays some tatooine card that says: If you just lost a duel, play this card, lost a force, and the duel is cancelled. So I am like F UCK, because that prolly would have been game. I draw destiny and clear the site. Vader makes another late appearance, and I drain him out. <br/>
<br/>
FW 9 6(+55) <br/>
Well, since we only had 8 people, we played only 4 games, because parings would have been too chaotic. I Matt takes first and a foil ben w/ stick, I take 2nd and a foil masterful move. Two other random foils are given out to Mike and Keith. <br/>
