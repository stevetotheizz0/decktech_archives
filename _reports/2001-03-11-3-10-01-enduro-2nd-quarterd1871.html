<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">For prior happenings, refer back to 3-10-01 ENDURO 1st Quarter, written by myself.<br/>
<br/>
During the break:<br/>
I loved the way my DS deck was working, and had a lot of fun with my weird RTP deck, so I decided to continue running them.  At 4pm, the 2nd Quarter began.<br/>
<br/>
The Tournament:<br/>
<br/>
My decks:<br/>
LS - All For Her - mains with insanely high destiny draws<br/>
DS - CPI Navy v3.0 - blow away every system on table, and lockdown the win with Ability, Ability, Ability<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS v. Steve Daniel’s AITC Speeders<br/>
Frickin’ tournament software; wtf?  I let him do his thing on Tatooine; I handled his drains with Strategic Reserves and undercover spies.  Yavin 4 w/ ADLR vaporized; 2 turns later Tatooine suffered the same fate.  His drains had tore into me prior, so I retrieved off my Navy Troopers and tracked my retrieved Arica.  I had lost Bespin and Endor (later retrieved) systems early thinking that he wasn’t packing any related, but was soon proven wrong to my dismay.  Endor got blown apart, and we had some throw-downs at the Downtown Plaza, where I made my mistake: I broke Arica’s cover so that she could be in a battle.  He dropped Lando w/ Ax, and after excluding her, cleaned house.  I had run out of non-uniques to use on Strategic Reserves ages ago.<br/>
Result: FL -19<br/>
Standing: 0(-19)<br/>
Good Things: Making him run out of options prior to my mistake.<br/>
Bad Things: The costly mistake involving Arica; how big of a scrub am I?<br/>
Compliment of opponent: Prediction of who would win went back and forth, and we played in a fun environment since he knew my deck pretty well and I knew most of his.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS v. Jason Henderson’s Hunt Down<br/>
8D8 never showed up (just to let you know, I started Seeking An Audience), even after a few How Did We Get Into This Mess?-s.  EPP Obi went out for the heck of it, and got dueled away.  Lando went alone to sack Visage, and got beat down hard.<br/>
Result: FL -29<br/>
Standing: 0(-48)<br/>
Good Things: None.<br/>
Bad Things: Scrubbing hard.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: Efficient, sinister, cruel, predictable, and was being played by many people that day.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS v. James Weldon’s TIGIH<br/>
Time to raise my pathetic self from Scrubland.  He’s dropping most of the Endor scouts to his sites.  Arica locked Luke down, while U-3PO and Strategic Reserves took most of the drain damage away.  I went to set up ADLR, but he dropped Obi to Endor to cancel it.  Endor got blasted, and AAA worked its magic.  After this setup, he tried to do some illegal moves thinking that he could, but I promptly quoted rules to him.  I went to drain at Yavin 4, which was still out after ADLR was cancelled, and nothing much happened after that.<br/>
Result: FW +25<br/>
Standing: 2(-23)<br/>
Good Things: Perfect.<br/>
Bad Things: Beating a scrub and having to explain rules to him.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: The deck looked strong, and vs. a different deck, probably would have done a little better.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS v. Glen Alexander’s SYCFA non-flip Star Destroyers<br/>
Still stuck in Scrubland.  Arica came down to the Detention Block Corridor first turn.  8D8 and 2 Lift Tubes came out my 2nd turn, freed Leia, and 3rd turn I flipped.  My mains took over the Death Star and Yavin 4, inflicting maximum damage, while he dropped junky Star Destroyers with pilots to systems.  Artoo Double Agent-ed Arica, freeing up the drain at Detention Block Corridor.  8D8 ran the Death Star Plans for 17, and Prisoner went On The Edge for another 5.  I won the drain race.<br/>
Result: FW +23<br/>
Standing: 4(0)<br/>
Good Things: Worked very well.<br/>
Bad Things: Beating a scrub.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: None.  He was very loud, counted everything off, and was a prick when I wanted to switch the EPP Han FOIL in my lost pile with the non-foil one I had on table.  My rationale was that I didn’t want a foil in my deck once I retrieved it, and he was spouting some incomprehensible stuff about persona replacement and how I’d have to lose Force to do it or something; I wasn’t paying attention because he was obsessing over it.<br/>
<br/>
2-2; not bad but not great.  I broke even, which alleviated my pain, but was still a little mad at myself over my performance.<br/>
<br/>
CONTINUED IN 3-10-01 ENDURO 3rd Quarter<br/>
