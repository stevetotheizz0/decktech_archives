<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">    Run by Charles Hickey, this was the last tournament before the release of Reflections II, so I wasn’t going to build new decks from scratch.  Hunt Down for Dark Side, and a modified Echo Strike Team for Light.  Took out any unpiloted fighters, Squadron Assignments, and any locations I couldn’t pull from the deck.  Added Strikeforce, Capital Support, Staging Areas, and upped the ship count to 11 with 70 power between them. <br/>
<br/>
  The ship selection was fun to work with, Staging Areas made the Mon Cals pretty good in a pure power deck, Masanya is a 5 power freebie, and the Green Squadron A-Wings were there to avoid a -2 from my own Combined Fleet Action and deploy for 1 at Sullust with EBO.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 1 - DS versus Denny Chapin’s Agents In The Court (Chadra-Fans)<br/>
<br/>
  Dropped Vader and his saber at the Trade Route first turn for a flip, Denny gets out Bo Shuda, Kabe, and Tessek at the Audience Chamber, and a Bargaining Table.  Tarkin backs up Vader, and Denny flips with Chadra-Fans and Obi.  I move to stop his drains and we have a battle or two before he deploys a Bothan Spy to the Holotheatre to cancel Visage.  <br/>
  He doesn’t have an Undercover, so the spy is left helpless there when Djas Puhr and IG-88 With Riot Gun hit him with battle destiny of 1 and 6, for 12 battle damage, and another couple rounds of drains does ends the game.  Win by 22.<br/>
<br/>
2(+22)<br/>
Highs: Interaction, a few battles.<br/>
Lows: Fairly uninteresting battles when one side is comprised of a mob of aliens.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 2 - LS versus Keegan Carlston’s Bring Him Before Me<br/>
<br/>
  Keegan gets the usual force generation setup, Mobilization Points, a system, and the Emperor at the DSII docking bay.  I go get my Echo sites and Staging Areas out.  He drops Mara and some forfeit fodder at the North Ridge, misses the saber pull, and moves under the shield.  Deploy Jedi Luke from the deck, Wedge and Elyhek Rue piloting Rogue 3, and battle.  Cancel his draw and the forfeit fodder, some Imperial, covers my attrition against him.  <br/>
<br/>
  He deploys Vader and moves over, capturing Luke, and moves the Emperor to the Throne Room, then loses 1 to his objective.  I set up EBO with some cheap Rebels and aliens, deploy the Independence overhead at the Hoth system, and shuttle up Wedge and Elyhek.  The next turn, take over Sullust with a Green Squadron A-Wing, Mon Cal Cruiser with Major Haash’n, and Masanya for a total of 7 force.  Keegan deploys a Lateral Damage, Major Haash’n cancels it on the spot.  He deploys some ships and passengers, anyway, and ends his turn.  Deploy a Cruiser and Spiral, battle, the battle damage ends the game.  Win by 34<br/>
<br/>
4(+56)<br/>
Highs: Major Haash’n is a such a great card.  <br/>
Lows: Stopping to battle on Hoth slowed me down a little, I could’ve and should’ve just concentrated on setting up EBO.  Still worked. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 3 - DS versus Joe Olson’s Agents In The Court (Palace Raiders)<br/>
<br/>
  First turn I drop Vader and his saber at the Trade Route.  It wasn’t a smart move in the first round, but I got away with it.  This time it bit me in the backside.  Get in a couple drains before the Sandwhirl hits, when it passes, I drop Tarkin and Mara, search, and I’m back in business, while he sets up Tessek and company at the Audience Chamber.  <br/>
<br/>
  Cancel his Bargaining Table once, he plays Transmission Terminated three times, one gets through.  He’s dropping sites, and they’re all either deserts or surrounded by deserts.  Get Mara’s saber and drain a couple more turns until he drops another Sandwhirl and spreads with Palace Raiders in Patrol Craft.  Hit him now and then to stop drains and take out Raiders, and whittle him down to 5 cards before he fires off a Nar Shadda Wind Chimes.  Loss by 10.<br/>
<br/>
4(+46)<br/>
Highs: Fought it down to 5 cards.<br/>
Lows: Showed the Hunt Down is approaching the service mileage.  And that I really needed to add some walkers or Controls for the Sandwhirls and a Secret Plans.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 4 - LS versus Peter Sundholm’s Monkey TIEs<br/>
<br/>
  Pete starts off with Set Your Course For Alderaan, gets Wakeelmui with Mobilization Points, while I get my Echo sites and Staging Areas.  He gets TIEs down early to Sullust, and to Hoth after I deploy it.  I take a hit at Sullust because I’d rather spend force on getting EBO set up.  But on my next turn, a Talz, Kal Fal, and Sgt. Bruckman at the Echo sites get EBO running, and Independence with General Calrissian piloting hits the TIE at Hoth.  He has a Ghhhk to stop the battle damage.<br/>
<br/>
  He gets me with another drain at Sullust and deploys Sienar Fleet Systems.  I get in a drain of 3 and drop Home One and Madine at Hoth, pull Chewbacca of Kashyyyk from the deck with Madine, shuttle up Kal Fal, move the Independence to Sullust to block the drain.  Pete deploys some more TIEs, battles, and plays All Power To Weapons.  Lando covers his attrition and the battle damage.  <br/>
<br/>
  Back up Independence with more pilots, a Green Squadron A-Wing, and Spiral, battle, and clear out the system when Pete doesn’t have an All Power To Weapons.  Move Home One to Wakeelmui to drive up the deploy cost on his TIEs.  Pete drops Lateral Damage, a Dreadnaught, and some TIEs against Home One and makes me forfeit Madine, Kal, and lose a couple more cards.  My draw and the +3 power from EBO helped take the edge off.  <br/>
<br/>
  Next turn, deploy Major Haash’n to cancel Lateral Damage, but the game is ended by the battle at Sullust, where I deploy another Mon Cal Cruiser,  Masanya, and a Green Squadron A-Wing, adding 17 power to the fleet there for 7 force.  Battle, he ends up with 26 battle damage after forfeiting his ships.  No Ghhhk this time.  Win by 17.<br/>
<br/>
6(+63)<br/>
Highs: Getting loads of power out.  Major Haash’n is still a great card, though the game ended before the fully repaired Home One saw a battle.<br/>
Lows: Seeing two or three Ghhhks.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 5 - LS versus Kyle Krueger’s Bring Him Before Me<br/>
<br/>
  Kyle gets the Emperor out to the Ewok Village and gets me for a couple drains of 2.  He drops Janus Greejatus and Overseeing It Personally with some guys at the Dark Forest to get in big drains, but Menace Fades and EBO are set up the next turn, with DSII Wedge and General Calrissian on Rogue 3 at the North Ridge, and a Mon Cal with Ackbar, Thaneespi, and Masanya at Hoth.  Ackbar pulls out Capital Support, so Kyle is losing 1 to the Admiral’s Order, plus drains at the Ridge and in space.  After he drops Vader and I deploy Jedi Luke to be taken into custody, he is also losing 1 to his objective.  <br/>
<br/>
  In space I get spread across Hoth and Endor, contemplating a strike with General Solo, EPP Leia, Chewbacca of Kashyyyk.  Since he has some weapons out, I replace Capital Support with Combined Fleet Action and search a couple turns in a row for a combat vehicle, but Rogue 1 is nowehere to be found.  Pity, with Combined Fleet Action, and orbiting fleet, and Han and Chewie in that speeder, I could lock out his draws at a site, track Capital Support for destiny, and take over.  Instead I stay in space and drain him out.  Win by 20.<br/>
<br/>
8(+83)<br/>
Highs: Solid setup in space, his deck was all drain modifiers, so Menace Fades shut him down.  Making him lose force to Capital Support.  <br/>
Lows: Focused on different sides of the atmosphere.  Could’ve been interactive, but there wasn’t much reason to go down there.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 6 - DS versus Zach Jones’ Profit<br/>
<br/>
  Mara and Mighty Jabba the Audience Chamber, Crush The Rebellion is one of my effects, Twilight Is Upon Me is one of his, so any battles involving Luke or Vader are likely to clear the site.  Get Mara’s saber on the first turn and draw.  Drop Vader on the second to flip.  I get away with sitting at the Audience Chamber with Senses to protect Visage for a few turns while he loses force.  <br/>
<br/>
  The Emperor joins his servants and the vile gangster before Zach dumps a bunch of mains down to battle.  Excludes Mara, misses the bounce on Jabba with Master Luke, Force Field cancels the swing on Vader.  I Have You Now gives me flips of 6, 1, 5, clearing out his side of the site.  But he plays Gift Of The Mentor and The Force Is Strong With This One, so I forfeit Vader and the Emperor.  Replace them both on my turn.<br/>
<br/>
  He has been pretty banged up by the time he gets Leia and Someone Who Loves You for the flip.  I’ve been tracking a 5 for Force Lightning when she shows up, but miscounted somehow and flip a 3 when I take the shot.  So she manages to free Han, and the game is dragged out.  Order To Engage and Narrow Escape make me lose force a couple times, but I get set up with a site between my characters to stop this combo.  <br/>
<br/>
  He’s got a good bit of SAC, so by keeping Obi-Wan or Luke down and my objective on the 0 side, he can stop my Senses.  By this point in the game, he has played all three of his grabbers, catching I Have You Now, Sense, and Monnok.<br/>
<br/>
  But he is falling behind on damage, getting me for 1-2 while I hit him for 4.  In a last battle, the Emperor and Sim Aloo with a tracked 6 and 4 destiny take out Luke and Obi-Wan.  Then he takes a couple rounds of drains and the game is finally over.  Win by 15.<br/>
<br/>
10(+98)<br/>
Highs: Lots of battles.<br/>
Lows: Should’ve been over with a lot sooner, but I messed up the lock by miscounting on the destiny tracking.  Also, Bring Him was all over the place, why weren’t the Profit decks paired against it and eliminated?  Oh, well.  Beats playing against alien swarm.<br/>
<br/>
  Joe Olson is undefeated and takes first place out of, I think, 18-20 players.  I’m in second place, 5-1, first tournament in a while where my Light deck outperformed the Dark.  Everybody stayed around to play casual games and talk about the new card spoilers, which is cool.  Too often the packs are torn open and everyone clears out before the wrappers hit the floor.     </font></td>
