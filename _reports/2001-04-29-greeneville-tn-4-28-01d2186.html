<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Here is my first attempt at a tournament report so here goes nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I am a twenty something guy who really loves Star Wars CCG but I do not have much time to play.  Sometimes in my spare time I put a deck together and go out looking for a game or two.  I was sitting at home putting together a BHBM deck and I decided to check out the action at the local comic shop.  When I got to B and C Comics and Collectibles I found out that a bunch of guys new to Star Wars CCG was trying to put together a tournament.  I have played in about six tournaments before and never finished higher then second at a sanctioned event.  One of the guys there had a labtop computer and had discovered Decipher tournament software about a month back.  He had became a tournament director and was running his first constructed deck tournament.  I have a rating of 1550 and I have not played for awhile.  Basically I am an avid player without time to play.  I work at an engineering firm and I put in a lot of overtime.  I constantly keep up with things on Decktech because I like the game and I want to keep up with all the new deck themes.  Most of the guys that were in the tournament have just started playing and most did not have any decks built that one would consider a theme deck.  Pretty much all the decks were put together with what ever they had to build them with.  They needed another player so I decided to play.  I knew I was probably better then most of them but I played anyway.  I figured at least I could teach them a small amount of knowledge that I have.  I realize I am not in the league of most of the better Star Wars players but I can hold my own.  <br/>
<br/>
The decks I had were an EBO deck and the BHBM deck I had built before I arrived.  The Ebo deck I had played before but I had never played a BHBM deck.  The BHBM deck was made to play with or without having to go after Luke.  The EBO deck was made to get a quick start.<br/>
<br/>
The first game I was matched up with a 16 to 17 year kid named Henry.  He is a pretty good kid and a quick learner.  I used my EBO/xwing deck against a deck that I guess was made for drains in space.  He had some mains but he maintained a large presence in space.  He started out with Endor and the effects needed to set up some kind of space force such as mobilization points, inconsequential loses and something special planned for them.  He started without an objective because he does not have many of them. He drew some cards and ended his turn.   I started out as with a normal EBO deck with the generators and marker 4.  In my hand I had a signal, echo corridor, Jedi Luke, Hoth system, Rogue 3 and a couple of other cards.  I figured the deck would go pretty quick with the signal.  I could pull a new secret base on the first turn and let the drains take place.  I searched for the new secret base and found out that both copies I had in my deck were both in the five cards in my force pile.  Bad luck right from the start.  Henry on the other hand had a great draw and had drawn several good card on his starting turn.  He deployed three planets and drew some more cards.  He had a pretty good force pile by his third turn.  For some reason having three signals, two new secret bases and many cards for the xwings was not helping me this game.  I could not get anything I needed to get start the way I wanted.  After about five or six turns and Henry building a pretty good I finally got a new secret base.  From there the game went pretty smoothly.  He gave me a much better game then I would have imagined.  This game may go down as one of the worst luck games I have ever played.  Nothing went right.  Luckily I won.<br/>
<br/>
1st game 2(+18)<br/>
<br/>
The next game I played was maybe the quickest game I have ever played.  With a BHBM deck playing against a person who does not have Luke in there deck, you can imagine what will happen.  The I was playing against, Brad, was playing a Tatooine deck using mostly aliens.  I know this guy is probably one of the better players in the group and I also knew he not just a kid that does not have many cards.  He pretty much has every card in the game.  Without a lot of boring explanation this game went quick.  I had the emperor at the throne room and vader on Tatooine after turn two.  Although he controlled Jabbas Palace I controlled the rest of Tatooine.  I was draining him for about 7 to 9 per turn including the loss for Your Destiny.  The game lasted about 20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
2nd game 4(+57)<br/>
<br/>
After the last game I realized that I was playing a group of guys that were in need of some to help them learn how to play.  I definitely consider myself a scrub, but these guys were even worse.  I really began to feel bad.  Both about not having better competition and two about beating these guys.  I realize the next time I played I would definitely try to find a better tournament.  The next guy I played was Sean.  He used a Dark side mains deck.  This game I got a good draw and setup my EBO/xwing deck on the second turn.  He drew some cards his first turn and I got just the cards I need to start my theme.  I had both Hoth Luke and Jedi Luke in my hand on the first turn.  I also had hobbie, zev, a new secret base and echo corridor.  First turn I pulled echo command center and echo docking bay.  I deployed zev and hobbie at the command center and docking bay respectively.  Sean deployed Tarkin and Veers on his second turn to docking bay 94.  My second turn I pulled echo base garrison and echo base garrison, deployed hoth luke which I immediately exchanged for Jedi Luke and setup echo base operations.  From there the game was pretty much over.  Sean did get Vader, Tarkin, Evazan and a walker with Veers over to Hoth but I just ran and let my xwings do there thing.  The drains were to much for him.<br/>
<br/>
3rd game 6(+83)<br/>
<br/>
It was about midnight and I really wanted to leave.  I knew I had already won the tournament.  I tried to talk the guys to only playing three rounds but they wanted a championship game. I played a final game with my BHBM deck.  I played Steven who is a pretty good player.  He was playing what I thought was a Tatooine deck.  He had done pretty good with it even though he did not have an objective.  As we started I noticed that my Imperial arrest order was gone.  Without it I could not pull my docking bays quickly.  I asked everyone if they knew where it was.  It was know where to be found.  I tried to borrow one but just my luck nobody had one.  I played anyway.  I had a very hard time getting my deck to work.  For some reason I could not pull Vader at all.  I had some early battles but it seemed that the pesky docking bays that I could not draw keep showing up at destiny time.   Steven was doing good getting some aliens down.  I seemed he was trying to set up the Harvest cycle but could not find the cards he needed.  After about 10 to 11 turns I finally pulled a Vader.  I have three in my deck and I was surprised it took me so long.  After pulling Vader I went to work getting to Luke.  Steven made two mistakes that cost him the game.  He took Luke and ran deep into Jabbas Palace and two he drew too many cards into his had looking for the Harvest cards he needed.  I really never figured out he overall game plan but whatever it was it did not work.  <br/>
<br/>
4th game 8(+107)<br/>
<br/>
After the game it was about one in the morning.  I got the first place prize which was several packs of special edition.  I felt pretty bad beating the guys I decided to give my prize to the guys that needed the cards.  I pulled several objectives and the guys were very happy getting them.  I told them since I was not doing anything on Sunday that I would come over and show them how to set the objectives up.  All the kids are very smart and in time I will probably be getting my butt kicked by all of them.<br/>
