<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This tournament follows the individual tournament that I won on Saturday. You can read my report on my own page...<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night, me and my team, &amp;#8217;The Four Musketeers&amp;#8217; (in reference of a mailing list in which we are) went to hotel for playtesting.  I didn’t want to play something new due to the lack of playtesting. I had met 2 opponents who started Ounee Ta yesterday but I even crushed them. So I wanted to keep my Ralltiir Ops. In Light Side, my ’WYS’ is huge but I added Ounne Ta against Ralltiir (me and Martin Falke were playing the objective yesterday...). All the team  will played these decks but my friend Jimmy Faelens wanted to play Agents of the Black Sun  (he starts with Presence of the force to immediatly flip and make lose 2 forces to your opponent :-)<br/>
<br/>
I went sleep at 3 a.m. with Jimmy Faelens and a ’Big Juicy :-)’ belgium friend. At 5 a.m., me and Jimmy went sleep in the corridor because our friend were snoring like a Formula One. The hotel director wake us at 9 a.m. by asking why we were sleeping outside of the chamber. We had lunch and went to the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
15 teams show up for this second day. All the same good players are there instead of Koen Meijssen who wasn’t there on Saturday but joined us on Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Game#1 Lightside against a netherlander guy ’Court’<br/>
I apply the first turn flip with cheap smugglers and he sets up in the Audience Chamber. I then deploy in space with Dash, Mirax and their boats. I add Battle Plan, Menace Fades and Tatooine Celebration. So I lose nothing and I drain a few. Since I don’t succeed to draw I’ll Take The leader, I don’t drain a lot on my 2 Tatooine Docking Bays. I have to go battle inside with his own First Strike to make him lose more. After a few battles on the ground, he evntually goes to space with Dengar in P1 and Bossk in HT but I only lose a high forfeit Wedge Antilles. I have to finish him with my small drains...<br/>
FW 2(+33)<br/>
<br/>
Fabien Jacques and Christophe Vandalem (the 2 other guys of my team) both win their game but Jimmy lose against Bastian Winkelhaus Darkside.<br/>
<br/>
Game#2 Darkside against Phat Piron ’Profit’<br/>
I start with Arica in the Audience Chamber and he starts with Ounne Ta. In a Profit deck Ounne Ta isn’t dangerous for my deck because Ben deploys only on Tatooine, Han is frozen and Luke is even expensive.<br/>
I activate a lot on my Docking Bay but Phat quickly deploys Corran Horn and Ben against Arica while Master Luke comes on Jabbas Palace. He then breaks cover of Mara... On the next turn, I flip carefully and move Arica in front of Luke. He releases Han but doesn’t drain due to my objective. He deploys Orrimarko, Taws Khaa and Lando w/Ax with Luke in front of Arica. He then battles and I lose 8 forces and Mara (with the 2 forces from orrimarko). I spread out on the ground with my 4 Ralltiir sites, the system and Carida. I also put Arnet + Tempest Scout 1 on Moss Eisley (he deployed it before). I was draining like a mad and I only lose 2 forces from his objective. So he comes in front of Arnet but I adds Vader in the Chamber to enhance my drains. I battle against him with Arnet and First Strike. I also go battle Han with Vader, Janus and then Sim Aloo to retrieve a few and make him lose more. I eventually kill Han but I outdrain him...<br/>
FW 4(+44)<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, Fabien and Christophe all win, sweat !<br/>
<br/>
Game#3 Lightside against Jan Willem Sipkes ’strange deck’<br/>
He starts with Jabbas Palace !?! He deploys Wakeelmui with Mob. Point and  Lord Vader on my Docking Bay to activate with the same effect.He also pulls off his Jabbas Palace sites. I put the other DB (generic) on Tatooine and flip with Palace Raider + Craft + another smuggler in front of Vader and one on the second DB. I battle, draw my destinies and he loses Vader and one more force. He then draws and I play Grimtash lost for 2 All Power To Weapon (he was playing Sienar). He sometimes deploys a guy on the ground but he puts a lot of Ties on Tatooine system (to give him power +7 in battle on sites). I beat them and spread to drain on Cantina, the 2 DB, Jabbas Palace, Audience Chamber and Lower Corridor. I cancel his lone drain with Bargaining Table in the beginning but I quickly win the drain race.<br/>
FW 6(+64)<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, Fabien and Christophe all win, sweat again ! I want to play Bastian Winkelhaus or Martin Falke. But Bastian also played Lightside and Fabien has more differential than me. So it’s Fabien that will play against Martin Falke. The second bad news is that the tournament is in only 4 games. This is due to the fact a lot of players come from far and need to leave early.<br/>
<br/>
Game#4 Darkside against a deutsch guy ’WYS’<br/>
No Ounne Ta so I will flip early. He choses not to flip but goes on Ralltiir System to prevent me from flipping. I easily prepare my sites with At-Sts and imperials on next turn and he doesn’t flip yet. So I put a Dreadnaught with a pilot in front of Dash and flip. I battle, he loses all and I lose the pilot. He doesn’t come on Ralltiir but sets up in Cantina and Kessel. I respond with Arica in Cantina and some ships. But he cleans me from space with Falcon and cannon. He eventually plays On The Edge twice (one from lost pile) but I stack the third. I clean the Cantina with Arica and his DB (Luke JK is here) with Vader Epp. My last ship flees his fleet and I initiate each time with First Strike and Projective Telepathy (I redraw it each turn with Janus). Search&amp;Destroy do is Job and my drains finish him (I am now on my 4 Ralltiir sites)...<br/>
FW 8(+84)<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy and Christophe win also but Fabien loses by 11 against Martin Falke. So we are first and the team of Bastian and Martin is second. We gain a full set of box toppers Ref 2, a lot of boosters and an Imperial Decree foil.<br/>
<br/>
So I have won the saturday individual event and my team has won the sunday team event. I have won my 10 official games in the week-end and I beat 3 Ounee Ta with my Ralltiir Ops. I will also post my decks.<br/>
