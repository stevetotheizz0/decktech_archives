<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">well, I slept 4 1/2 hours and was ready to go.  I added my LS dagobah rare to my HB/Tat mains deck, and added a shock to my huntdown deck because I saw plenty of Oolas.  I got up there around 8:30 because I was running the YJ event, and was hoping that we would have enough to sanction it.  We had 12, so it worked out great.  Nicholas Ferreri drove up that morning from the Atlantic City area(2 1/2 hours) for the 9am start.  I gave Scott Lingrell my decks so that we would have an even number, but he doesn't really play YJ(and no my decks don't completely suck, I blame Scott for them going 0-4).  Kevin Reitzel used the card that let Nute Gunray and Rune Haarko fight together, these were the Naboo versions with the added power gametext against Queens or handmaidens.  Combined with a weapon and the destiny he had power 22!  A bit of overkill, but definitely very cool.  Doug Faust won the even, Dan Bojanowski took 2nd.  Now on to SW.    There were just over 63 people at 11am, Bart Robinson dropped out to make it even.  At 11:40, 3 guys walked in and added in, so bart jumped back in.  After the 2nd game, one of the little kids dropped, so bart dropped out again.  I think he jumped back in once more when someone else dropped and created a bye, but I'm not sure.  Where am I going with this?  Bart is a good guy for doing this and he deserves some props.<br/>
<br/>
I played my HD deck and my Hb/tat mains/OMDH decks<br/>
We start around 11:15 because it takes a few extra minutes to get all the player info into the software and to make sure that everyone is registered before we hit the pair button.<br/>
Game 1 DS vs Doug Faust's(1819) Super Falcon deck<br/>
	Doug really liked Mike Dalton's deck, so he built it himself.  Doug and I were the first pairing called out, so we got to sit at the top table, someplace I was expecting to be near for most of the day.  With Dsgobah out I have enough force to drop Vader first turn, and I do so to the Endor Forest Clearing.  Visage works against doug.  He gets Yoda in opening hand, so he can't go down first turn.  Instead he pulls the hut and farmboy from reserve deck.  Vader gets his stick and starts draining for 3 while he still can.  Doug deploys Kessel and Captain Han in the Falcon.  I deploy Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and Cmd Nemet to kessel(sweet combo) and draw a 5. down goes the falcon.  his jedi testing isn't working yet, so vader is still draining for 3.  zuckuss gets the BUS for back-up, and then JT 1 works. doug started battle plan, but it really isn't hurting me.  I have a bunch of cards in hand and by the time I can track my reactor terminal, doug only has 2 cards left, which he has to lose to visage on my turn and at the end of his.  win by 5<br/>
2(+5)<br/>
highlights: taking down the falcon early<br/>
lowlights: having 13 cards in my hand that I wasn't able to put back<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 LS vs Aaron Kingery's(1847) Huntdown/Space/Tractor Beam deck<br/>
	he starts duel, and I think we are going to have a repeat of the charlie herren game from last night.  Then he deploys the Death Star docking bay and gets Vader to it quickly, but he put battle order out so I don't fear his drain.  I terminate visage and drop porkins in red 6 and tantive with Han and Melas to tatooine.  then he deploys Zuckuss in MH, but I barrier, and then I see the vengeance with a tractor beam.  I get the spiral out for backup and so I have plenty of ability.  I drop Ben Kenobi and saber on the ground at the 1 site I can find-Jabba's palace.  I battle and take out zuckuss.  he tractors tantive.  then he deploys Conquest, battles, but doesn't have enough ability to draw(ooops), so it dies.  his tractor beam missed.  I decide it's time to cut and run, drop an OMDH and orrimaarko and tawss to Mos Eisley and retrieve my lost ships. I drain on the ground for a while and he drains at my system.  I get my ships back out and take back the tatooine system-releasing my tantive.  That's all she wrote.   fw +32<br/>
4(+37)<br/>
Highlights: releasing the tantive 4<br/>
lowlights: getting the tantive 4 and red leader in Red 1 tractor beamed(especially since he got to use RL as his own)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 LS vs Steve Brentson's(2031) DS power deck<br/>
	This is a matchup I would have thought would happen later, but I'm feeling pretty good right now.  I'm 0-4 lifetime against Steve, but 2 of those were during Bespin &amp; beyond.  He drops the 5th marker and the defensive perimeter, i pull a system.  then he puts 2 guys at the 3rd marker. I deploy Tawss and battle, he draws a 2, I draw a 4, but IAO is out.  I lose tawss anyway to avoid beatdown(I'm starting to smarten up) He started the death star and is getting plenty of force, so he drops a blizzard walker with DS-61-2 in it at the 3rd marker.  I projection it and then draw some, then first card being boussh.  He drains, deploys another pilot to the walker and draws a few.  I drop ben Kenobi with saber to the cantina and boussh to block the drain all together.  He deploys a tempest scout with arnet and watts to mos eisley and vader to my jabba's palace. He keeps playing masterful move to look, and with oppressive enforcement out my senses are meaningless.  I bith shuffle after activating 1 to move the 6 around on him, but i know there are two more in there and a five, and 3 sites and 1 and 2.  I deploy melas to vader's site, deploy my dagobah rare card- WHAT IS THY BIDDING MY MASTER?- target vader, drop draw their fire, and battle.  he chokes melas with a 6. damn, almost worked, but the look on his face was memorable when I deployed the utinni effect.  he added Mara jade a walker for backup, especially since he monnoked and saw I had lost in the wilderness in hand.  I had about 10 cards in reserve deck(2 OMDHs and my signal).  I could not find anything to retrieve with and had nothing to let me go look.  The game spun away from me and I got outplayed at the end by a master.  loss by 12<br/>
4(+25)<br/>
highlights:using what is thy bidding, make brentson sweat a little<br/>
lowlights:melas getting choked, WITBMM not working, slowly getting outplayed and giving up my advantage little by little as my luck wasn't there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 DS vs Ray Bordier's (2033) HB deck<br/>
	Ray and I played game 1 RCon 1, and I won by 33(his only loss that day).  Ray lost his first game to Justin 'the giant killer' Pakes, but had won his next two.  This was the HB deck that he won PA states with, and I knew what it was and was going to have some trouble with it.  I would need an opening hand vader and to get visage working for a while if I was going to be able to win.  I look at my opening 8, and there's vader.  can't deploy him yet, so I pull a docking bay, see I have a ship in force pile and draw to it.  Then Ray terminated visage.  I had also drawn my 2nd visage, so I'm still feeling ok.  He pulls a system, deploys one from hand, and draws 2 or 3 cards.  I deploy an Endor site, drop vader and flip, and deploy 2nd visage.  he terminates. DAMN IT! There are two terminateds in his deck and he got them both in his first 10 cards.  I know right now it'll take a miracle to win, and i'm fresh out of them.  He gets space set up, I go fight a little with Zuckuss and Fett, he waits to flip so I can't probe.  He's got undercover spies on endor(boussh and tk-422), i get bubo out to the site they are both sitting at(the middle one, in case I split up).  Ray activates them all, deploys some ships and clears me out of space. he then starts moving around, I remind him that bubo attacks. He then says he's already in his move phase. I'm just like, 'whatever I'm gonna lose I'm not going to be a ba$tard about it' and then Ray pauses for a second, picks the two of them up and says 'Sorry, I shouldn't have acted like and a$$hole, it's a force of habit' or something like that. Bubo eats tk, damn I wanted boussh.  he drains me to death in space. lose by 18<br/>
highlights:nothing stands out<br/>
lowlights: two visages being cancelled in the first two turns.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 DS vs Jared Napolitano's (1651) Y4 mains deck<br/>
	After the last two losses I'm a little frustrated and not really in a great mood.  I was disappointed, hungry, and didn't feel like playing again so soon, since Ray and I went almost to the end.  However, I was feeling especially proud of the big dawg Ghetto leader since he was 4-0.  So I match up against jared and he starts y4 mains.  big surprise, he plays all 2/0 sites.  I use bubo to eat his nudjs and drop Vader to endor.  I put Mara in the hoth war room with her saber.  he send epp han and ecc lando to fight her, puts out aim high, I barrier han.  Then I drop Igar and battle so I can add a destiny.  swing at han 0,1.  draw a two 2's, so han dies, i lose igar.  he drops epp luke and another han(who knew he had both already) with lando, battles, cuts and then shoots anyway to add 5 to power.  I swing and hit han, he draw a 4 and 3.  I draw a 2.  I lose mara and like 18(someone who really cares can do the math).  how could I be that stupid?  Although, after reading someone else's report where they accused the guy of cheating I wonder a bit, but I don't think he did and I won't bad mouth him just cause i lost.  game was even after that but I was just too far behind.  DAMN IT!!!!!!<br/>
highlights:only losing by 12<br/>
lowlights:being stupid with mara, losing to this kid.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs Wojchiech Jankowski's (2002) Ominous Rumors Deck<br/>
	I was in a terrible mood after this game-just ask Mike Blythe who I sat next to in the lobby waiting for the other games to end. If I was a pu$$y I might have been on the verge of tears, but I'm not and this is only a friggin card game. Shit happens, just try not to eat too much of it.  Mike cheered me up a bit with his usual banter, and i laughed a little bit. Laughter cures the soul. Ok, i'm ready to go again.  So I go stand near the back of the room cause I figure that's where I'll be playing.  I'm expecting to play someone not quite top notch so I can break even like I always seem to do at these big events.  But I get to Woj.  We've been at a bunch of tournaments together, but up until states last month had never played.  He beat me then by 18.  He was 3-2, not having a great day either.  I get a bad start, he gets some ships out and Ominous set up with Vader at the docking bay and some guy inside the bunker.  There were a couple of Mallrats lines exchanged here. I say 'oh a ship' and woj goes 'It's a skooner' and then I go ' No you silly ba$tard its a sailboat' which made this the 2nd funniest game.  I deploy jeroen webb to the bunker and add tawss khaa, epp luke to the docking bay, and What is thy bidding vader(AGAIN!!!). Woj picks up the card, reads it, and then just starts laughing.  I battle in the bunker, make him lose the guy and 2 cards and retrieve with tawss.  then I battle vader, swing and draw 3,3.  draw destiny of 4.  perfect.  he loses 3 cards and I only have 1 force left.  Can't move luke into the bunker, and don't really want to leave tawss alone.  he only has a few in hand, so I get a little greedy I guess and leave luke alone.   20/20 hindsight says this wasn't a great idea.  mara and Blizzard 2 come down next turn and smack luke around.  then i try lost in the wilderness on vader, draw a site(third time this weekend that has happened). So the space battles begin and I can't hang with all the ships he has.  I put Yoda down, 'Mutha f&amp;*kin Yoda and @#$% ' and then OMDH, but it's not enough.  He's outdraining me, so defeat is inevitable.  FL -10<br/>
highlights:only losing to woj by 10, Mallrats lines<br/>
lowlights:WITBMM and Luke failing barely, lost in the wilderness failing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I finish 2-4, losing to 3 players rated over 2000 by a combined 40 cards.  Needless to say I was not very happy, but I really didn't give a damn by the time it was over.  <br/>
<br/>
props:<br/>
to Rich Haman for getting the results and getting the command cards in order quickly between rounds.<br/>

to Ghetto Squad for being who they truely are and showing everyone that they just have a bad rep because of 1 bad day.  TJ was definitely missed.  Hope everything works out well for you man and we see you at the Regional.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, that's not the end.  there is still some B-ball to be played and the sealed deck tournament.  As soon as the final confrontation starts, a whole group of us go outside to the basketball court.  Team Albany issued a challenge, and it's on.  Greg Hodur(ghetto leader), John Lolli(ODB-ghetto 22), Chris Praskac(ghetto ) and myself(not quite ghetto) take on Arthur Wright, Mike D'amboise, Pete Srodoski, and Aaron Kingery.  We won the 2 out of 3 series, but it was a great game.  I didn't play my best, but I was wearing jeans which didn't help.  We were getting killed on the boards(needed Pete Flamini, but it's volleyball season now), but Greg was raining them from downtown.  So now it's brutally hot, we're sweating are a$$ off, and the court lights haven't really kicked on making it impossible to see so John and I head back inside to the air conditioning.  An hour or so later the Booster draft sealed deck event starts. <br/>
Everyone got 2 premiere packs, 2 jabba's palace packs, and 1 cloud city pack.  Then 3 of the 6 people per draft group got another premiere pack and the other 3 got an extra JP pack. I'm DS.  I open the first premiere pack and the rare is......Darth Vader.  Great, now I know I'm going to lose.  I know what your all thinking, he got Vader what the hell is he talking about.  Vader is nothing special in a sealed deck event. Sure it's nice that he can drain by himself, but there are so many 5's and 6's floating around in everyone's deck that his immunity is meaning less.  His only redeeming attribute is that he adds 1 to each destiny, so if you track a 6 you make it a 7 and then they have to lose 4 scrubby aliens.  I also drafted Jabba the Hutt, Salacious Crumb and J'quille.  J'quille is sweet, but I only got to use him once.  The only ship I had was obsidian 7, but I had a Dark Manuevers, tallon roll, and a lone pilot.  I got a Rancor, but no Rancor pit to put him at-damn. So let's do a game report because no one really does those for sealed deck and I feel like making you read some more.  I lived it, you'll read it.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs Joe Giannelli's deck<br/>
	He starts civil disorder, activates and draws.  I deploy the entrance cavern and weequay there, cancel disorder.he activates and saves.  I deploy a quarren and tusken raider to mos eisley(my SL) and move the weequay over.  I don't have any characters left in hand, but do have obsidian 7 and all the space cards.  he deploys a guy to mos eisley and moves into the entrance cavern.  he deploys an x-wing to yavin 4 system.  I drain, drop obsidian 7 and tallon roll.  next turn, he deploys 6 aliens to the entrance cavern for free(read the LS game text on the ds version, this site came right out of the deck after that), drops the kessel system and a y-wing to it. He also had Princess Leia on CC with a Jedi Saber draining for 3 at my Chasm walkway. I lose the game shortly after as I can't stop his drain of 3 there and he uses it could be worse for all my drains.  lose by 12<br/>
highlights:Elising Vader to CC where Princess Leia with a jedi saber is draining.<br/>
lowlights:forgetting to play Weapon levitation to steal the saber.<br/>
<br/>
0(-12)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs Charlie Herren<br/>
	ding, round 4.  will he finally beat herren??  charlie has a bunch of trackable 5's he keeps playing and tracking, but they really don't help him.  I have my drain at mos eisley going with Vader, so he goes to the Yavin 4 system.  I deploy and tallon roll his x-wing.  He then drops a y-wing with proton torpedoes, but I barrier it.  I then activate back to the DM/Tallon roll, draw them both and take out the x-wing.  So scrubs come to the ground against vader and crumb, but he draws a 3 so only crumb dies(destiny card lost ahahahaha). He keeps using figrin dan, but eventually his high destinies are lost, and as soon as he loses with figrin he just draws his last 3 cards and ends the game.  Fw +12<br/>
2(0)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs Brian Kim<br/>
	I start the jundland wastes this time and get Jabba out there.  he projections the site and starts draining at mos eisley and DB 94.  I move jabba to mos eisley, next turn I drop Vader, crumb and J'quille to the DB.  Vader goes bye bye because of fallen portal and a tracked 5.  Crumb dies and j'quille moves to jabba.  next turn some aliens come down and ambush jabba and j'quille.  Then he starts playing Dune Sea Sabaac with a jawa.  I just had my drain in Space at yavin 4, which he ICBW and then played sabaac all the time, plus drained for 4 on the ground.  FL -7<br/>
2(-7)<br/>
<br/>
Props to Doug Faust for running a good event, we all had fun.<br/>
<br/>
I lose that game and then the people are peskering Scott because it's 2 am and he is suppose to be out.  We all thought he had the room til 4am, but apparently not.  So the tournament ends and we all help Scott clean up quick and get out the room.  I was a long, frustrating, but fun day.  I really want to play in the team tournament on Sunday, but I have a staff party for work that I have to go to.  I go back to Jay's house sleep a few hours, then get up and we drive back to Rutgers.  We get down there at around noon, the party starts at 1.  My roommate decided to throw a spur of the moment party saturday night.  The house wasn't in too bad of shape, but it caught me off-guard.  I go to take a shower and discover that someone yacked in the tub.  I think I'll end on that note.<br/>
