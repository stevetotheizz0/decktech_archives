<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The world has experienced a new Pearl Harbor the Twin Towers (World Trade Center) were destroyed in a terrorist attack on the United States. The towers were destroyed when two planes crashed one into each tower. September 11, a date already stuck in my memory forever now has a second horror to remember. For the second year in a row, i have seen death.<br/>
9/11/01   UNITED WE STAND<br/>
<br/>
So Saturday rolls around, and i am gettin ready to go pick up Mot and derek for the tourney. As i go to leave and pick them up, what do i find? Nothing thats right, nothing no car to drive. My mom has seemingly disappeared with the car, so i am pretty fu&lt;ked. I call my boy dan and tell him to stall Brad and the tourney as much as he can. I dont know what he did or if he did anything, but it worked. I ended up driving a uninspected unregestered car to the tourney, not to mention the car is falling apart.<br/>
<br/>
So we start and first round i get paired with Brian Zinn,<br/>
ROUND ONE:<br/>
MY Dark i guess you could call it SYCFA Mains??? vs. Brians Mains starting the Throne Room (Y4) and three effects (none of which was insurrection???)<br/>
Well this game lasted some time, neither one of us wanted to make the first move. So what i did was set up my activation while waiting for him to make his move. I got out my sites and system, which he revolved the system and DS War Room (yeah i am a idiot, next time ill take the picture of Lita out of the sleeve and read the objective). Well he does make the first move, and drops Qui-Gon with saber and Lando w/ vibro ax to Jabbas Palace. He sits there and drains for a few turns, until U-3PO comes out. Meanwhile i started a small squad right next door at the audience chamber and was draining there. Here it comes, he makes a mad dash for the death star in an attemp to find another place to drain. This was the game winning move, well for me it was. He threw down Jedi Luke with saber down with Phylo Gandish to my docking bay. Well if there were ever a time in a game to smile that was it for me. My turn i drop Vader with saber, and Aurra Sing. Battle and here it comes, swing and hit Luke dark strike and hes gone. By the way Aurra steals Lukes saber and hits Phylo, he draws a zero and i draw a six. That was pretty much the game. Full win by some number?<br/>
<br/>
Next round pairings are up, and well sorry Brian you get to play me again,<br/>
ROUND TWO:<br/>
MY PoDpRoFiT vs. Brians Maul madness Mains<br/>
Well this game Brian wasnt so lucky. The amounts of retrieval was just too much for him. Nothing major happened in the game, profit flipped maybe a total of twice the hole game. Maul was placed out of play early in the game, thanks to a lucky OOC&amp;TT draw. Everytime Han was loose on the table DVDLOTS choked him off during a battle. So i didnt drain really all game. The game seemingly was headed nowhere. With Obi with saber out at a site and Master Qui-Gon with saber out at a site, there was just nothing for me to do. It appeared that i was going to be awarded a timed win over Brian. But then in a attempt to drain me, he drops Empy and Galid to the audience chamber joining 4-lom with gun. Oh happy day, something for me to do. My final turn of the game consisted of this. Activate, nabrun leids Master Qui-Gon to the audience chamber, playing Ive Got A Bad Feeling About This and battleing, clashing emperor, hitting 4-lom, and drawing a 7 for destiny. Not bad for a game winning one turn what do you think? Full win, and now i am  4(+??)<br/>
<br/>
Third round pairings come up and just my luck, Derek. Well sorry Derek, heres the thing Derek hasnt play star wars since Evercrack came out. Ever since all he does is play that dam computer game. So when i got him to play in the tourney, the deal was he would play so long as i made him decks. And i did, i saw this MWYHL direct damage deck on decktech and said that would be perfect for him. He had no problem playing it, until he played me,<br/>
ROUND THREE:<br/>
MY dark SYCFA Mains vs. Dereks MWYHL direct damage<br/>
Can you say unfair advantage? I knew you could, well considering i knew the deck card for card i knew what to look for. So once i saw one Obi/Luke with saber hit the lost pile, and his two Jedis Resilience hit the lost pile i had no fear. All i had to worry about was one more Obi/Luke, that and the falcon draining me at kessel when he put it out (which never happened), and maybe his retrieval. The retrieval i took care of when i played Come Here You Big Coward and Secret Plans. and drained at my sites and my one system (with Zuckuss in Mist and Bossk in Bus, this is important comes into play later in the game). He never sees the other Luke or Obi, and in a desperate attemp to kill something. He drops the falcon with Han and Horn, battles and finds out just how gay a card (set for stun) is. Bye bye Han, and good bye game. I draw my destiny, oh look 6 and a 4... The game ended a few turns later, it was just unfair because i knew the deck card for card. So i was enabled to prepare before the game what i was going to do. Full win, now i am 6(+??)<br/>
<br/>
Well after a long (hour+) wait, the final pairings are made. And to my surprise i am not playing the only other undefeated player, but instead Chris Wo@#$%a,<br/>
ROUND FOUR:<br/>
MY PoDpRoFiT vs. Chris and his Tie Swarm<br/>
Well, i have seen and played this deck before. So yet another game where i had a unfair advantage. I start Battle Plan rather than Goo Nee Tay, in a effor to slow him down a bit. It worked rather well, every turn he had to decide either drain or deploy something. So i set up rather quickly Han/Boushh/Lando for the easy ping (and didnt have to pay for the pings unlike the drains). Luke was sent up in the sky in his ship. Wasnt all that much help, stuck around for two battles after which he sat in his ship doin nothing in the sky. Only other time he came into play was during late game, to add a fourth ping and allow me to drain without paying. Between a combination of the podrace/pings/and the ever so small drains Chris couldnt do much. With my retrieval added into the equation he didnt really stand much of a chance. And another boring drain race game ended. Full win and i finish 8(+??)<br/>
