<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">  Another of the few oppritunities I get to be in tournaments while here at home, and for the second week in a row the tournament hosted about 18-20 people.  This is a marked improvement from the once normal 8-10.  Today I am running my Bring Him Before Me(BHBM) and my improved Mind What You Have Learned/Squadron Assignments (MWYHL/SA) the cards I need to finish my two new ideas are all at my appartment in Tuscaloosa...  unfortunate.  On to the action.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  my BHBM vs Brian's Mind What You Have Learned.<br/>
<br/>
  An Interesting game to say the least, as the new DS objective seems to roll over and die agianst a half decent Mind deck about 75-80% of the time, so I know I am in for a strugle.  I make my usual start with Secret Plans, Imp Decree and IAO, Brian starts a rather standard Mind start with Wise Advice, The Way Of Things and Twilight Is Upon Me.  I get going fairly quickly with a rather strong opening hand including Lord Vader one of the docking bays and Vader's Saber.  It didn't help brian that he actually FAILED test 1 the first time through.  By my third turn I had massive activation and had Mara, Veers in Blizzard 1(who TIED in the ONLY battle of the game, emperor's Power drew two 1's) and Lord Vader all on the table.  I am about to drain for a few(test 1 and 2 completed) when Lord Vader got lost in the wilderness.  I move Mara over with DB transit and find Lord Vader with a 6... the rest of the game is drains and I am a little ahead in that race.  Brian got ready to move his strike party to Endor via the docking bays, but lacked the force to make it work.  I drian and Your Destiny him to death with a small differental, but I escaped from Mind.  Full win by seven.<br/>
<br/>
FW (2)  +7<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating a Mind deck with a BHBM.<br/>
<br/>
Lows:  Having Lord Vader go for a stroll in the woods, cost me 6 in differential.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  My MWYHL/SA vs Mitch's JP alien deck<br/>
<br/>
  It took me long enough to get both Test 1 and the Training Area out in this game, but after a slow start, mind was up and steamrolling again.  Unfortunately for Mitch, he had a rather slow start, and that meant a large activation advantage for me.  Once I found Test 1 (took untill 3rd turn to deploy) I had a 14 ready as training destiny BEFORE drawing...  so it never really takes much to accomplish the tests.  I had a couple of drain blockers up and running by the time he got ready to drain for the second time.  I went and battled a couple of times...  didn't matter much.  Mind was way too strong, and it took forever.  Timed win by 29(although he had only 8 cards left).<br/>
<br/>
TW (3)  +36<br/>
<br/>
Highs: winning by 29... differental is good.<br/>
<br/>
Lows:  winning a timed game by 29, feels somehow unfinished and losing a timed game SUCKS(did that last week)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so at the turn I am undefeated along with several others, but at +36 I am not one of the top 3 at this point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  My BHBM vs. Robert's Hidden Base.<br/>
<br/>
  Normally these games are easy.  Normally you don't get handed Luke Skywalker(premier) on the 2nd turn Vader is on the table.  While Lord Vader and Luke are dueling every turn(with Vader winning almost every time) I am spreading out as much as I can to increase my drain potential.  I keep losing systems from my hand to cover his drains of one or two a turn and waiting for the objective to flip.  When It finally does I have my space fleet ready to go probing (he flipped early I think, drains on the ground were starting to add up).  I found his hidden base after a few turns and that proves to be the gamebreaker as the dark side eeks out my third victory of the day by 11 force.<br/>
<br/>
FW (5) +47<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Finding the hidden base to break the game open.  Keeping Luke in my posession almost the whole game.<br/>
<br/>
Lows:  Only one battle(which I did win) but no real chance to turn Luke.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  My MWYHL/SA vs Jonathan(?)'s TDIGWATT troopers deck<br/>
<br/>
  Hmm....  and obvious trooper assault deck and I get the tests done REAL fast.  I had all 5 Dagobah sites deployed by 2nd turn, 2 from opening hand, one for text, one drawn at end of turn one, another from text.  Needless to say that with a destiny of 15 before anything is drawn I laughed when I drew two locations and passed the first test.  Electrobinocs found me General Calrissian while I had Nein Numb in hand.  Gold One and admiral's orders came out on the same turn...  nothing went wrong for the Light Side this game.  No real intereaction as tracked 7's and OTE kept my lost pile to near zero the whole game...  I flipped with a 7 and put out Battle Plan...  by then the drains of 8 a turn (not bad for 3 systems) that I had locked down were overwhealming him and he had to pay 12 force a turn to drain for four drains of one.  With OTE and Reflection on Leia.. who was sitting happily at the Bespin system aboard Gold One I won this game with no cards in my lost pile and none in the hand either.  I also deployed almost nothing extra this game.  Full win by 33.<br/>
<br/>
FW (7) +80<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  NO CARDS IN HAND OR LOST at the end of the game<br/>
<br/>
Lows:  Steamrolling someone this badly, no interaction whatsoever...  He had to have left the game feeling frustrated and rather useless...  I've had days like that and they really suck.  I don't like giving out this kind of pounding.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  That wraps it up for the day.. I am undefeated and second place again.  Congrats to our winner... although I still wish we could get some showdown games in these tournaments.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you in the Tuscaloosa area, I am a tournament director.  I hope to be having rather regular tournaments in the area throughout this year.  Keep checking Decipher's tournament board for listings and I will try to get some tournaments up and running there as often as possible.<br/>

May the Force be with you. </font></td>
