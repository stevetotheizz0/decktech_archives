<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This tournement was bassicaly a Joke, not neccisarily for me, but for one of my freinds. The computer pairings were so bogus and messed it, he got screwed royaly. He had to play the top 3 players each in a row, even though he hadn’t won any games yet. but oh well, on to my games:<br/>
GAME 1- Me light him dark<br/>
Ok, This was an Easy Game. I was playing my TIGIH elom beatdown, and he was playing huntdown. He puts DLOS at hoth defense perimiter, I revolution that site, and med. chamber. I cancle visage with a bothan my frisst turm, and by turn 4 I drop about 7 eloms with EEP obi and smack down vader<br/>
FW +26<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2-Me dark HIm Light<br/>
I had to play my very good freind Cullen Burns this game. I had been at his house the night before, so I knew how good his deck was. I Had ralltiir, he had Liberation and speeders. He crushed me with force drains.. simple<br/>
FL -23<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3- Me dark, him light<br/>
This game was tough. I had ralltiir again and he had HIdden Base. I filpped second turn, then just used Executor and dengar running around killing x-wings with help of security precatuions.<br/>
FW +7<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4-Me light him dark<br/>
I had the TIGIH, he was playing the new DS JPSD obkective. I just smacked him down with Jedi luke and EPP obi. Not a hard game at all<br/>
FW +31<br/>
<br/>
GAME 5- Me dark him light<br/>
This also was a tough matchup. I had my ralltiir, he had EBO baraguins. I started Iperial Decree and secret plans, and just incaded hoth. ididnt even bother with my objective. I made shure to control 2 sites, so he only drained me at the most 4. I drained him for about 6 on hoth with lightsabers and Presence of the force. Then iwent to space with Zukkus and Bossk and wrecked. but it was very close game<br/>
FW +3<br/>
<br/>
Game 6- me light him dark<br/>
This was cheap. I should have won, but I just wasn’t playing smart at all! He had court, I had TIGIH. I put too many guys at one site, and he got out mossep and Galid and I begame losing about 6 off the top every one of his turns. Then he smacked Jedi Luke with DIsarmed and uded Dr.EVason to Operate, BY BY LUKE! that was pretty much game right there.<br/>
FL -16<br/>
I ended up geting 5th, only behind third place by +17 diferential.<br/>
Overall it was an OK tournement. Prizes were DS:2 and Cloud city packs. </font></td>
