<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The turnout for this weeks tournament was about what I expected. VERY LOW. The reason is b/c last weeks was states. I figured most people would want a week off after the grueling competition. Also, being a college town, most students have a major paper or project coming up and can't afford to spend the 4 hours need to play in a tournament. Well, whatever the reasons, the turnout was one of my lowests yet- 9 people. Oh well... We still had some great competition there, including two 2000+ players. Here is teh final standings, complete with rating and decks used<br/>

Game 1 Highlights<br/>
-Ben Fox-McCord's Droid/odds vs. Marlin White's Hunt Down- Ben is playing odds off of droids, while Marlin has a Hunt Down deck geared towards Hoth. Marlin plays Vader, Tarkin and Ozzel. Losing 12 force for each odds, hurts. That coupled with Ben's It Could Be Worses on all drains, and the canceling of Visage, puts Ben over by 17.<br/>
-Brandon Ruck's Hunt Down vs. Ben Blanton's Profit- Brandon is rating above 2000, while Ben is a beginner. It should be no surprise that Brandon wins. Brandon beats him through battling. Ben can't get anything going. Brandon wins by 37.<br/>
-John Camp's manipulator vs. Craig's Hidden Base- John sets up his drains, while scanning crewing and Dangerous timing Craig to death. Even though Craig was playing Hidden Base, the drains and manipulation early slowed him down, and eventually Craig couldn't do anything. John by 24.<br/>
-Rob Schenk's Court vs. Josh William's Profit- Josh gets an early jump on Rob's characters. Once Josh flips, he drains for what he can. Eventually Han gets killed, preventing Josh from draining. He relies on battling and pulls this one out. Josh by 25.<br/>
-Jason got the bye.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Highlights<br/>
-Jason Hasis's Profit vs. Craig's Court deck- Jason and Craig battle back in forth early. Craig actually has the advantage. He Trap Doors Luke into the Rancor Pit. Luke luckily draws high enough destiny to live. The next turn Ben joins him, as they slay the Rancor. A few turns later they free Han, and batlle Craig to death. Jason by 23.<br/>
-Ben Fox-McCord's space odds vs. John Camp's speeder ops- Ben is playing odds off Trooper Gaurds played on Star Destroyers. John is playing speeder ops on Clak'Dor. Ben starts Bright Center, which pretty much dooms John. Bright Center stays into effect until a turn or two before the end of the game. Odds and space drains early, help Ben. John flips and drains for 1 as much as he can, but in the end, its not enough. Ben wins by 6.<br/>
-Brandon's Yavin 4 mains vs. Josh William's Hunt Down- Josh disarms Luke early, and then duels him with Mara. Luke is crossed, and Jason loses. Obi Wan is then dueled promptly off, as well. Brandon runs out of characters and cards due to drains. Josh pulls off a surprising win by 5.<br/>
-Marlin's Tatooine mains vs. Ben Blanton's Court deck- Marlins sits and drains early, while Ben does the same. Ben spreads out to drain, while Marlin Nabruns over to defeath Klatu and some other scrub. Marlin battles Ben to death and wins by 24.<br/>
-Rob Schenk got the bye. After this game Ben dropped, so there are no more byes for that reason.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Highlights<br/>
-Jason's Huntdown vs. Brandon's Yavin 4 mains- Jason defeats this deck almost the same way Josh did. He duels the deck the same way. Luke gets crossed relatively early. Meanwhile, Vader's cronies are draining and battling Brandon's characters. Jason actually uses 'I Find you Lack of Faith Disturbing' on Vader against Twass Khaa, causing some nasty force loss. Then, late game Obi gets Circled. Jason wins by 16.<br/>
-Ben Fox-McCord's odds vs. Josh's Hunt Down- The droids get out early and pummel Josh with Odds. Josh cannot get his Tortures to cancel them. Since Josh is playing dueling, he doesn't have many sites or characters, and so his drains get 'It Could Be Worse'ed easily. Ben by 21.<br/>
-John's manip vs. Marlin's mains on Tat.- John's manip is geared towards killing mains by using Scanning Crew and A Dangerous Time, etc. He does just that to Marlin's deck. Marlin cannot get his characters out early enough to battle John's. John by 28.<br/>
-Rob's Court vs. Craig's Hidden Base- Rob stays on Tatooine and tries to drain. Craig stays in space and cancels drains and drains himself. Craig's canceling and more drains allows him to prevail in a very non-interactive game. Craig by 15.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Highlights<br/>
-Rob's Hidden Base vs. Craig's Court deck- This game is next to identical to the one they just played, only opposite sides. Even the outcome was the same. Hidden base wins. Rob by 15.<br/>
-Jason's Profit vs. Ben's space odds- Jason flips REALLY early. He is also playing Odds protection. Jason drains for 4 on the second turn, and then 10 on the second. Ben simply cannot insert enough and frequently to keep up. Jason wins by 25.<br/>
-Brandon's Hunt Down vs. John's Speeder Ops- Vader and crew invade John's planet, and battle him to a slow and painful death. John flips, but the gets it flipped right back. Brandon by 20.<br/>
-Marlin's Hunt Down vs. Josh's Huntdown- Marlin flips and deplots en masse to the Audience Chamber. Josh cannot free Han at all. Marlin pulls of the big win just by battling all those who try to free Han. Marlin by 40.<br/>
<br/>
All in all a good tournament. Jason won, as he almost ALWAYS does, and Brandon took a BIG hit (losing to a 1550 player and Jason.)Also, Ben came in second playing PURE cheese on both sides. Oh well... Overall it was a very good tournament. </font></td>
