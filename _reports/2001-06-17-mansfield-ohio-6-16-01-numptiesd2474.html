<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-tourney]<br/>
<br/>
So after the last tournament at Silverking Comics we were supposed to have a tournament at Comic Town and one at British Papermill. Both of those came up short of sanctioned. It seems no one has been around to play, lots of people busy. Then Ramapo comes around and the TDs go there so another weekend goes by without a tournament. Yet again on the 16th the TDs say there will be no tournament. I put off work on the 16th for nothing..... So around Thursday or so I’m talking to Ken Cross and see if he wants to make the trip up to one of Mansfield’s tournaments cause it will most likely be out last tournament before Origins. I was fiddling with my Hash Pipe deck (SYCFA Destroyer beats) and had already had a Slave Quarters - Tosche Mains deck I had been tweaking for a while. So I get online and I’m talking to Hayes Hunter about what dark I should play. He suggests ISB Space. I had never made an ISB deck before...ever. So I go take a look at some of the ISB decks on Decktech. The one I seemed to favor was Brian Hunter’s R. Rex deck. I made some adjustments and meta changes and was set. The drive up was pretty quick. We hauled about 80 - 85 the whole time so whatever. We get there and 2 other Columbus guys show up - Brian Sykes and Justin Danenbergs. We waited for Jamie Abel but he never showed. Patterson couldn’t play because of some real estate crap or whatever. Anyway, tourney time.<br/>

Game 1 - Light vs. Don Collins’ [1441] TDIGWATT<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the light details but this game was vague and I was just waking up. My GL in G1 and Landing Claw stop his drain in the sky and every time he deployed something I would beat it down. Drains did him in with my retrieving with On The Edge - Naked 3PO is a god.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 36<br/>
<br/>
2 (+36)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - Dark vs. Ray Smith’s [1482] RST<br/>
<br/>
I start Coruscant system, IAO, Mobilization Points, and DoDN/WA. He starts his RST stuff, Strike Planning, Aim High, and The Shield Is Down. I deploy Kessel from hand, Imperial Command for Piett and drop him at the Executor docking bay. He deploys Madine, CoK, and Wuta...hey, what a surprise. Next turn Piett comes out along with Fondor. Ozzel and Devastator to Kessel and an ORS. He’s stocking Endor Scout Troopers and scouts at the Landing Site but isn’t draining because of U-3PO. He finally blows up the bunker but my drains in space are too much for him and Battle Order is starting to hurt for him. He’s got Madine and Wuta at Chirpa’s Hut so down comes an ORS, EPP Vader, and GMT come to down to meet them. I battle and he tries to play End of A Reign on Vader but it’s not a just so it has to wait for the weapons phase. I slice Madine and cancel his destiny. He has to lose Madine, Wuta, and about 7 more. I squeeze off a drain of 3 at the hut for a turn and then he moves in. I move out (duh) and I’m no longer paying for Battle Order. That’s game. Aim High stopped me from retrieving a couple of times. Couldn’t get the Ornament when I wanted it.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 10<br/>
<br/>
4 (+46)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After the 1st round I am the top player along with Justin Danenbergs right behind me.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - Light vs. Justin Danenbergs’ [1826] TDIGWATT<br/>
<br/>
I swear, everyone was playing TDIGWATT. I saw at least 4 people using it. Anyway, I do my start and have Qui Gon at Tosche with Shmi while Naked 3PO is at Slave Quarters playing with himself. 4th turn he drops Emperor and Janus to CC Docking bay and Vader a site over, deploys Occupation, and moves over Vader. I was activating 19 since my second turn so force and tracking wasn’t exactly hard. I deploy Jedi Luke with Stick, EPP Han, and Chewbacca, Protector to the docking bay, drop Draw Their Fire, and battle. Now he can’t play his Weapon Levitation. Slice Vader with a 5 and a 4. Cancel Janus’ text for @#$%s and giggles and draw two destinies consisting of 4 and 3. He drew a 1. It was like my 24 to his 14, not to sure. He’s starting to drain in space and is followed by GL in G1 with a Claw who gets a Homing Beacon a turn later so I land at the docking bay. Game is getting close and his drains in space and Occupation is starting to ping me. I On the Edge twice and he deploys Vader who are met by Orrimarko and Corran Horn, I lose the battle by 1 and Corran goes to the Bacta Tank. Maul comes down with saber to beat but gets taken out with a 6 destiny. End game I deploy Cantina with Ben with his saber and EJP Lando to clinch the game, Chewie is sitting at the docking bay to block the drain. He battles Chewie and I Houjix. Drains do him in next turn. Good game!<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 10<br/>
<br/>
6 (+56)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - Dark vs. Ken Cross’ [1564] Tatooine Mains<br/>
<br/>
This game was pretty uneventful. He starts Slave Quarters and uses HFTMF to get Strike Planning, Menace Fades, and Don’t Do That Again. I get a pretty good hand with Kessel right off the bat. Merrejk goes to Exec docking bay 1st turn and pulls Fondor. Jar Jar shows up and ruins his day but I later draw the rest of my systems. I monnok to see what he’s got and start with some space drains. He’s not draining at all on Tatooine, he’s just sitting at the Slave Q. He deploys Cantina, Mos Eisley, and Lars Farm. Deploys Owen and Beru and moves over there. He tries to come to space with Liberty. Gets beat up. Captain Han and Harc Seff in the Falcon, loses Han. Harc gets beat up and he Houjixes. He tries to Harvest and I grab it. Qui Gon and Ben and his saber goto Cantina. ORS, Vader, and Tarkin come to meet them, I mistracked and missed Ben but drew a 5 for destiny. What got me was he forfeited Qui Gon and DID NOT REVIVE HIM. I move over to OutSkirts to drain more cause I don’t really care about the Cantina. -1 to drains and I’m still retrieving agents. My space drains do him in.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 29<br/>
<br/>
8 (+85)<br/>
<br/>
Well, being to only other good player there Danenbergs has fully recovered from his loss to be behind me again in the pairings so, off we go then. I’m like 4-0 against Justin right now and he’s pretty determined to break his bad streak against me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 -  Dark vs. Justin Danenbergs’ [1826] Tosche Mains<br/>
<br/>
Justin and I were discussing his light deck after game 3 and he showed my he was using Obi’s Hut and Tosche, I advised him about the Slave Quarters and pulling Shmi/Naked 3PO. He showed me he had already had the Slave Q in there because of the sick B’omarr Monk/DoS drains. We start off and again Merrejk goes to Exec docking bay. Pull Fondor and deploy Kessel from hand. He follows on his turn with Corran Horn and Padme to beat Merrejk up but I Ghhhk the damage away. I had drawn up the rest of systems during that last turn so I let them loose and deploy Devastator with ShnOzzel and Chiraneu on it to start draining. He’s getting mains and sabers on Tatooine and is followed by U 3PO, and I can’t find my 5D6-RA-7 to help stop some drains. I get vengeful which led me to my mistake - EPP Vader and Blizzard 2 go to Executor docking bay to beat on Corran and Padme. Mistrack again and miss Corran. Draw a 3 for destiny but Padme covers it all and I have to lose the Walker. Next turn he follows with another Padme and she pulls Qui Gon who is met by his stick. He misses Vader and I hit Padme and draw a 1 for destiny, woo hoo. I have to lose Vader and like 6. Now it comes down to a drain race, I’m draining for a bunch in space while he’s got Luke with saber and someone at Tosche, Daughter and Monk at the Quarters and Ben and Mirax in the Cantina. I drop 2 ORS, Godherdt, and Thrawn to the Quarters and battle, I lose  Godherdt and he loses the Monk. Next down comes Han and battles. It came down to a drain race where he squeezed it out from me.<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss by 13<br/>
<br/>
8 (+72)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I’m still in the #1 spot and Justin is still 6 differential behind me but we can’t play again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 - Light vs. Ray Smith’s [1482] Court something...<br/>
<br/>
Well, Court decks....Qui Gon kind of....makes them his @#$%. I do my start, 1st turn I have Ben, his saber, and Shmi at Tosche. He deploys Aurra Sing to AC and puts Quietly Observing on her and moves her over. I drop Cantina next to his Dbay and Outskirts next to Aurra to slow her for a turn. She’s joined by Mara and Bossk with Mortar Gun. I deploy Jedi Luke and his saber into the Cantina with EPP Han. He deplosy Maul with sitck and moves the crew over to Tosche. I activate a bunch, drain 3, Nabrun over Luke and Han, deploy EPP Leia, EJP Lando, and Qui Gon and his saber. Weapon Levitate Obi’s saber back (Aurra stole it the turn before), Slice Maul with two 5’s, he misses Ben, slice Mara with a 4 and 3, try to exclude Bossk and miss, miss Jodo with a gun (didn’t slice with Qui Gon, I was running low on cards in reserve) and he tries to use Bossks mortar gun but I play Too Close For Comfort and he can’t pay. Smoke Screen a 7, draw a 2, 5 and 6, Jodo cancels the 6. He loses everything and Lando goes to the Tank. He draws up before I can play my On The Edges.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 34<br/>
<br/>
10 (+104)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Justin would have needed to win by 41 cards with his TDIGWATT but he kinda started and pulled alot of cards in the beginning so I win and get a Sense foil and 2 packs of Tatooine. Woohoo. Here are the final standings (1-5), props, and slops.<br/>
