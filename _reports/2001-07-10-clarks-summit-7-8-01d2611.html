My decks:  DS Court with Palpy and friends and LS HBX Swarm.<br/>
<br/>
Game #1:<br/>
<br/>
My DS Court vs. Jesse’s MBO <br/>
<br/>
Jesse seemed like a new player, which is pretty cool.  I like seeing the young guys getting involved.  My first tip-off was when he started Goo Nee Tay and Crash Site Memorial with HFTMF.  (Yes, I know you CAN’T start these, and I pointed this out to him, and explained why.  But I let him start with them anyway, being the good sport that I am).  He starts pulling sites and deploying characters, concentrating on his own objective and ignoring my guys at JP, which hurts him, since he has to lose every turn to my objective.  So I fortify JP with Gallid and company, get sites out, load up a couple of BH ships and park them at Y4.  He tries to deploy LS Death Star and Trench, until I tell him you can’t do it without flipping the objective, which he does later in the game.  After he does this I get Tatooine Occ. rolling and hit him up for a bunch every turn.  He never got a ship in the air, or a character to Tatooine, but I tried to make it a good learning experience for him.  He was playing SYCFA as well, so he had a penchant for blowing things up, which is cool.  I traded him some DS gunners later to help with his DS Obj (which he didn’t have any).  FW by 25 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  easy win, getting Tat. Occ. up<br/>
Lows:  beating a new guy<br/>
<br/>
Game #2:<br/>
<br/>
My LS vs. Bob Caton’s Dark Deal<br/>
<br/>
Bob got me started in this crazy game, and I have yet to beat him in a tourney.  He insists that this day will come eventually, but not while he’s playing this deck.  I know exactly what to expect (to some extent), cause we played a couple days earlier.  He runs troopers, trooper assaults (plus dark jedi presence for MASSIVE beatdowns), TIEs, does massive damage and retrieval (Abyssin and Short Range Fighters), cancels drains with dreaded imperial starfleet AND Strategic Reserves.  Lots of counters to my drains  My HBX deck stays OFF of CC except for Boussh and TK422, which cut his drains a bit, until he plays Hutt Smooch and captures Leia.  I lost a couple of systems early to drains and couldn’t flip.  He had Dark Deal up and going on turn 2, which put the pressure on me  BAD.  I recovered my lost systems with an All Wings&amp;#8230; but by then it was too late.  FL by 20 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  getting spies out<br/>
Lows:  losing systems early.<br/>
<br/>
Game #3:  <br/>
<br/>
My LS vs. Rob’s Dark Deal<br/>
<br/>
Great, another Dark Deal deck.  I’m getting sick of these.  I’ve played Rob before, and we have good games.  He’s a great guy to play against.  His DD deck is a little different than Bob’s the previous game, and this game proves to be more interactive, since Rob is running some HEAVY space - Executor, Chimaera, etc.  My saving grace was that he got the Deal going slow, I set up my systems and deployed my ships.  My systems were Coruscant (drain 3), Bespin (to be able to combat CC DD decks that just run Bespin:CC, Ralltir (screws over RalOps decks plus some other niceties as you will read later), Endor (free move from Rend. Pt.), Kessel (drain 3), and Kiffex (drain 2).  I set a trap with RLiR1 at Ralltir and 5 X-wings at Endor, with one having a Laser cannon.  He drops Big Ex and Piett at Ralltir, initiates without reading LS Ralltir text, which allows me to react.  I react 5 ships, play Organized attack, Power Pivot to get power 26 to power 0.  Scoop.  This is the second time Rob has been involved in the loss of a BIG ship with me, as I played a previous game with him at another tourney where I blew up his Home One with a bunch of Chadra Fans on it with the DS2 Superlaser!  Cool!  Anyway, he probes my HB on the first try, cancelling my objective, and it’s a drain race from then.  We get down to the end and he has 7 cards left but has Battle Plan (whatever the DS card name is) and I have to pay to drain.  I can drain for 7 and have enough to do so, or I can All Wings&amp;#8230; to retrieve, but lose a turn of drains (as he’s draining for 7 too) so I decide to just get the win and not worry about differential.  Fun game.  FW by 10 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  power pivot Executor&amp;#8230;cool!<br/>
Lows:  Playing another damn Dark Deal deck!<br/>
<br/>
Game #4:<br/>
<br/>
My DS vs. Pat Ziagos’ RST Podracing Bunker Blowing<br/>
<br/>
Cool..  I get to play the reigning PA state champ.  Crap&amp;#8230; he’s playing the unbeatable deck!  He barely wins the podrace, blows the bunker, I drain on Tatooine (I had Mara w/ stick, Gallid and friends at the AC, with a  presence of the force, draining for 4, and Palpy, Janus and POTF on the Great Pit draining for 3!!), but my drains are not enough to offset a 28 card swing from pods and bunker blowing.  I did cramp his style turn one though, a little bit.  Pat likes playing lots of Out of Commissions, and I grabbed the first one he played!  He ended up throwing away about 6 on drains - GREAT move!  FL by 17 - if only I had won the pod race, but drawing 1’s doesn’t help Sebulba’s chances.<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing Pat - always a challenge.  Scrambling to deploy everything I could before he blew the bunker and I had to discard my hand to used pile.<br/>
Lows:  RST is TOUGH, especially if you lose the podrace.<br/>
<br/>
Game #5:<br/>
<br/>
My DS vs. Matt’s HBX<br/>
<br/>
Not much to tell here.  He was playing my LS deck.  I recognized this and spread VERY thin on the ground and did as much draining as I could, but he eventually flipped.  I probed two systems (neither was his HB) - one cost me a beatdown (poor Bossk!).  He cancelled drains and drained me out.  He actually was the only one who attempted to come to JP, by deploying TK422, but I None Shall Pass’d him back.  Cool.  FL by 18 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  none, really<br/>
Lows:  Getting beatdown by X-wings.<br/>
<br/>
Game #6:<br/>
<br/>
Bye<br/>
<br/>
I hate byes.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I finished 3-3, which is average for me.  Did some good trading, which is half the fun.  Hope you enjoyed the TR.<br/>
