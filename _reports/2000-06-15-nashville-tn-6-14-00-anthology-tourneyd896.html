<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">About a week and a half ago I was talked into running a Sealed Deck Anthology tournament at Collector's World in Nashville. At first I didn't want to run another Sealed Deck (kinda swore them off) but the player was very persuasive and persistant (called me twice a day for 3 days to convince me). So relectantly I decide to go ahead and set it up. And so our story begins...<br/>
<br/>
Here's a run down of who played and where they placed:<br/>
Russell Cleeton +6 +83 Light<br/>
John Hyland +6 +74 Light<br/>
Me +6 +57 Light<br/>
Maura Chace +2 -29 Dark<br/>
Matt Bodnar +2 -32 Dark<br/>
Matthew Henthorn +2 -37 Dark<br/>
Jon Tomayko 0 -45 Dark<br/>
Kan Chanthaseng 0 -65 Light (A Newbie!)<br/>
Drops: Clint Hays and Steven Lewis<br/>
<br/>
As you can see it wasn't a good day for the Dark Side. <br/>
<br/>
Well in order to get the tournament underway and not to have an odd number of people playing in the sealed deck, I entered the tournament myself, which kills any idea of sending the scores into Decipher. Oh well. Everyone buys their product and I tell the players to wait on opening the product but two players just couldn't wait and just had to start without everyone else. And they had also swapped cards with each other before I had even made the pairings. So I pair them up and get pissed off. I annouce that the owner of the shop will give out a pack of Reflections to everyone that finishes the tournament.I then sit down across Matt Henthorn and build our decks out of our 3rd Anthologies.<br/>
<br/>
Well I pulled every SE X-Wing Jockey and their X-Wings, plus 2 X-Wing cannons! So I know I'm gonna own space, but my ground wasn't that strong. Hell, what can 20 Operatives do for you in a sealed deck... PLENTY! I also pulled a Signal and a Bargining Table. Hella-Strong! Plus I got Herc Seff! <br/>
<br/>
Game 1:<br/>
Vs. Matt Henthorn<br/>
<br/>
Well I started with Bothawui and the Bargining Table. He started with Tatooine and no starting interrupt.I Dropped ships in space and a farm on Bothawui. On the following turns I drain him at Tatooine and at the Farm with a Bothawui Op and friends. He's slow to committ to space and when he does I blast him out of the sky with X-Wing cannons and a Draw Their Fire. Battle in Space and block the poke drains on the Lars Farm with an Op every turn on the Table. <br/>
<br/>
FW +23<br/>
Highs: Kick Ass Space Battles!<br/>
Lows: None<br/>
<br/>
After their first game Steven and Clint decide to drop out of the tournament and get their free pack. Clint and Steve argue with the store owner on whether or not they will get their free packs. Eventually I'm involved in the discussion and Clint and Steve throw their packs at the counter and storm out of the shop. Then Clint or Steven says something under their breath about the store and the owner of the shop runs out after them shouting profanity. We are then informed that Clint and Steven are banned from all Collector's World locations. Never a dull moment...<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
Jon Tomayko<br/>
<br/>
Ah my arch nemesis... In sanctioned constructed play, he always seems to beat me, but in sealed deck: He's my @#$%.<br/>
He starts Local Uprising on Tatooine. I start with the same stuff, and the game goes exactly like the last one did. He battle's me in space, and losses. I block drains on the ground with the table. I drain in space. He drains at his &lt;&gt; Tatooine sites. Early on he drops two womp rats on the swamp and they proceed to eat my Bothawui Ops until I got a Sandspeeder down there for the Op to climb into. But in the end it was a close game.<br/>
<br/>
FW +15<br/>
Highs: Beating Jon. <br/>
Lows: Womp Rats... nasty little bastards.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:<br/>
Matt Bodnar<br/>
<br/>
He starts the Audience Chamber and drops a couple aliens in there. I get no Aliens in my opening hand and I draw everything. Again no luck in drawing those pesky Ops. So I take a couple of turns of Drains in the AC. Plus he's got ships at Bothawui draining me. And I can't draw crap! About 3 turns later I drop 2 X-Wings, Medium Frieghter and a B-Wing aginst the damn Landing Craft at Bothwaui. He barriers the B-Wing. Battle. I draw a 6 for destiny and he losses a lot. That was the start of me getting back into the game. He deploys like two more systems the next turn and sets up more drains on Tatooine. I just drain him to death in space while Herc Seff and his posse clean house on Tatooine. Fun as hell game!<br/>
<br/>
FW: +19<br/>
Highs: Herc is the man!<br/>
Lows: Not drawing crap the entire game!<br/>
<br/>
After that Game we all got a pack of Reflections and talked about how badly Dark Side got the shaft. <br/>
<br/>
Hope You Enjoy the read.<br/>
