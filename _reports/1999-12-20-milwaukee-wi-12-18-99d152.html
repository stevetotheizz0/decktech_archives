<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This tourney was at Egomania Comics in Milwaukee, WI<br/>
<br/>
    well, i get up early only to find that in fact im not going shopping this <br/>
morning, so i quick get my cards, (its like 1 and the thing starts at 1 so i <br/>
gotta leave at about 1230) and put together some decks ive been talking <br/>
about.. <br/>
<br/>
DS is hunt down/force advantage- plenty of characters, First Strike, <br/>
prescense of the force, no dulling, but starts the epic duel for the fakie <br/>
effect (i usually just assume people duel when im playing vs hunt down until <br/>
they prove to me otherwise), and some big blue type stuff like walkers, etc.. <br/>
has all the specific counters (torture, search and destroy, sec precautions, <br/>
CHYBC, etc.) and actually doesnt bother with crush given that theyre not <br/>
going to revo all the sites i have in there anyway, and a couple are immune <br/>
anyway.. <br/>
<br/>
LS is force advantage starting obi's hut with a bunch of stuff to go against <br/>
various DS including mains and toys and destiny adders (only 3 of these), <br/>
landing claws, and undercover spies, along with bacta/redemption and all <br/>
kinds of nasty junk.. <br/>
<br/>
so the tournament has 9 people (wow, not too many) and only 3 of them are <br/>
above 1700, two of which are named fojtik (me and my bro--1950s), speaking of <br/>
which, my brother is using 2 of my decks, and im not too happy about that <br/>
when i find out hes altered them slightly to fit his 'style'.. anyhow, we <br/>
start.. <br/>
<br/>
First Game vs Eric Butzlaff (1500 something)<br/>
<br/>
It becomes perfectly apparent hes duelling when he starts hunt down, and Op <br/>
enforcement, expecting me to come with toshci station vs. his hunt down, but <br/>
i surprise him by laying an Op enforcement of my own, and the game starts.. I <br/>
get a bunch of 2/0 sites, and he gets this weird look on his face like <br/>
'ohmygod, i cant beat revos', but luckily for him, im not playing any.. <br/>
anyway, he comes down to toschi station after i play it on my turn, and <br/>
respond by putting up a bothan and EPP leia to the executor to whack visage.. <br/>
 he drains for 1 at toschi (vader w/saber) and lets me go.. i realize i cant <br/>
drain at the executor without flipping huntdown back (leia is there) so i lay <br/>
the lower corridor with luke and obi there, and stare at the courage of a <br/>
skywalker in my hand.. at this point i should say that there are over 25 <br/>
cards that are 5 or 6 destiny in my deck, so i think im doing fine here.. so <br/>
he pciks up vader on his turn after draining, and i drain, while he doesnt <br/>
lay vader on his follwing turn (assuming he doesnt have enough duel cards?).. <br/>
so he comes down next turn with EPP vader (after deploying some stuff at obis <br/>
hut and moving it over), and duels luke.. i add a destiny, but somehow pick a <br/>
0,4,1 which just isnt enough, and luke goes to the dark side and obi goes <br/>
down.. so i lay a bothan undercover at obis hut, and put up another ben at <br/>
the cantina, with LSaber proficiency.. so im draining for 5, hes draining for <br/>
1, its not gonna work, and his walker cant follow into the cantina to fight <br/>
ben..  he picks up vader again, and i lay civil disorder on my following <br/>
turn.. battle order is in play, so were both paying for drains, but its <br/>
hurting him more because i activate about 20 and he has about 15 or so, so im <br/>
winning the generation battle.. so he finally comes down with vader and some <br/>
scrubs, initiates battle, duels, but picks a 6,1 when i pick a 5,6.. i dont <br/>
even have to use the glancing blow i have, and the swing and a miss wasnt <br/>
necessary as he didnt have his last focussed attack.. this is game over, as <br/>
he loses 9, his guys get cleared, and he gets drained out before he can pick <br/>
up and deploy another vader...  <br/>

<br/>
Game 2 My DS Hunt Down vs. Tom ?? (1530) Train to 5<br/>
<br/>
This is an uneventful game, as in the middle, he says something to the effect <br/>
of 'wow, you dont seem as tough as your reputation'.. its like 'thanks'.. <br/>
anyway, he starts the training, and gets it going quickly, but unfortunately, <br/>
hes got counter assaults and cheese, which just simply doesnt win vs big <br/>
blue... he tries a few EPP skirmishes, but to no avail, his stuff gets <br/>
cleared, i prevent his drains and retreival with CHYBC, and ive even got <br/>
secret plans at the end, which doesnt even matter since he couldnt retreive <br/>
when he flips anyway.. he cancelled visage twice in the game, but the <br/>
constant AAA, visage, search and destroy made short work of his deck.. my <br/>
drain of 5 was enough to easily stop him.. i dont think he ever drained all <br/>
game.. <br/>
FW by 25 4(+36)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 DS Hunt Down vs. Aaron Fojtik (1950s) LS Hidden base/ Numbers<br/>
<br/>
Ok, this is my hidden base numbers deck, which essentially contains a bunch <br/>
of 3 destiny alien character/pilots, a bunch of spies and undercovers, and a <br/>
copy each of the EPPs.. Im not fearing numbers at this point, as ive got 3 <br/>
torture, and visgae/search and destroy on my side.. he deploys a spy early to <br/>
the executor, so vader and DS-61-3 pay him a visit, and beat him up for 10... <br/>
he flips HB after i get my battlegrounds set up, and eventually i take care <br/>
of kiffex with a couple DSSDs, and 2 pilots.. to make a long story short, i <br/>
lose about 20 from numbers (i NEVER saw a torture.. my last 3 cards were <br/>
tortures, they never came up for destiny, so i couldnt track them, and he inst<br/>
erted at the end so i could activate really)... and it takes me forever to <br/>
find my ships (i lose 4 off the top out of 4 cards lost total for one #s), <br/>
and i miss his hidden base after probing 5 out of 6 systems.. still, it was <br/>
close, and visage was cancelled in the middle.. if id ever been able to find <br/>
search and destroy or AAA the game wouldve been mine..  As it was, if id been <br/>
able to probe his hidden base the game wouldve been mine.. if id been able to <br/>
find a TORTURE, the game wouldve been mine.. and i played 3 twi lek, 3 <br/>
torture, and one each of those effects, so its not like it shouldve been that <br/>
hard.. this was one of those 1 in a million games...  <br/>
FL by 10, 4(+26)<br/>
Highlights:Some decent battles, strategy, playing against my bro again <br/>
Lowlights:Losing to a deck i had ALL the possible counters for and really <br/>
shouldnt have lost to.. Probing 5 sytems and missing the base<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My LS Force Advantage vs. His CCT/Beatdown Heavy Character <br/>
<br/>
Ok, giving my brother a deck with 23 characters in it is not the best thing <br/>
in the world when youre playing beatdown.. so i start my usual, he starts <br/>
CCT/Prescense on Obi's Hut.. So he gets vader to Obis Hut 2nd turn,  and when <br/>
i ignore it with a spy+undercover, he deploys myoom with the chamber text and <br/>
decides he really wants to protect her with vader.. At this point ive got <br/>
enough force to jump, but he cant scan, and i want luke (for a destiny adder) <br/>
i draw a few instead of deploying, and he fortifies the hut with a walker and <br/>
tramples my spy, moves vader and co. over, and puts myoom in the walker.. <br/>
well, i didnt get luke on my draw, and hes gonna be activating enough to pop <br/>
my hand now, so i lay a bunch of EPPs, including lando, shoot vader, and <br/>
clear the site.. well, the following turn, he responds with some more <br/>
characters, another vader, walker, tramples the hnmenthe i have, and <br/>
initiates for free with BO (haha) and nails two of my characters with a 6 <br/>
destiny (i would see this 3 times during the game, totally untracked.. i <br/>
guess he plays 5 masterful moves in that deck).. anyway, so we trade battles, <br/>
and i end up leaving him alone on the hut to drain on CC.. well, he puts up <br/>
two ability 4 aliens to CC to stomp Melaas, and picks a 6, so i lose 2 or 3 <br/>
and melaas, while he loses nothing (i pick a 1 and theyre immune despite the <br/>
huge destiny in my deck.. )... so he ends his turn.. well, to make a long <br/>
story short, i have both a frozen assets and a beggar in hand, and he alters <br/>
the beggar, but has no more for the FA (after i grapple his alter) and i lay <br/>
EPP luke, Han, Nabrun Orrimarko over, and initiate, play dont get @#$%y, draw <br/>
a 5,5,6, i have power 29, he has power 6 (3 destiny, 3 power), and both of <br/>
his guys end up shot.. so he loses 23 to battle damage, and one to DTF, as <br/>
well as 2 to civil disorder on his following turn.. at this point he has <br/>
about 5 cards in his deck, he gets off one last drain for 3, and i end the <br/>
game 2 turns later after his own battle order stuffs him.. <br/>
FW by 22  6 (+48)<br/>
Highlights: REVENGE!!! plus it was nice to see the old school EPP tricks happe<br/>
n again.. plus i waited ALL game like a good little fella to get the jump, <br/>
and didnt waste it on clearing the site with vader, and losing both my EPPs.. <br/>
Lowlights: Having to win on EPP 'cheese'.. <br/>
<br/>
I got third cause my dark got smeared..  dissapointing.. got a chewie (again) <br/>
in an endor pack, and a leia in my prize support.. <br/>
