<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">okay here is the TR from the Outpost 2000 sat. tournament.  THere were 20 people who played that day, I was playing TIGIHis deadbody (will post after this report), and BHBM pip-pip-cheerio drains (BHBM with star destroyers and big drains)<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my LS vs. Justin Alfs and his gay as Elton John TDIGWATT navy trooper odds.<br/>
<br/>
	Okay as is going to be the theme of all my LS games this game ended in 1 battle, he had Choke Vader and Palpy holding Luke at the back door. I deploy Han and Leia epp style, plus Chewie Protector, he tries to Force Zap chewie, I sense got it.  But Nick the TD rules that Palpy still loses his immmunity and is def value -2 since that is a seperate sentence at the start of the lost text.  I then deploy Obi-w/stick.  Battle, chop Vader, Satm/BP him away, shoot palpy, draw Battle destiny 5,5,1 he draws 2 from IHYN and draws about 5 total.  He loses palpy and about 22 more.  He then spreads out on CC and sets up dark deal, qui-gon pay a visit to a lone trooper, and kill him for some force.  THe game ended with a drain race, and I won thatnks to the sizeable head start.  FW by 15<br/>
<br/>
On a side note we played a rematch and Justin won by  about 15 oh well it was the only game his DS would win all day:).<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my DS vs. Chris who later traded me an emperor for a AA quigon, and his HB  OMDH	<br/>
	Okay about 10 mins into this game he said "you won" I said what lets play it out.  I drained him in space, he really did nothing, he caused some early damage with suicide luke and my objective did some damage, but I really didn’t know what he was trying until I Saw OMDH hit the lost pile and no Alderaan on table.  It turns out that he accidentally put his only alderaan under his obbjective, so he really had no chance of winning.  I think I would have done okay anyway, but this win really didn’t feel good.  FW by about 20<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 my LS vs. Rich jeffery and his Court of the evil podracer.<br/>
	Okay this game ended when I SATMed Ephant Mon and beat Jabba for 29 overflow with my epp hit squad.  I lost the podrace, but that only served to lower my diff since he hadn’t saved force so there was no retrieval for him (why doesn’t everyone play with Aim High) sorry this was so short, but this game was a 29 overflow beatdown on about turn 5 and then drain out.  FW by about 20.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 my DS vs. Jeff Casper (the friendly ghost:) and his EBO Y-wings.<br/>
<br/>
	Okay before this game I head Kohmann tell jeff that he stood a good chance, now I had never played Jeff, but Kohmann has played me enough to know that I am always tough to play, and it bugged me to hear him marginalize me like that (you lost your props there kohmann, especially since I am still way above 500 against you).  This game was a race for me to keep control of 2 systems to keep Imperial decree running, while still getting my drains in and giving him some battle damage.  Unfournately it was marred by a disagreement where I said something unnecessarily hurtful when Jeff wanted to play the game with no takebacks and I wanted to take back moving a ship that ultimatly wouldn’t have mattered much.   Otherwise it was a very strategic and fun game with Battle plan and Imperial decree pulling out a tight win for me.  FW by 5<br/>
<br/>
	Okay I just want to say I’m sorry again to Jeff, I didn"t mean tto hurt your feelings and I hope we are okay with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 my DS vs. Rob Jeffery and his TIGIH<br/>
<br/>
	Okay I knew that this was a bad matchup, but I played crappy by forgetting to pull systems, and dropping star destroyers there, but Rob still beat me very badly, he just kept throwing scouts at me at the Endor DB and I couldn’t stop him. FL by 23<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 my LS vs. Rob and his copy of Richs Court podracing.<br/>
<br/>
	This game ended about the same way, I just barely lost the podrace, but since he didn’t have enough to retrieve it just made me lose 11, then I jumped Mighty Jabba wiht EPP hand and Leia, plus a nabruned over Obi and Luke, and he lost about 30 overflow.  Game..<br/>
	FW by 23<br/>
<br/>
Okay so I finished 5-1 with a terribly crappy diff but since I was the only 5-1 without a timed win I won the tourney and got a Foil Twi’lek.  Soryr the LS descriptions are so short, but when you cause 20-30 overflow in a game in one battle there really isn’t anything else that the DS can do.<br/>
