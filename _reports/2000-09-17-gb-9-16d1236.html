<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">     Well, after going 4-1 last tourney and going up in ratings a bit my goal this time was to go over 1600.  I kept my TIGIH Speeders deck cause it just plain rocks and ditched Rallops for a BHBM designed to kill the bane of my existance, Profit, which has taken away my first place chance the last two tourneys, but if also kills just about everything else.  <br/>
     So go to the high school football game the night before, which is even past Green Bay, but am forced to eat at a truck stop to save time instead of something better.  This place was sick.  It smelled like toilet and their road map for the truckers looked more like a Civil War battle map to me.  So I go to the game and we get killed, oh well.<br/>
     So tourney day comes and I get there right on time but of course we have to wait for more people to come.  Quite a few of our regular tourney-goers are at the WCW card tourney so all that’s left are 1500ish people, me at 1579, and Chris Tiesling...so I get paired with Chris first game.  Only 10 are there, so it kinda stinks...not even I Trample Obawan Kid showed.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My BHBM vs. Chris Tiesling (1730) using Matt Upstone’s TIGIH Eloms deck<br/>
I’d much rather have played my LS vs. his Rallops but my luck breaks down again.  So I drop Palpy first turn to the Landing Platform.  He draws up and p@#$%es the turn.  I forgot to remind him the whole game that he couldn’t generate at Luke’s location though he didn’t drain, otherwise he would have activated like 3 the whole time, but oh well.  I back Palpy up with Darth Vader.  He gets out Honor rather than moving Luke.  He then deploys GLiG1 to Kessel and drains me for 3.  I draw for starships and get a Dreadnaught.  Next turn I drop the naught and EPP Boba piloting on GLiG1 and he loses GLiG1 and draws a 0 so I stay, and immediately after Honor.  Then he backs up with General Calrissian on Tantive IV and I believe Melas or someone like that piloting after I reinforced with DiPO, so I lose Dengar he loses General Calrissian and the Dreadnaught and Tantive sit the whole game at Kessel and I really regret losing my Flagship Executor.  He then deploys Cracken and 2 Eloms to the Docking Bay.  I activate, drop Vader’s Stick on my Vader, drain for 2 and p@#$%.  He moves the Eloms to the Throne Room after deploying another Elom.  So now he’s draining for 4 and not moving Luke and I don’t bother to fetch him because Palpy can’t move to the D*II: Docking Bay right now to begin with.  I’m draining for 2 and doing 3 with Your Destiny.  I know that my +1 in damage can’t hold up forever so I have to do something.  I deploy Iggy with Gun, 4-LOM with Gun, and Dannik to the Throne Room and battle.  I capture an Elom with Iggy, and my kill off another Elom while I prefer to forfeit Dannik and 4-LOM instead of Iggy, who has an Elom.  He then reinforces the site with another Elom, so he now has 2 and a destiny against my 4 and destiny, but I decide not to battle.  I draw up and find some goodies.  I drop Sim Aloo to the Landing Platform and Tempest 1 to the Death Star II Docking Bay and transit Vader and Sim over vs. Cracken and EPP Leia and You Are Beaten Leia, not expecting much out of his 3 card hand.  He deploys an Elom and moves the Eloms at the Throne Room over.  I drain with Palpy and drop Tarkin and battle at the Bay.  I cancel his destiny and draw a 5 myself so he’s practically dead.  Next turn he reinforced with another Elom and p@#$%es.  I battle and kill everyone there.  He loses the 4th card for Insignificant Rebellion and then draws up his last two.  He had a 6 tracked and 1 card on I Feel The Conflict for Anakin Skywalker, so he thought my moving to YAB Leia was the game, though I don’t know how he would have gotten Luke to be lost to play it.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 (+13)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning, beating Eloms.<br/>
Lows: He activated +4 all game and shouldn’t have.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My TIGIH vs. Jeffery Nickel’s (1475) Corulag Ops<br/>
When he starts this I’m like dead, must not be too familiar with all the counters.  It was real too.  He starts a Bargaining Table also.  First turn he drops 3 sites, Motti, Praji, and an operative.  I activate tons because with all his sites he’s giving me and Corulag that’s +5 to my already 6 so I beat down with a Rebel Speeder, 2 Snowspeeders, and a Sandspeeder, along with KFC.  We both draw 3 for destiny, he loses all but Motti and and I lose 1 speeder.  Next turn he deploys more scrubs and battles.  I still have tons more power and win, stacking another card.  He has to forfeit all.  I then spread out and deploy 3 X-Wings to Corulag, still can’t find Incom or a Signal.  So I’m draining for 5 (2 at Landing Platform, 1 at Corulag, 1 at Forest, 1 at Desert.) He drops the Death Star @#$%ault Squadron and battles my X-Wings, making me lose 1 of them.  I land the X-Wings next turn and spread out to 3 sites.  He drops DVDLOTS, though the D* @#$%ault Squadron prevents him from doing that, on my site with a speeder and an X-Wing and I forfeit both.  My drain next turn kills him off.  <br/>
<br/>
FW 4 (+48)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning without S-Foils, Maneuvering Flaps, or Incom.<br/>
Lows: Not getting S-Foils, Flaps, or Incom which would have put a number and a half on him.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My BHBM vs. Conrad Weis (1479) Ewoks<br/>
I drop Palpy to the Landing Platform after deploying it via Arrest Order.  So drops Chief Chirpa and 2 Sentries to Chirpa’s Hut and Chewbacca of Kashyyyk.  I pick up a couple and let him go.  He moves Chirpa and Chewie over after deploying another Sentry to Chirpa’s Hut.  I drop Mara to Chirpa’s Hut but as always can’t find her Saber but battle, making him forfeit the Sentries and then move Mara over to aid Palpy.  He drops General Solo and then I deploy DLOTS, Janus, EPP Boba, and battle.  He reacts over the Sentries and I choke CoK.  I forfeit nothing cause of his zip destiny and he forfeits all his non-uniques, and I have Amanaman place a Tribesman out of play.  I move Palpy to the Throne Room.  He comes back with more Ewoks.  I drop Janus and Emperor’s Power and battle, stacking a 4th card after my battle destiny is 10 and arrtition is +1 cause Amanaman beheaded.  Amanaman gets to behead Kazak this time.  Next turn he gives my Jedi Luke and moves his guys away.  I chase his guys and Rise, My Friend Luke then move to the Throne Room.  I really want to cross Luke, so now I’m draining for 2 and he’s draining for 1 and retrieving 1.  I keep on dueling and losing what I know are 1’s.  After about the 6th duel and the 5th time he draws 2 Ewok Catapults for duel destinies I draw Security Precautions and that’s game.<br/>
<br/>
FW 6 (+68)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Turning Luke.<br/>
Lows: He started to catch up on me while I was fooling around and dueling.  <br/>
<br/>
So Chris and I are opposite sides and all I need to do is win with TIGH and I win it all.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My TIGIH vs. Conrad Weis (1479) TIEs.<br/>
He didn;t get Seinar out the whole game.  He started Kessel.  I moved Luke over, dropped the Back Door and 2 Speeders there.  He draws up for 3 turns straight cause he’sed of beating all the newbies and then getting creamed by me all the time.  He finally drops Tyrant to Kessel.  I have Incom out and drop 4 X-Wings and battle.  He loses Tyrant, 1 for I Feel The Conflict, and 2 from damage.  I lose nothing.  He then deploys TIE heaven and battles, but I’m still more powerful.  I stack a second card and he has to forfeit all.  I drain for 6 a few turns and then he deploys Dark Lord Of The Sith to capture Luke.  I now drain for 4 and I only have 2 on I Feel The Conflict so I beat DVDLOTS down with speeders and that’s game.<br/>
<br/>
FW 8 (+100)<br/>
<br/>
So I take my first tourney with an interesting differential.  I went to Denny’s afterwards and had undercooked motzerella sticks and you probably know the Dessert selection.  <br/>
