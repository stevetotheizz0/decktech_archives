eric hunter here reporting on a tournament that happend in bridgwater. i suck at typing and i hate using word cause the font goes all funny if there is a error...... well anywho i’m doing this straight from decktech so the speeling may suck(speeling... see? it sucks). well anywho here it is:<br/>
<br/>
at like 9:40 i wake up.... i go and aplly my super tech.....CINAMON POP TARTS......ummmmm...yummmy. well anywho i go take a shower and make my decks. i’m playing the same thing from last week for dark, which is a isb scum with 9 ors. i take out mob points and put in power of the hut to take out jabba’s rides for space and ground. these aditions helped out a lot. for light i made a new age throne room with 3 goo ney tay cause i like making them pay a lot of force for vader and emperor. i also use meditation cause i would put jedi luke to home 1 db then move him over so i can use fallen portal...... well anywho my brother then takes a shower and i’m all done and stuff so i see what’s on the tv. being a deprived child, my parents decided i don’t need cable so i see what’s on the normal stations. i surf for a little and see the only good thing on is...... The View.......WTF?so i watch that for a little cause i love the shots of the audience(only college and highschool girls) then my bro comes down. we leave for the tournament at like 11:30.....well anywho on the way down we listen to the radio for a few then we put in the transformers soundtrack. the first song is the one where hot rod turns into uptimus hotrodiums or whatever so i do his impression..."now light our darkest hour".....then i do my unicron impresseion to when he gets blown up..."i canno...uuhhh... unicro... uhh will nev....beahhh.. destro..uhhhhhhhhhh"(it sounds really good in person). so anywho we are pumped because of the 80’s music so we are cruzing down and when me make it to bridgewater and we get lost :( we finnaly make it put then we find we have to go to the church to play so we go there and get ready....<br/>
<br/>

game 1 john "wow" bragg 1500 mkos thing.<br/>
well i start by taking out a db and putting a twix down, i put mirax to the db and let him go. he pulls the ac and puts jabba and other miny scrubs. i activatate a bunch and use mirax and get a twix with the draw. i play that and another db placing kal fal on that one.... obi comes down to the ac.... i expect none shall pass put find none. i battle, chop 1 guy... draw a 5.... i tihnk he had one guy left. well anywho i keep coming down onto the ac with some guys.... i fannaly take it with epp han and epp liea with anikan stick. i play i know and take out all of his charecters. from there i drain and track my ooc’s to on the edge with. i also had moved mirax and kal fal to the tat db i play with and had run kal all the way over to the ac from db(landspeed=3). eventualy i just drain him out but not before like 7 ooc’s being played.<br/>

game 2 dan mailloux 1560’s tat celabration thingy.<br/>
i get a damned awful start with no tat:jp, so i just draw and stuff. he draws and stuff. i then pull out the jabb’s cruiser and the site to get more activation i also put down a desert next to his mos eisly and farm and tat system. so i start putting down some isb guys(ors) and i flip, however i had monoked before and got 2 land with vibro pants. next turn he just draws and i just drain all the while trying to get the ac for scum. eventualy he gets out home 1 and falcon with cp’n han to the tat system. i just sit high and mighty draining. he finaly comes down with some guys to get celebration going along with menace fades. so he drains for 2(i at cantina, 1 at tat sytem because of launching the assualt) and retrives a force while i drain for like 5 and retrive a force. eventualy he tries to take me on put i trample, sneak attack, and retrive like mad so beat him up. he had tatione untouchable so i didn’t even bother there. when the game ended i had guys at all the tatione sites.<br/>

highs: ors yeah!!!!!<br/>
lows: beating him by a lot.<br/>
<br/>
so now my bro and i buy a lot of L5R. i would buy osme rawedal but they didn’t have any packs left. but i did end up buying a spirit starter from spirit wars, a pearl edition crane starter, and 8 packs of spirit wars. my bro got a lot more though.  also i got doji reju who is my @#$%.<br/>
<br/>
game 3 steve "stevie b" beroni 1815 new age throne room with tech"<br/>
well anywho i am screwed again with no locations cept the dessert. so he’s activating like 15 and me like 4 for a few turns. i did get out no bargin and den of thievs though which helped a lot. i eventualy get out the land crusier to the deesert where corrna was. i also got out jp and ac too. he puts down goo ney tay and orimarko to the dessert(he couldn’t move away and he already had leia and luke draing for 4 at the ac). i put down jabba, chall bacon, a at-st, like 4 ors’s and i flip and battle. i cause him to lose 2 overflow in batledamage. i then retrive a agent and let him go. i play 3 grabbers in my deck and i had grabbed his yoda’s stew and his ooc/tt so he couldn’t get much of his high destiny down.so now it was a drain race for a little bit and with isb i was winning. i then ploped a at-at and 2 ors to where edge was at the home 1 db. i put down scum to the ac(he had only 3 force saved) and battle i draw a 4 and i make him lose 4 force. eventualy he smacks these guys but i retrive the damage.i also move over to jp but he comes over and i non shall pass. eventualy i battle though cause i didn’t want to get creamed cause of fallen portal. but basicly  i out drain him, retrive 8 force with ors cause of abyssin ornament. game.<br/>

well i activate put down a db and a twix and a scrub and let him go. he puts down a scrub and a db and let’s me got. i put down another twix, db, and scrub. being the fool that i am i forget to leave a force for barrier. he putd down mara and her saber to my hothe db where my blount is present. he battles swing and... misses!!!!!!!! well i just loss blount. then i try to take out mara but i don’t.... basicly i then put down epp leia with anikins saber and meditation to his cc db. he plays dr e and vader battles and operates. if he hadn’t and tried for overflow damage my 3 ooc’s in hand would of made vader out of play. but he played smart. basicly i could never get a foot hold on him. he was activating to much and had his sites preety well defended. there was nothing i could do cept suicide runs to hopfully take out vader... didn;t happen.<br/>
