<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Pre-tournament:<br/>
Me and some friends (seven !) planned to go to that Belgium tournament since a lot of good european players would be there too. Me and my partner Jimmy Faelens playtested a lot that saturday and since we weren’t satisfied by our lightside deck yet we continued to play until 5 a.m., found the last cards and went sleep at 5.30 a.m. ! We woke up hardly at 8 a.m. and went to Liege. We arrived at 11.00 a.m. WOW ! 41 players showed up for that tournament and those very good players were there: Marteen Logghe, Koen Meijssen, Bastian Prot, Jan Willem Spikes...(sorry if I have made some mistakes in the names :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Decks:<br/>
My dark was again classic Bring Him due to the high competition and since it is my best deck.<br/>
My lightside was strange but it could beat easily BHBM and Hunt Down. It is a fake Hidden Base with the Epp’s family and "The Cousin": Wedge Antilles Rogue Squad Leader x3. With the unique rogues he is awesome (go read my French Main&amp;Toys on my own page). I use Throw Me a Charge and Throw a weather Vane for some battles and Edges tech.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game#1 Light against Marc Thery (BHBM)<br/>
He deploys fastly his mains (Palpatine, Vader, Sim, Janus and some Bounty hunters) on docking bays. I give him Luke and set up Menace Fades on Sullust (Home One + Akbar + Haashn + Thanespi + Haven) and on a docking bay (a rogue, Wedge "the cousin" and a main) with the help of some tunnel visions. We drained a few and he never went to space. Then Obi went to Cloud City for some Off the Edge techs and Wedge followed his guys (they were spread in 2 groups and I avoided Dengar Ecc) with Order To Engage. He put Mara and  Zuckuss in front of Obi then battled. He hit obi with mara’s stick and I played Clash of Saber on her. No sense ?...no (in a Bring Him...hmm :-) I had track 2 six’s (for battles or Edge techs). I drew an unknown destiny and a 6 for the saber then the other 6 for destiny. He drew his and lost zuckuss + 8 cards. After a few battles, I made On/Off the edges to retrieve and won...<br/>
FW 2(+25)<br/>
<br/>
Game#2 Dark against Fax ? (Profit)<br/>
He played Profit (easy matchup with Bring Him) and like your best friend started with Draw Their Fire :-) Palpatine w/Force Lightning and Sim Aloo paid a visit to Boba Epp and Mighty Jabba in the chamber. He started drawing a lot of cards and I asked him his hand’s size to make him fear a monnok. I put a ship on Rendili and he put Lando w/ axe + Melas on Throne Room. I answer with Mara + Stick + First Strike. I battled and retrieved 2 , he lost 2, Lando was hit and missed to exclude Mara. I drew high and he drew low, thanks to Janus and Sim Aloo. Then he deployed Ben + saber + Lightsaber Proficiency on Tosche Station.  "Judge Dred" (Lord Vader + saber) came battle him. No trick for me, thanks to First Strike and SACs. I hit Ben and he didn’t. I drew high and he drew low, thanks to Janus and Sim Aloo :-) In the late game Master Luke + Leia Epp + another ability 4 guy came in the chamber then battled. No trick for me, thanks to SACs :-) I drew my 3 destinies and all his guys were dead. On my turn he lost 3 to your destiny and my drains won me the game...<br/>
FW 2(+31)<br/>
   4(+56)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game#3 Dark against Martijn Peeters (There is good in him)<br/>
He started Goo Nee Tay...@#$%...no emperor 1st turn to choke him...took a drain of 1...took a drain of 2 by waiting Vader (I haven’t capture Luke with Palpy since I would had to lost 3 at the end of my turn due to objectives and a Lord Vader was in my force pile). I convert the endor docking bay, drew all cards (but only one SAC) and put Judge Dred the next turn on Landing Platform to captured his son. He put Lando w/axe + Taws Khaa on tatooine DB. Due to my lack of sleeping I forgot Lost in the Wild and drained with Vader. Martijn played it...I sense...he sense...even with Taws Khaa as his highest ability guy he suceeded the sense and I prayed...he drew 0’s, thanks to my old friend the Home One:DB. Palpy + Janus went to Cloud City DB for more activation, Lord "big balls" Vader hide into Chief chirpa’s Hut and Bossk + Dengar in ships went at Rendili. To reduce my drains he played Revolution on Hut and moved Lando + Taws Khaa in front of Palpy. Thanks to Janus, I could track high destinies for playing Set For Stun on Taws Khaa and battled (I added First Strike and Mara + stick). Lando got hit, he failed to exclude Palpy and he died + 12 cards lost + one card stacked. On his turn he deployed Super Falcon against my ships but thanks to Revolution on Hut he couldn’t afford to pay 2 more from Projective Telepathy. On my turn Janus let me drew Set For Stun (retrieved with First Strike) and Captain Han leave the Falcon. I beat the lone Leia and my drains finished him...<br/>
FW 2(+19)<br/>
   6(+75)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game#4 Light against Koen Meijssen (MKOS with Abyssins)<br/>
He pulled off his sites with Jabba’s Palace and Jabba’s Sail Barge . He flipped his objective and set up some drains in Lower Passage and in Audience Chamber while I put Home One + Haash’n + Akbar on Sullust. I put one rogue with Wedge + Han on Desert Heart but he deployed Den of Thieves to prevent that drain. 2 Tunnel Visions let me to get Order To Engage and Fallen Portal (I feared Mercenary Pilot on Sail Barge since he would have draw 2 destinies). I moved in front on the Barge with a second rogue + Luke Epp + Obi Epp + Order To Engage. He initiated the battle and retrieved with Scum + perhaps First Strike (I don’t remember if he had it yet) but played Projective Telepathy which I stacked. A second battle on Desert Heart and a second Projective Telepathy stacked. I started to recirculate my 6’s and added Leia Epp in a rogue. I think he lost one time 3 forces to OTE but the first battle took place on Jabba’s Palace. He has deployed a moderate number of Abyssins + Mercenary Pilot + Boba Epp + 4-Lom. Like planned, Fallen Portal killed the Mercenary Pilot and an Abyssin. 4-Lom prevent Leia from adding a battle and firing, 2 other Abyssins were hit by my 2 lightsabers and we both drew 2 battle destinies (due to Han and Boba Epp). After that, Point Man canceled OTE, Harc Seff prevented his drains on Audience Chamber and on Desert Heart and I suceeded to make 2 Off the Edge despite of Secret Plan and my small reserve deck. But at that time, I knew I will lose that game since Koen canceled my drain on Palace (with Den of Thieves) and just lost an Abyssin to my Sullust’s drain. Then he retrieved the Abyssin with his objective and just redrew it. He finished by adding a drain on my endor docking bay and retrieve 5 with Jabba’s Twerps...<br/>
FL 0(-13)<br/>
   6(+62)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game#5 Dark against Christophe Vandalem (EBO)<br/>
He started with Heading for the Frigate instead of ANSB. I set up fast drains with Emperor + Mara + Vader + sticks despite of Battle Plan. He hide Luke aboard a rogue on 4th marker but I forgot all the game that Luke had to be present for not loosing from Your Destiny. So I could have used Ig-88 to capture Luke by sensing the eventual barrier then hide him under the shield to avoid Ice Storm and let me use Search&amp;Destroy. So he drained of one all the game with Luke. I slowed Christophe to set up EBO by sensing The Signal and altering Garrison (to prevent him from pulIing off his 3 guys). I lost a few from Do or Do Not but no Wise Advice. I deployed Flagship Executor and a Dreadnaught on Rendili to covert Battle plan. He deployed a red pilot + wedge + some ships (+ cannon) before mine and battled but Projective Telepathy prevent him. I recirculated my Force Lightning (no Janus yet)... On my turn I played Set For Stun on Wedge (drew the Lightning) and added Zuckuss in ship + Boba Epp + Ig-88 Ecc + First Strike. I battled, retrieved Set For Stun and he shot Zuckuss (but he didn’t make him lost). I drew 2 destinies (Ig-88) and his was reduced to zero. On his turn he suceeded to set up EBO and deployed I’ll Take The Leader (he could drain on hoth:DB). He deployed Hoth, Wedge and moved his ships to Hoth. He played 2 On the Edge but I sensed the 2: Do or Do Not was hurting me :-( Due to Menace Fades, my drains was low but I moved the Dreadnaught with the bounty hunters over Hoth and drew the Set For Stun which in my force pile (I kept tracking it since it was the lone soluce against Wedge). On his turn he played a third On the Edge (no sense), drained of 2 and put Order to Engage. Menace Fades was still in effect but I known where I had an Alter in my deck. So Set For Stun on Wedge (I drew Alter...), he played Out of Nowhere but I destroyed his ships but one which couldn’t afford to drew destiny on his next turn. So whithout Menaces Fades, my drains killed him even if Do or Do Not had hurt me bad (12 forces lost !)...<br/>
FW 2 (+3)<br/>
   8(+65)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game#6 Light against Milan Angeli (Set Your Course/Scum&amp;Vilainy)<br/>
He had Jabba’s Palace in his starting hand and pulled off all of his sites. I deployed fastly my Super Home 1 on Sullust with Haven. Then I used the same strategy that against Koen (Game#4) but whithout Harc Seff early lost: I put all the Epp’s family and "The Cousin" Wedge in my rogues at Jabba’s Palace (by moving from Tatooine docking bay to avoid None Shall pass). All the game he attacked my army with a lot of bounty hunters who add destiny (Zuckuss, 4-Lom, Ig-88,...) to retrieve with Scum and First Strike. I always topdecked 6’s, so each times he lost all his guys and I just canceled a battle destiny and lost a main by remplacing it next turn. Never I got Fallen Portal but I didn’t really need it. I played 1 On the Edge and 1 Off the Edge to retrieve 10 despite Secret Plan and stacks. In the late game I played Surprise Assault (no Hutt Influence ?!?) with 5,6,6 topdecked, against Djas Puhr, Jabba The Hutt and Ephant Mon in the Audience Chamber. He lost 9 forces and my drains finished him...<br/>
FW  2(+17)<br/>
FW 10(+82)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I took 3rd places, Koen Meijssen won and Martijn placed between us. It was all about differential !<br/>
