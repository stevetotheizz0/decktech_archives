<br/>
Id like to start off by saying I was damn lucky. I almost didnt even play in the sealed deck tourny. As I was getting my cards signed by Shannon Boska and Michael Stackpole and about to leave the comic con I heard that there was still a chance to enter the tourny. I said hell yeah Im there. So I pay my money and Im off to the game room. I have some time to kill so I play a quick game with with a guy I met, Marco. All right so now its game time, they call pairings, we sit down, they hand us our Coruscant and Tatooine cards and we start makin the decks. (oh yeah by the way....the Coruscant cards werent even in the packs) So here I am with forty some odd dark side cards. As I look at the Coruscant cards I realize I dont have a damn clue what the hell im looking at... does anyone else know how hard it is to throw a deck together in 15 minutes with cards youve never seen? By the way my only good rare was Darth maul. Onto the games. Im dark for the day .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1   Sorry I forgot most of everyones names...hey I didn&amp;#8217;t think Id actually win<br/>
Ok here we go I see everyone around me get all the right cards to use the objectives.....All i got for a start is the Blockade Flagship Bridge...not a bad starting location. It&amp;#8217;s a 2-0 site so I have the advantage. He deploys the Mos Espa market as his starting. So far im force choking him, I deploy Rachalt Hyst. Now this biach from Tatooine saved my life and was my best character the whole day. Check this out...first off when armed with a weapon she adds 1 to force drain....yeah....when opponent draws an interrupt for battle destiny may use 2 force to make that card lost. Now thats what im talking about. So i get the early force drains in. The whole game he has trouble saving force and deploying enough ability to get a battle destiny draw. So I take control of a few sites, put Watto to his Junkyard and i&amp;#8217;,m getting a good force drain of 4 going on at two sites. Meanwhile he deploys Mace Windu about 3 sites away and I dont bother and let the drain of 1 go. I retrieve a few from the Espa market and my sith probe droid and in the end my tracked 7 destiny does him in. I battle him, he doesn&amp;#8217;t get destiny, I out power him and he loses 9. That&amp;#8217;s game FW +17<br/>
<br/>
2(+17)<br/>
<br/>
Ok im thinking wow not bad I survived with the worst pile of cards Id ever seen. <br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Forgot the name...nice guy though<br/>
I start same location, he starts outskirts. I get Rachalt, my woman in my opening hand and this cool droid....check out this game text. (Opponent&amp;#8217;s jedi require +2 force to move away from him, then during any control phase I can place the droid out of play to make one jedi present power and immunity to attrition 0.) Thats some good piece of droid as.s  Anyway I got him in my hand too. first thing I do is put the droid at his outskirts so he doesn&amp;#8217;t deploy any jedi from reserve deck....turns out he doesn&amp;#8217;t have any anyway. So now I concentrate my forces on coruscant and the senate. right now Im out draining him 3 to 1. I think im ok then he tries to take me over in the senate. Luckily almost all my characters are sweet senators.... so after a few battles, his guys are gone and my coruscant guards and some senators are still there. In the end I just out drain him and I track my lucky seven again and wipe out some of his characters for the final win.  FW +8<br/>
<br/>
4(+25)<br/>
<br/>
Now I&amp;#8217;m psyched ...I havent lost yet. <br/>
<br/>
Game 3 sorry man...the guy with the dog town hat.<br/>
He starts the Jedi Council...I figure game over for me he has jedi...im done for. I gotta play smart. Activate my 3 and say go. Im saving up so I can deploy enough ability to get destiny.  His turn he gets out a naboo site. I figure all right I can deploy there and move my guys over to the jedi council to get the drain....Oh hey Alex way to go you just deployed all your guys to naboo. Dumbass. I think ok...ok... not a problem i can get my guys off some how. He deploys like mad...the wookie senator and some other power 2 guys. I figure wow im gone. Luckily I draw high destiny, he draws low. I lose one character, he loses 2. We both have 1 character at the site. Ok Ok....I can make my move now....I deploy  3 guys and battle...he doesnt get destiny so he has some overflow. By then I finally had maul and my woman in my hand. Next turn I deploy them to his tatooine  wattos junkyard site.  Eventually he takes back naboo. But now he has 4 characters stranded there only draining for 1. I&amp;#8217;m set up now.. I got a drain of 2 at Tatooine, drain of 1 at the senate and a drain of 3 at his jedi council chamber. A couple turns go by and that&amp;#8217;s game for him. FW +13<br/>
<br/>
6(+38)<br/>
<br/>
Now i&amp;#8217;m thinking damn.. I have a chance at this.....so I make sure I remember this last guys name.<br/>
As of now theres only 5 undefeated players out of 91. By the way this was the biggest comic con tournament  to that day. <br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs Mike<br/>
He was a cool guy.....kind of a mix between Jay and Silent Bob.....anyway he started the jedi council. We go on about how old school these sealed deck games are. Mike knew what he was doing... I was just trying to keep up. He gets the Mos Espa DB and outskirts deployed. I have the senate and Blockade Bridge. Then I figure I lost this game as soon as he deployed the Coruscant system and 4 ships and this effect where his drains were plus 2 at adjacent sites of his mos espa db. So he&amp;#8217;s got the drain of four going. I figure I can&amp;#8217;t mess with his space... mainly because he over deployed  and I only had one ship. Then he gets Qui gon to the outskirts. I cant mess with that....but Darth Maul can. I take over his jedi council chamber he tries to fight me off but I eventually get it. Then maul takes it to the outskirts so he can&amp;#8217;t get that drain of 3. Now I got the drain of 5 to his 1. 2 turns and he is out. FW +11<br/>
<br/>
8(+49)<br/>
<br/>
I cant believe I went undefeated.  So far I had the highest differential. And it was up to the last game everyone was watching. Lucky for me time was called on their game and I knew it was in the bag. Just goes to show...you dont need jacked up jedi when you got crazy fcked up aliens. I win the dark uncut rares sheet cause I played smart and didnt over deploy. With 40 card decks you gotta watch yourself. <br/>
