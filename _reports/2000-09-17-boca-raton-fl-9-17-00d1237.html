to go by very fast.<br/>
<br/>
# of Players : 8 ( Sanctioned )<br/>
TD : Richard Davis<br/>
<br/>
Decks : <br/>
LS - Scout Craze w/ Good Objective. Lots of guys<br/>
DS - Anti-Profit.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : My LS vs. Philip Vasquez’s BHBM (1500s)<br/>
<br/>
	I get my stuff set up right away and drain him with<br/>
Super Luke for a lot.  I beat him up once at his Docking Bay <br/>
and stack 2 cards on my objective. He deploys Lots of TIEs<br/>
up to Mon Calamari but doesn’t have SFSystems or much. He<br/>
had like 3 Emperors and 3 Lord Vaders but didn’t really <br/>
matter. I win handily by 27. Record : 2 (+27)<br/>
<br/>
High : Winning<br/>
Lows : nothing<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : My DS vs. Jeff Alexander’s Good Objective (1700s)<br/>
<br/>
	Hmm. I get my Tatooine stuff and draw like crazy.<br/>
I’ve got like a 20 card hand and he’s got lots of space stuff<br/>
so I’m drawing a lot to figure out what I’m gonna do. Vader<br/>
and Stick are holding Luke at his Endor Docking Bay and<br/>
Boelo is in the Chamber while I’m using Search and Destroy<br/>
to do my damage. Battle Order is slowing the game down which<br/>
is a bonus in my favor I think. He gets out Boussh and drops<br/>
a pilot down to fulfill Search and Destroy. I drop Mara and<br/>
Evazan and I chase him around for basically the rest of the<br/>
game. He deploys Kessel and move Home One over to Kessel<br/>
leaving two matching pilots to hold Tatooine. I deploy <br/>
IG-2000w/ IG and Fett in Ride and draw a 9 destiny to get<br/>
rid of Home One and retrieve/lose with First Strike. So now<br/>
I get free drains. Obi-Wan comes down to run around with<br/>
Boussh and finally they stand up and are force to fight so<br/>
I operate on Boussh ( I remembered the +1 from Oppressive<br/>
Enforcement for Executor and that was the difference ) use<br/>
4-LOM to cancel Ben’s immunity and Ben’s gone. Search and<br/>
Destroy and that’s pretty much game. Win by 12 I think.<br/>
Record : 4 ( +39 )<br/>
<br/>
Highs : Winning when I had some mistakes , not losing a <br/>
battle.<br/>
Lows : Having to draw a gazillion.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : My LS vs. David Irvine’s Scum deck (2000s)<br/>
<br/>
	I get setup again and hit him with Super Luke Drains.<br/>
I send Harc seff and people over to Jabba’s Palace to seal a<br/>
drain or two. Stack a card here and there and the drains were<br/>
what really killed him. Win by 18. 6 ( +57 ) <br/>
<br/>
Highs : I think this is the first time I’ve beaten David.<br/>
Lows : IG-88 captured EPP Leia , IG is annoying.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 : My DS v. Andrew Wise’s Profit Deck (1700s)<br/>
<br/>
	Well my Deck is Anti-Profit and his is Profit<br/>
so you probably figure out what is gonna happen. I get<br/>
everything running pretty smooth and its brutal for him.<br/>
I think the worst part was Choke Vader w/ Stick versus<br/>
Geezum and Crix Madine. I choke Geezum which is expected<br/>
but I go to hit Madine and he plays Dodge. For those that<br/>
don’t know Dodge subtracts 3 from every weapon destiny so<br/>
my total weapon destiny is -6 and Crix is value of 3 so<br/>
I need a 10 to hit him and I get it so he loses like Crix<br/>
and 8 and then later Vader crushes and Arcona for 6-7<br/>
more. I also had Occupation and Search and Destroy up,<br/>
Honor of the Jedi saved him lots of Force as did ICBWorse<br/>
but the damage was pooring in from everywhere. Win by 32.<br/>
Record : 8 ( +89 )<br/>
<br/>
Highs : Win the tournament. First tournament after Dagobah<br/>
Regionals and I did okay.<br/>
Lows : Really destroying Wise. <br/>
<br/>
I’m sorry this is such a small TReport but it just kinda <br/>
seems like a blur so I’ll go with some Tournament Observations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tournament Observations : <br/>
-Decktech seems to have a strong influence , little kids had<br/>
really good decks they just needed to learn how to play them.<br/>
-Dodge is insanely good.<br/>
-Profit needs force.<br/>
-Lots of characters is the way to go.<br/>
