<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">PRE Tourney: Sadly, this could be one of the last SWCCG tournaments we have here in Sydney. This is due to a waning interest in the game, most likely due to the virtual certainty that Decipher Co. will lose the license to produce this game; resulting in the game we have come to know and love, simply ceasing to exist. The uncertain future of the game has lead to a lot of the players from round here turning to LOTR TCG. In the event that decipher did lose the license I for one would not be investing any time or money in that piece of @ss game. If I wanted to compare the power of elves and &amp;#8216;conjure&amp;#8217; orcs for one turn before they disappear, Id play Magic. The mechanics of the game are just too simplistic and boring. Not only that but it appears that who ever has the most ultra rare Witch Kings and Cave Trolls with all the support cards just pummels the opposition unless they themselves have the same loads of rare cards. This eliminates from contention, the players who are just playing from their starters for fun. But hey Im not criticizing anyone if thats their cup of tea  <br/>
	Enough about that lets get into the games. About 8-9 ppl. Turned up for the tournament (hence the lack luster, future prospects of the game). I was playing QMC for LS as I have for quite a while now and Senate for DS. it was a toss up between my to Ds decks of Senate and Dark Deal, and even though DD is better against LSC I felt like giving Senate another try.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1: QMC vs Brett Chaiyawatts Dark Combat.<br/>
Brett is a top player around here, but he rarely comes to tournaments. For some reason he decided to grace us with his presence at the tourney. After spending 20 minutes on the train with him telling him how DSC gets raped by QMC and just about every other LS deck out there, I was unpleasantly surprised to see him pull combat on me. I started BP/DTF as my 3rd effect to slow him as combat is USUALLY very weak in space. Unlucky for me, I had no ship or pilot in my start hand so I had to draw for it after dropping a site from hand and deck. Brett mob points rendili from reserve,drops piett to the executor db, pulls merrejk, pulls bespin system and accelerates for the effect that drops executor for free to bespin. Ah oh. The few times I have lost with QMC (and I think this is QMCs major weakness) is when the opponent drops a load of star destroyers on bespin system and you spend all game trying to remove him while he drains elsewhere, unhindered by menace fades. In my turn I draw up looking for more ships again and get wedge+ship, Artoo in red5 and dash. in his turn brett drops maul to gen core and draws. In my turn I activate drop leia rebel ho and Hnemthe (works well with the GooNeeTay, bespin choke idea) to CC with a path in hand and save.<br/>
	Brett pays to drain drops palpy and janus to the naboo gen and saves.<br/>
I activate deploy wedge, ship, to the system flip pull outrider from force, and pull farm boy luke from reserve. Brett declines to drain and deploys executor for free, with thrawn, chiraneu, blizzard 4 as passenger and moves piett and merrejk to pilot capacity. In my turn I drain, deploy celebration and drop another pilot in the outrider and drop obi wan EPP to another CC site. No battle. Brett drains for 5. ouch. He lateral damages outrider and puts mauls sith infiltrator in passenger capacity on the executor. Battle. He plays Imp. Command but I sense it. He draws a couple destiny and I cancel one. He loses nothing and I lose 4 cards overflow. From here on out it just gets worst as I plink for a 2-3 cards retrieve 2-3 cards,. But maul gets his double stick and drains for 4 and palpy drains for 3 while I struggle to survive against the executor. At one point I alter Lat. Damage and Power Pivot the executor. But he just forfeits Blizzard, mauls ship and piett.<br/>
Without M/fades he just out ran me.<br/>
FL 0&amp;#8211;18<br/>
Highs: good game against a good player we havent seen in awhile<br/>
Lows: a sad day for the mighty QMC<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2 Senate vs Clarrie Browns LSC<br/>
I knew this was going to be a nasty game. I know how to beat LS combat but just don&amp;#8217;t have the cards to do it.(I really need an EPP Maul Giles, you b@stard J/k)<br/>
So i establish the senate and start plinking for 1 for a couple turns while clarrie draws up to establish his hand. Soon he POAS the senate to kill the drain. So Zuckuss in Ship goes to Rendili to drain for 3 with the aid of Motion Supported. That only works for on turn before A Vergeance in the Force nutures the drain. Then the b@stard starts playing Visored Vision on me Sqabbling Delegates, stinging me for 3 force! EPP Vader goes on a suicide mission against R3 Obi wan he trys to dash away put I cancel it with Ghhhk combo and I kill him to attrition, with the aid of Our blockade is perfectly legal and toonbuck toora. With 4 cards in lost pile Vader narrowly escapes and OOC. Clarrie puts Qui-gon one site and Obi on another and starts draining while Im barely draining at all. I save for a turn more take another drain and drop Tat maul, EPP Vader, Rune Haako, ozzel and Xizor against Qui gon but he dashes away again.<br/>
	Im sitting pretty now, as he has to move in from of my 2 dark Jedi and he can only duel one. He deploys EPP han, EPP Luke, puts a combat card sunder qui-gon and moves both obi and qui-gon over with han and luke. He draws a 3 and reveals his combat bionic hand(7 destiny) . I miraculasly draw the Phantom Menace AND The Point is Conceded! (7+6). So he loses 2 cards. I smile to myself thinking with those to tracked now I&amp;#8217;ll never lose another combat. Then he plays Visored Vision (which I grab) and kills the point is conceded!<br/>
	Its all down hill from here, cause I drop P-59 and battle, Vader misses qui-gon due to swing and a miss, luke misses P-59, P-59 hits Han and sends him to used via the gen core, but Qui-gon hits vader. He draws a 6 and I draw a 5. I lose xizor and vader and he loses luke. I move away. In his turn he follows and duels maul with qui-gon and I lose 4 cards. I deploy Vader again battle draw a 7 and a 0 against qui gon, he hits everything and that&amp;#8217;s about game. He drains me to hel b4 I can gather enough even with lott dod.L<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;16<br/>
0 &amp;#8211;34<br/>
<br/>
Highs: none to speak of<br/>
Lows: worst tournament performance in quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3: Senate Vs Robbies WYS<br/>
Robs playing vintage style WYS and this is one Im sure in can win. I play comfortably, establishing the senate, canceling Kessal drain with This is Outrageous, getting maul to the landing site and his ship at the DB. Rob sends ANH wedge in ship to Tatooine system and flips. I have chimeara and Imp. Command in hand but decide to keep the command and draw thrawn via Lott Dod. Apparently Rob had a Hyper Escape but First Strike prevented it. Down come Thrawn on chimeara with 3 destiny to Wedges one which was reduced by 3 via the poli effect. He loses wedge + a few cards.<br/>
I pay to drain at tatooine with +2 from motion supported but the drain is cancelled by Control/TV (surprise, surprise) I grab it. Maul gets in his sith boat and flys up to help thrawn. Rob trys to set up in the cantina but Dre/Ponda and P-59 cause a lot of hurt. Eventually melas gets to the outrider so he can battle Maul, but I reinforce with boba in ship and Lott Dod pulls back my lone Imp. Command. My guys are immune to his single destiny and my 2 destiny +3 leaves only dash and melas. I retrieve with Squabbling delegates and drain at his cantina. Red 7 goes off the top and his x wing laser goes from hand so no zapping or power pivot. Not much he could do from there.<br/>
FW +22<br/>
2 &amp;#8211;12<br/>
<br/>
Highs: big win, fun game. Everthing went right.<br/>
Lows: not much chance of getting better than 2nd now.<br/>
<br/>
GAME4 QMC vs Robbies Watto, You re a Slave<br/>
Rob starts racing with expand the empire on the arena so watto can&amp;#8217;t be battled. I set up comfortably and lose 2 for 2 turns to avoid a free executor or some crap. Leia and melas go to the sites for a flip I celebrate. Now stupidly I risk it without a path in hand. Rob drops Boba Bounty Hunter and Xizor on melas. He waits for the path. It doesnt come. He battles. Draws two destiny, I draw one. I lose melas and 14! Ah crap. Obi wan goes to Watto&amp;#8217;s junkyard, alters Expand the empire, hits Watto so he loses watto +2<br/>
 Next turn he wins the race. I lose 6 more. Now my paths come so I drop every scrub I can find to a site on their own to drain and retrieve via celebration. <br/>
Obi drains at the junk yard, but maul clears him off. EPP Han and chewie protector sacrifice themselves to clear off boba fett and xizor. It can wait  bounces vader at critical times. And miraculasly I win. Rob can barely pay for Battle Plan to drain while I drain for 5 and retrieve 4. Its a slow grind but I over take him and pull out the win.<br/>
FW+6<br/>
4 -12<br/>
Highs: nice come back<br/>
Lows: eventually rob played IAO/ Secret Plans but it was too late. If it had come out earlier it woulda hurt bad.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 5 QMC vs Steves Build the Death Star.<br/>
This one could have gone either way. We both set up as usually I put guys on the ground and he puts out sectors. I deviate from my usual set up to beat up a lonely dreadnaught with wedge. Wedge then gets shot down by baron fel next run. Saber gets carried to bespin by another dreadnaught. I realize that the baron can easily shot 3 of the other 4 ships in my deck. Only farm boy on artoo in red 5 could overcome the tie laser with its 8 maneuver. But if I missed my shot on saber1 Id lose em to attrition. I pull farm boy luke with squad ass. Deploy him to bespin and flip I grab the laser from force.i battle fire the laser and draw a 5. bits of the baron get stuck on the @#$% pit window. <br/>
After that I reinforce bespin with dash and kier santage. And begin celebrating back the lost force. Even though steve successfully constructs the death star, he can&amp;#8217;t occupy another system and it does work at endor, so essentially he doesnt do me any more damage for the rest of the game. I play lost interrupts from hand just to retrieve em with celebration.<br/>
FW +32<br/>
6 +20<br/>
Highs: FarmBoy the hero<br/>
Lows: none really.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 6: Senate vs steves OldSkool profit<br/>
Profit is an easy match up for senate really. I start Arica in the A/C. Steve flips early but Arcia follows luke and Han and I just lose 1 to the objective. I set up the senate without Lott Dod, for some reason I couldnt pick him or a delegates till half way throught the game. Orn free ta, Yeb Yeb and Tikkes made up the senate contingent. I cancelled Ben Kenobis Drains with This is Outrageous. Epp Vader and Maul for free to the landing site invaded Tatooine and chased Han around until He was corner by Ig-88 and 4-LOM. Han died but came back on the other side of tatooine. Zuckussed draining at rendili for 1-3 just wore him down. Rune Haako with P-59 and dre/ponda pulled apart a larger force of han, Quigon and lando scoundrel with help from Yeb Yeb.<br/>
After the dust settled from a full on war of a game Steve had no-one left on tatooine so I spread and drained with a ghhhk and a force field in hand. late game. I retrieved with first strike and rune all game and b4 he picked up I played squabbling delegates to net another 4 cards from lost pile.<br/>
FW +24<br/>
8 +44<br/>
<br/>
Highs: fun game full of battles I knew I was going to win<br/>
Lows: if steve had run Fallen portals It could have hurt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah so 8 +44 somehow got me second place and I got another Lott Dod I sorely needed. the final standings look like this<br/>
Tyng yan Yen   12 +100 odd<br/>
Me             8+44<br/>
Clarrie Brown  8+30 odd<br/>
Ben May        8 + 20<br/>
Brett Chaiyawatt 6 +something (his damn DSC only win was against me)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok later all, and whatever gaming is still fun<br/>
