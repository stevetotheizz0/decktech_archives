<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok, this is gonna be a crappy TR, since its a little late, and i dont really remember what happened, since i did play 12 games that weekend.<br/>
<br/>
---Pre Tourney BS---<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so I flew down to Atlanta on Thursday, since it was only 130 bucks round trip because delta owns atlanta and my uncle is cool and let me stay with him and gave me rides and stuff so i didnt have to rent a car/hotel room.<br/>
<br/>
We went around on Thursday, just cruisin, ate at the Vortex, it kinda sucked, but the BLT was decent there. After that I dont remember much, but we probably just drove around and looked for stuff to do. We also did this team trivia thing that seems pretty big in Atlanta. Naturally, I knew that everywhere in Atlanta would serve only Coke, so I asked for Pepsi everwhere we went, just to tick waiters off, and it worked. Our team trivia name was "Team Pepsi". Kinda sucks that we lost tho, we were in the running till the end, but bombed the last question.<br/>
<br/>
Friday, we start off by getting up late to go to the coke place, CNN center and just around. Coke sucked, it was like paying 6 bucks for a huge commercial. And a bad commercial at that. Dont go to coke. CNN kicked major @#$% compared to coke, and youd think it would be the other way around, wouldnt you? As soon as we finished at CNN, we went to the Nuevo Laredo Cantina, this kick @#$% mexican place. Best Mexican Place Ever. Ever. ’Nuff Said.<br/>

Ok, for decks, i took RST and whack-@$$ non-epic dueling huntdown. It was non sanctioned, so why not just play around.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS vs Neal Razi’s RST non-racing<br/>
<br/>
Well, I gave Neal an early owning in this game. Visage was never meant to stay on table for any amount of time with this deck. It took me 2 turns to find Vader, but he stayed around for a while, until the bunker got blown up. Since it was unsanctioned, I figured that i might as well have some fun, so I moved vader and tarkin to endor, and they got smacked around. More fun than a drain race. It was a fun game, and Neal is one of the best guys ever to play the game. Sorry i dont have more on this game, but im a little brain dead, plus it was just a bunch of trivia moves, as visage just ate him away before he beat on me.<br/>

FL -19<br/>
0 (-19)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS vs Eric L (not sure on the last name)’s SYCFA<br/>
<br/>
RST sucks. Well, it does when you let them blow up endor with the death star. Eric was a cool guy, and it was unsanctioned, so i didnt care though. He only pulled off a win by 9, as i had a y wing with a landing claw on it for the entire game bogging him down, and when he moved, itd drop off, drain, then move and get back on during his control phase. i blew up the bunker, and won the podrace tho, but luke, han, leia and the rest of em were all lost when it blew, then a few more force. It was fun though, and Eric was a really cool guy.<br/>
<br/>
FL -9<br/>
0 (-28)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS vs Johnathan ?’s Slave Mains<br/>
<br/>
Ok, slave mains, hahaha! Instant win. Im not too sure on this game, but I think that he got rid of visage early. sweet. that left me open to non-epic duel with no care in the word. he put down luke and was draining, feeling that he was safe, since i didnt start epic duel. I got vader down to drain for a bunch, but when luke came, i picked up vader for 4 force, then i dropped him the next turn, to move and duel, i tracked 3 sixes, and played focused attack, so luke got absolutely schooled, and i retrieved 11, and he lost 11. just like a pod race :-) oh, and i placed my obj out of play, who cares?<br/>
<br/>
FW +20<br/>

<br/>
Game 4: LS vs Brian Rippetoe’s SYCFA<br/>
<br/>
damn, this guy is good. he was just schooling me, he beat me in the race, epp vader came down for several beats, and i just generally played poorly, but it was about 11:30pm when this game started, and i was tired as hell. After a few turns it was obvious he was going to win, and he needed some outrageous diff to make the final duel and fight for free entry, so i just let him cycle his entire deck and hand back into his turn, with an operational as planned, and the brangus thing.  since it was unsanctioned, who cares? i lost by 42, instead of 20 something.<br/>
<br/>
FL -42<br/>
2 (-50)<br/>
<br/>
well, brian missed out on the final duel by 5 diff or something like that, so that sucks. i stuck around and played some raw deal with neal and david, and they completely kick ass. the warm up was tons of fun, and i couldnt wait for the dpc.. even tho i got to bed at 2am, and i wanted to be there at 10:30. oh well<br/>
<br/>
