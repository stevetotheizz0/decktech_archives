<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is just part one of an overly long, extended and<br/>
comprehensive tournament report of RamapoCon II. I have<br/>
about seven hours until my flight outta here and a computer<br/>
lab with T-1 internet access.<br/>
<br/>

Pre-tourney notes<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
So my finals end on the Sunday before this tourney, and I<br/>
have nothing to do for like five days. I talk to Clint and<br/>
we're all about prepping for Ramapo all day Tuesday and <br/>
Wednesday. Sunday and Monday I'm throwing together all these<br/>
goofy decks like Vegas-style and EV9D9 and Yavin 4 droids<br/>
Twigg-style, plus keeping together as much as possible the<br/>
tried and true, like ROPs and Hunt Down beats and Yavin 4<br/>
mains. Vegas-style is cool as hell and I'm thinking it'd be<br/>
fun to play this stuff if I got to learn how to play it.<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday rolls around and me and Clint test a whole bunch at<br/>
a local store. Stevens Turner and Lewis drop by and we play<br/>
a little. Vegas-style flops around while getting trashed by<br/>
Yavin 4 all day long. Numbers eats it alive and the Casino<br/>
is nowhere to be found. So I scrap this deck but I figure<br/>
it'd be a hella fun to play for No Such Thing As Luck. I've<br/>
got like six decks and nothing innovative that works so <br/>
I'm set on playing some of my old stuff that does allright.<br/>
<br/>
On Thursday I catch an early flight up to St Louis, then <br/>
connect to Newark, NJ. Scotty Lingrell hooks me up with a<br/>
and we wait around for Charlie Herren's flight to roll in <br/>
from Atlanta. It ends up being delayed for like an hour and <br/>
a half so we get a bite to eat, wait on Charlie, then drive<br/>
back up to Ramapo to crash at Scott's place. Me and Charlie <br/>
are psyched for Sunday's team tourney - we had agreed with <br/>
Brentson and Dalton on a team for it. We end up playing our<br/>
different decks at some place on campus with Scott's goofy<br/>
Anktopot and Juz's Revenge that gets pushed around by <br/>
ROPs. At like 2 am we head over to Scott's and crash for <br/>
the night.<br/>

Friday's tournament decks<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Friday had the first two tournaments of RamapoCon - two<br/>
four-game sanctioned constructed SW:CCG, one at 3 and one at 7. The<br/>
first one was run by Rich Haman (Red 86) and had twelve <br/>
people, including three guys from Michigan that made the <br/>
long drive. Two guys from Ohio were supposed to come too,<br/>
but they fracked up and drove down the week before. Oops. <br/>
The competition was pretty good - nobody expected a really<br/>
large turnout for the first event. Notables included Mike<br/>
Dalton and Charlie Herren, as well as Scott and myself. <br/>
<br/>
I decided to play Yavin 4 droids and ROPs. Y4 droids was a <br/>
tough call - I think in most places it would work so much<br/>
better than a Yavin 4 mains deck, but here, where Juz's <br/>
Revenge originated, everyone would know how to play against<br/>
it. Since most tournaments end up being all about matchups <br/>
anyways, I figured it'd be cool to play and see how it did <br/>
to help make my choice for the big tourney on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the decks on Friday - I'm posting them here and<br/>
not in the deck section because these decks have been put<br/>
there in every single ass variant possible.<br/>

up your numbers. Jim Sells did his to me at the Detroit GS.<br/>

Brief notes: Your standard ROPs. I don't pack Revolution<br/>
protection because it's a waste of space IMHO. A good Revo<br/>
deck will rip apart ROPs anyways unless you pack like a <br/>
Crush and 3 Evaders, and if you can fit that in here you're<br/>
a champ. Ability^3 is a choice call but I like it - early<br/>
game it forces your opponent to play out of his game, and<br/>
late game it makes him put down guys for you to wreck. It's<br/>
great against Profit and Dagobah, and anything that forces<br/>
your opponent to use force and put down guys when he would <br/>
much rather be drawing for the big beatdown is solid.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
Friday: first tournament<br/>
***<br/>
Game One: my DS vs Todd Theiner (1756)'s Hidden Base mains.<br/>
<br/>
This game was pretty trademark of ROPs - it starts slow<br/>
then mows people down. He started Battle Plan.I got a decent<br/>
draw, put down a 2/0, searched for a site, and drew. He did <br/>
the same during his turn. This went on for two turns, then<br/>
I started saving force and flipped strong like fifth turn.<br/>
Wherever he put down guys, I wrecked them. He eventually<br/>
flipped his Objective but I got Security out and probed<br/>
right within two turns. The deck worked like a machine.<br/>
FW: 2 (+18)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: This deck is an auto-win against Hidden Base. Or <br/>
so I thought...<br/>
Lows: none<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: my LS vs Mike Dalton (2023)'s Court space<br/>
<br/>
I didn't want this matchup at all - Dalton is a good friend<br/>
of Scott's and must have played against Scott's version<br/>
of Y4 droids a billion times. Luckily he was playing a fun <br/>
deck and not his machine Hunt Down or ROPs.<br/>
<br/>
I got an OK draw and put out a Nudj, losing to Court and <br/>
drawing. He started Surface Defense with all three and put<br/>
out an 0/1 Docking Bay, lost to Court, and drew. Next turn,<br/>
he put out some aliens and Scum and fortified the chamber.<br/>
I projectioned the audience chamber, lost to Court for like<br/>
five turns, eventually getting out the Hologameboard, a guy <br/>
there, Battle Plan, and Boussh at the Sarlacc pit to stop<br/>
the Court loss without having to worry about Hutt Smooch<br/>
or any of that trash. He missed a Sniper with IG-88 and we<br/>
were pretty much at a standstill.<br/>
<br/>
The turning point was when I put down Artoo and 8D8 and<br/>
inserted. My total was 11 and his was 3; Hologameboard<br/>
covered my part of Resistance and there were only two <br/>
battlegrounds on the table. His deck was about fortifying<br/>
on the ground and then running space with forfeit and <br/>
bounty hunter ships, but an early monnok revealed Captain<br/>
Han, EPP Leia and the Falcon in my hand, so he was wary of<br/>
playing any space battlegrounds. The insert changed his mind.<br/>
He put out Zuckuss in Mist at Endor, moved Mara over to <br/>
the Sarlacc Pit, put a guy on Zuckuss, moved the Death Star<br/>
(the only other system out) to parsec 1, and drew.<br/>
<br/>
My turn, I put out the Falcon which promptly got barriered. <br/>
Nevertheless, in went Captain Han and Luke EPP (Leia was <br/>
hanging out on the ground undercover). Drew. Insert popped<br/>
for 0 during his turn, and he put down Bossk in and Battled<br/>
the almost super-falcon. I cleared the system with stacked<br/>
destinies and legendary starfighter hit the table. This<br/>
card won me the game. A late Tantive IV and Wedge, and <br/>
a stranded Boba Fett in Slave 1 at the Death Star vs <br/>
the Supra-Falcon and Tantive reinforced the victory.<br/>
FW 2(+6): Cumulative 4(+24)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Legendary Starfighter - thanks Hays for this one.<br/>
A close game... these are the most fun.<br/>
Lows: none, really. It worked well and I played it pretty<br/>
well too.<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: my LS vs Scott Lingrell (1886)'s Anktopot.<br/>
<br/>
This deck is so messed up on paper, but it works like a <br/>
machine! He only plays like 6 different cards with ability,<br/>
and the rest is all about high destinies. He flipped second<br/>
or third turn and got good activation - a Coruscant in his<br/>
opening hand helped this alot (he only runs like five<br/>
locations). I got off one insert, but losing to Visage hurt<br/>
all game long and he tortured my second insert and cancelled<br/>
Uncontrollable. I couldn't draw an EPP with a saber fast <br/>
enough to kill Vader and get around his junk like Put All<br/>
Sections on Alert. Holonet Transmissions killed my TT's. <br/>
This game was a rout.<br/>
FL 0(-16): Cumulative 4(+8)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Taking a few hits early and hanging in the game...<br/>
a different draw might have made it closer.<br/>
Lows: Stopping everything I had for him.<br/>
<br/>
Game Four: ROPs vs Scott Lingrell (1886)'s LS droids.<br/>
<br/>
I knew his deck so he didn't stand much of a chance. I<br/>
started Resistance instead of IAO to force him to deploy a<br/>
guy to cover his portion of occupying at least one<br/>
battleground. I set up fast and put all my guys in walkers<br/>
to avoid the EPP beatdown and have enough forfeit to cover<br/>
any battle damage. He could never get anything going. <br/>
FW 2(+20): Cumulative 6(+28)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: none... I knew his deck and knew what I needed to do<br/>
to absolutely shut it down.<br/>
Lows: the same.<br/>
<br/>
I was the only 3-1, getting second place, while Charlie <br/>
Herren went 4-0 and nabbed first and a Captain Han foil.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
Tournament two<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Many people started to roll in around 5 and 6, including<br/>
Juz Pakes, Kevin Reitzel, and Dan Bojanowski from Yavin 4,<br/>
and Team Albany from Coruscant. The second tournament<br/>
started half an hour or so after the first one ended, with<br/>
28 participants.<br/>
<br/>

Brief notes: This deck was pretty junky for a Y4 deck, but<br/>
I didn't put a lot of time into it. I forgot to put back<br/>
stuff I had taken out for the droid deck, like Draw Their <br/>
Fire and Order to Engage. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Game One: My LS vs Manny Rodriguez (1550)'s Biker Scouts<br/>
<br/>
He started Combat Readiness, taking out Endor: Forest<br/>
Clearing and Dark Forest. I had gotten absolutely raped<br/>
by a deck like this back in Nashville the week before, but<br/>
I had been playing droids instead of mains. Whew. He put<br/>
down a biker scout with a bike at both sites and drew for <br/>
his turn, and I proceeded to destroy them with guys. The<br/>
game was all played on Endor, except for Melas who was<br/>
pinging him for two at the Carbonite Chamber the entire time.<br/>
Savrip was out for protection and basically his troupe of<br/>
seven bikers and bikes, three of which had guns, drained me<br/>
for one or two at one site while I plugged him for 2 with<br/>
Melas, 2 at one of his sites with Han and Chewie and 2 at<br/>
another Endor site with Obi and his saber. Boussh prevented<br/>
him from cancelling my drains with Strategic Reserves. <br/>
The game was over pretty quickly. <br/>
FW 2(+24)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: SAC and mains wreck!<br/>
Lows: none.<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: DS vs Luis Rodriguez (1708)'s QMC deck.<br/>
<br/>
ROPs got a great start in this game, flipping safely by<br/>
third turn. He got a first turn flip with Wedge in Premiere<br/>
Falcon and Lando with at the guest quarters, but Zuckuss and<br/>
Evax reflipped. Once ROps got flipped, I beat him off <br/>
every single location he had a guy on and drained him out. <br/>
He never came to Ralltiir.<br/>
FW 2(+29): Cumulaive 4(+53)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: The deck worked like a machine. Deploy -1 Tarkin,<br/>
Vader and IG-88 with a stacked destiny wrecking the hell<br/>
out of one guy.<br/>
Lows: none.<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: my LS vs Dan Bojanowski (2055)'s ROPs.<br/>
<br/>
This matchup is usually decided by who gets the good draw...<br/>
I got it this game. A bunch of 2/0's in my opening hand put<br/>
Obiwan on his planet with Bacta backup. A saber followed. <br/>
He put out a few guys but a smokescreen and power beat them <br/>
off his planet. Tantive and a guy hit Ralltiir but he <br/>
manhandled them with three bounty hunter ships. That was<br/>
the only low - soon after Oola and Civil Disorder put down<br/>
the lock.<br/>
FW 2(+20ish): Cumulative 6(+70ish)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: The lockdown. A great draw.<br/>
Lows: It would've turned out opposite if he had gotten his <br/>
2/0's and me none..<br/>
<br/>
Game Four: ROPs vs Rich Haman (1767)'s Y4 mains.<br/>
<br/>
Rich is a great guy and this game was solid and a lot of<br/>
fun. He got a pretty good draw, but so did I - we both had<br/>
2/0's out early. He avoided my desert like the plague but <br/>
put down some guys at my docking bay and drew a lot. I got<br/>
enough stuff in my hand to flip but waited a few turns, <br/>
activating and drawing a little bit each time but no more<br/>
than two cards each time. Took a few drains of one or two<br/>
but then I flipped and held it down almost the whole game -<br/>
he flipped me back once but I reflipped the next turn. <br/>
High destinies and not battling until I was ready won the<br/>
game. Pulling anything you want out of your deck is huge!<br/>
FW 2(+teens): Cumulative 8(+80something)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: a great game! Well fought and nobody got really<br/>
screwed with draws.<br/>
Lows: none<br/>
<br/>
Me and Dalton both went undefeated, but I had the higher<br/>
diff so got the Jabba Foil. Scott had everyone sign three<br/>
Endor posters - the one with Luke and Leia flying a speeder<br/>
bike through the forest alongside a biker scout - and those<br/>
were given out as prizes, along with packs. Both tournaments<br/>
were run well - Rich ran the first and Scott the second. <br/>
Brentson didn't play on Friday but between me, Dalton and<br/>
Charlie, we claimed the top two spots both days. Our team<br/>
was looking strong for Sunday! <br/>
<br/>
Props and Slops for Day 1:<br/>
<br/>
Props<br/>
~Scott for handling everything well and moving us to a room<br/>
that had air-conditioning<br/>
~The team for placing well in both tourneys<br/>
~ROPs because it's a machine<br/>
~Juz and Kevin and Dan for making the drive up to play <br/>
(sorry about the 0-4 finish Juz)<br/>
~everyone for being great sports!<br/>
<br/>
Slops<br/>
~The heat - it must've been 95 degrees outside<br/>
~Scott's Anktopot for wrecking the hell outta me<br/>
~Team Albany not playing Friday night to not reveal their<br/>
tech (Hunt Down and Y4... surprise)<br/>
~Ramapo College for closing the cafeteria at 7 p.m. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading all this, it's long as hell but I'm <br/>
gonna be as thorough as possible to cover everything. <br/>
Hopefully I'll be able to put up the big tourney on Saturday<br/>
later today... if not, then soon. Look for Part Two!<br/>
