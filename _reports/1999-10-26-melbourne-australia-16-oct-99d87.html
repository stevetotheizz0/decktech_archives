<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">G'day all,<br/>
I played in regional yesterday, here in Melbourne.  Let's start from the<br/>
beginning:<br/>
7:45am alarm goes off.  I wake up<br/>
7:46am, step-mum comes into the room, and complains that someone rang at<br/>
7:30.  She said that they said 'he'll be up soon anyway.'<br/>
7:47am.  I wonder.  Who on earth could that be?  I've got nothing on today.<br/>
The regional is tomorrow.<br/>
7:48am.  Or is it?  Where's that letter with the details.<br/>
7:49am. @#%$#%%^(A()#@%#@$(@*^%.  It's today.<br/>
7:50am.  Beng calls.  He offers to give me a lift.  I say I'll get in ring<br/>
in 5 minutes.<br/>
7:51am.  'Hey dad, Could I please go out today?'  'The tourney's today, not<br/>
tomorrow.'<br/>
7:52am.  Dad says, 'OK, but I think you're mad.  You've got exams in 2 weeks<br/>
time.'<br/>
7:53am.  Ring Beng.  'Hey Beng, thankyou very much for calling - I'd be<br/>
delighted to get a lift with you.'<br/>
7:54am.  How many cards can I fit in these boxes?  I still haven't built a<br/>
dark side deck.  I think I've got a decklist on the lapop.<br/>
7:55am.  Get dressed<br/>
7:56am.  Get 3 boxes (a shoe box, my anthology deck box, my 'rare' box.)<br/>
Fill them with cards.<br/>
7:57am.  Carry everything outside.<br/>
7:58am.  Wait for Beng<br/>
8:15am.  Beng arrives<br/>
8:16am.  I get in car.<br/>
8:17am.  I rustle through the 2,000 cards I have with me, and try and build<br/>
a DS deck.<br/>
8:18am.  Laptop does not have decklist.  This will make it interesting.<br/>
8:19am.  Start looking through cards, and pulling them out.<br/>
8:56am.  We pull up outside the joint.  I have gone through all the cards,<br/>
and have the basics of a deck.<br/>
8:57am.  Second pass over cards begins.<br/>
9:00am.  Deck almost complete.<br/>
9:05am.  Deck finished. Kev pulls up around this time too (the TD).<br/>
9:06am.  Start filling in command card.<br/>
9:07am.  Start filling in deck list.<br/>
10:00am.  Games begin.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone's interested in a copy of my DS deck, you can find it at<br/>
http://swccg.ript.net or at decktech.net<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, my DS, vs someone from Brisbane or Sydney (sorry, forgot his name).<br/>
He started Hidden Base, looked through his deck for the HB marker, and went<br/>
off to fix his deck :)<br/>
Meanwhile, in the game next to us, Derek has a 65 card deck.  Hmmmm.  He<br/>
fixes it.<br/>
Well, anyway, he gets started, and is really, really flustered by it all.<br/>
Opening hand, he has Artoo + A Gift.  Also, some systems, and JP:AC and<br/>
Obi's Hut.<br/>
So, he plonks it all down, including Artoo to the AC.  Next, comes A Gift.<br/>
I say 'uh uh.  Artoo needs to have just moved for A Gift.'  He reads the<br/>
card and says 'oh.'  So, he redeploys Artoo the Hut, and then moves him in.<br/>
He doesn't play 'A Gift.'  I think 'hmmmm.'<br/>
On my next turn, Motti + Boba w/ Gun deploy to the AC, and then move over to<br/>
the hut to get a quick drain in.<br/>
His turn, during his deploy phase he tries to play A Gift.  This time I put<br/>
greater emphasis on the 'just' bit.  He reads the card and says 'How do I<br/>
deploy it then?'  He then reads it further, and 'oh, I see.  It's an<br/>
Immediate Effect.'  Anyway, a couple of other 2/2 guys (possibly including<br/>
Kal Falnl) come to the Hut, battles, I shoot one, draw a high destiny, and<br/>
he draws a 0.<br/>
Few turns later, Artoo goes back to the Hut, after Motti died, Choke Vader<br/>
comes, gets a glowstick, and slices and dices.  Boba might have died too,<br/>
actually, thanks to EPP Obi.  But EPP Obi is no match for Choke Vader +<br/>
Glowstick + Tarkin + Destiny rig.  So I take control, drain for 4 a few<br/>
times at the Hut, before Artoo finally gets back inside to the AC to become<br/>
a Gift.  On my turn immediately after that I ask him if he wants to move<br/>
Artoo, he does, and I move Vader + Tarkin to the AC (a drain of 3 instead).<br/>
On his next move phase, he goes to move Artoo, I say 'no, undercover spies<br/>
move during the opponent's turn.'  He asks why, I say 'cause it says so in<br/>
the rules, and proceeds to read Artoo + A Gift for a few minutes.  That<br/>
puzzled me, but I was draining for enough at the AC.<br/>
Some time during all this the Tantive 4 deployed to the Death Star, but I<br/>
deployed CHYBC and that stopped him from draining there.  'Da Bus' (as I<br/>
entered it on my decklist) and Blizzard 1 were in orbit of Tatooine, and<br/>
apart from a little resistance here or there, it was a comfortable win to me<br/>
by 25 or so force, with an additional 12 cards in hand.  I drew far too much<br/>
in this game, because he never drained me, and I had no way of getting rid<br/>
of the cards in my hand.<br/>
So, a nice start for me leaves me at 2(+25 or so)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: NO ONE beats Choke Vader, Tarkin Glowstick and stacked<br/>
destinies...<br/>
Lowlights: He was kinda disappointed to see all his Harvests go off the<br/>
reserve deck to the drains, and Beru/Owen to the Choker<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, LS vs Beng<br/>
Beng was playing an ISB Ops sort of deck.  He started Coruscant, I got all<br/>
my sites out w/ MWYHL, and deploy T:JP.  Around this time I was beginning to<br/>
get a little worried 'cause he was draining for 1 at Coruscant and not<br/>
looking like he was giong to come to ground, even though he deployed the<br/>
Hoth, Y4 and Endor Docking Bays with IAO.  He also deployed the CC:PTD, so I<br/>
threw Obi there for a drain of 2, only to be followed by 5d6-ra-7.  I also<br/>
chucked down Wedge + EPP Han to entice someone to the Hoth:DB (Don't Get<br/>
Cocky, Skywalkers etc. in hand).  No luck, but some guy (Vesden?) came to<br/>
the T:JP, so Luke, Leia and Skywalkers made a mess over there, resulting in<br/>
Beng losing 15 or so force.  Obi Nabruned to another docking bay, while it<br/>
was just a mopping up process.  Perhaps there was another big battle in<br/>
there somewhere, but I ended up winning by 25 or so.<br/>
4+49<br/>
<br/>
Game 3, DS vs Stuart Lauder<br/>
Stu was playing Ops.  I was playing beatdown.  Early on I had total control<br/>
of his planet (a couple of walkers) and not even Choking Darth could do<br/>
much.  I was in full control early on, but I think the turning point was<br/>
when he got a couple of spies to a couple of my 2/0 locations and was<br/>
draining there, and just running away on Bothawui.  I was _almost_ able to<br/>
flip the objective back, knocking him down to 2 locations on Bothawui for<br/>
one moment, but it wasn't enough.  I lost by 7 force.<br/>
<br/>
4+42<br/>
<br/>
Game 4, LS vs Anthony Gabel<br/>
Anthony is currently #4 in the region, and from what I hear, a pretty decent<br/>
player.  He's playing Raltiir Ops, I'm playing 'bash the snot out of the<br/>
opponent.'  He started w/ BFHI, and at one stage I got to have a flick<br/>
through his reserve deck, and saw there weren't any Ghhks in there, which<br/>
was nice.  Anyway, he had it all set up as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Jungle:  Lennox + Lobel<br/>
City (?): Tempest Scout 1, Vader, Tarkin, another Lobel<br/>
Prefect's Office: DS-61-2, Lt Renz<br/>
<br/>
I played Surprise Assault at the Jungle to make him lose 3 or 4 force, but<br/>
next turn, the beatdown came:<br/>
Tat:JP had already been down, so Beggar came out, as did DTF (played Tunnel<br/>
Vision for it)<br/>
Then, Obi-Wan (for 9 force) came to the Prefect's Office, using up the final<br/>
3 of his active force.<br/>
I miscalculated here, and I should have deployed Leia instead (I had<br/>
Skywalkers in hand)<br/>
Then, EPP Luke and EPP Han.  Rigged battle destiny (6, 5,5,5) and Don't Get<br/>
Cocky made my total power 35, and I excluded the DS61 guy with Clash, and<br/>
made Renz forfeit 0, meaning a 33 force loss.<br/>
The more observant of you would wonder - Why didn't TS1 (with Vader +<br/>
Tarkin) react across?<br/>
Well, basically, I asked 3 or 4 times whether Vader + Tarkin were in or out.<br/>
Each time Anthony said 'out.'  I figured that as #4 in the region and given<br/>
that there was a pre-regional rules briefing the night before, Anthony had<br/>
an obligation to know the rules about reacting, and this was a regional, and<br/>
so I didn't allow Vader + Tarkin to embark on the Scout for the react.<br/>
He still had 4 or so force left, so when he drained on his next turn I just<br/>
played Surprise Assault (rigged 5s) and he lost the remainder.  I felt<br/>
rather awkward at the end, but there wasn't much I could do.<br/>
If the worse came to the worst, I could've always simply beaten up<br/>
Vader/Tarkin/Little guy, using Clash on Tarkin,<br/>
<br/>
Since we were the first game to finish, we both got our decks checked, but<br/>
there weren't any problems.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5, LS vs Jay Scott Elliot<br/>
Jay...let me remember...14/15 years old, from W.A.  Apparently at this stage<br/>
the highest placed player from 'over there.'<br/>
He started ISB Ops, and I thought, 'here we go...'<br/>
On his first or second or turn out comes T:JP, and in following turns out<br/>
came the JP sites.  So did Mosep, Gailid and SE Jabba.  Those 3 were just<br/>
asking for a Surprise Assault, so they got it, making Jay lose 8 or 9 force,<br/>
which was nice.  Soon, an Outer Rim Scout came outside to the LMF (his<br/>
version), so the beatdown came, saw DTF, and conquered.  Game over.<br/>
20-something win.<br/>
<br/>
Since my game was the first to finish again, I got my other side check,<br/>
which kinda irritated me.  Sure, it has to be done, and I'm probably just<br/>
being paranoid, but it felt like Kev was trying to get me disqualified.  Not<br/>
to worry, everything was in order again.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of this game a few of us went to kick a footy around outside, but<br/>
while we were out, the big 'debate' started up, and I was only able to catch<br/>
the end of it.  Pity...besides which, you've heard/read most of the<br/>
discussion about it on the listserv anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6, DS vs Tyng<br/>
So, lucky me, get to get revenge for him beating Stuart :)<br/>
Tyng seemed rather put off by the last game and the 'discussion' at the end,<br/>
but we have to move on.<br/>
He starts MWYHL, I start Death Star.<br/>
I get a couple of 2/0 sites out + Endor, he gets Yoda's Hut + Yoda (only the<br/>
1 dag site)<br/>
He deploys Momaw Nadon + EPP Luke to Coruscant Imperial Squar.<br/>
He deploys Goo Nee Tay (oh well...im activating 20 force a turn) and<br/>
Insurrection (yes!  Luke's not moving!)<br/>
I deploy CHYBC.  Poor Luke...  :)<br/>
I also deploy a Death Squad Star Destroyer to Endor w/ Snuggle Bear in the<br/>
driver's seat, and set up a nice drain of 2.<br/>
Soon after, Tyng throws down the CC:CC with Chewie, KFC, Wedge and perhaps<br/>
Obi.<br/>
So, I deploy EPP Boba, Choking Darth and Glowstick and battle...Blast The<br/>
Door, Kid!<br/>
Return battle, and a couple of his guys die, and we fighting it out a little<br/>
over there for the next couple of turns, before the real turning point of<br/>
the game.<br/>
He deploys B-Wing and Landing Claw.<br/>
On my turn, I activate, don't drain (because I can't), and deploy J'Quille<br/>
over to the CC:CC.  I ask Tyng if that is OK.  He says 'yep.'<br/>
I then proceed to bash the snot out of the B-Wing (Lateral Damaged), but<br/>
Tyng is fortunate to throw down the Spiral as a react.  Still 8 force is<br/>
lost, and the games pretty much decided, since Tyng had deployed Battle Plan<br/>
a few turns earlier, and J'Quile/Darth were killing his ability 2 guys like<br/>
caustic soda (long story, but basically it was the final day for year 12<br/>
students of school (mine included) yesterday, and some kids at a high school<br/>
threw Caustic Soda on each other, and the ambulance and everything went, and<br/>
it was all quite drastic).  Eventually, since he couldn't drain and I was<br/>
draining for a fair bit, I won by 20 force.<br/>
<br/>
So, at the end of this game, the results were:<br/>
1) Me, 10+124<br/>
2) Stuart Jones, 10+100 or so<br/>
3) Tyng, 10+35<br/>
4) Rodney Lee, 9 + 80 or so.<br/>
<br/>
So, after deck checks, it was to be Stuart and I in the final.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, my LS.<br/>
I play poorly.  He plays OK.<br/>
I'm doing Brenton's Beats, he's doing Ops w/ a few walkers and stuff.<br/>
He throws out an op and some scrub AT-ST to the forest, and I've got Obi,<br/>
Luke, Leia + some destiny adders in my hand, plus DTF.<br/>
I don't want to cop the drain, so I throw Obi at 'em.<br/>
His guys die, mine lives.   I draw one or two, and still don't have my<br/>
Beggar.  He deploys an Op and a big and chunky walker, I deploy Luke, move<br/>
Obi to join him (having GOTM in hand) - Big Mistake.  He runs away all game,<br/>
and the next card I draw is my Beggar and my Han.  If only I'd just drawn, i<br/>
could very well have won.  But hey, I didn't.<br/>
Anyway, that's basically it for the rest of the game - He's running away<br/>
most of it, I'm chasing, he deploys lots of stuff, I occassionally kill a<br/>
little (He has Vader + Op + couple of Walkers, I have Luke + Han.  He rigs<br/>
two fives, he battles, chokes Han, I hit Vader, I Force Is Strong, I draw<br/>
like 3 5s for destiny etc.)<br/>
In the end, after an hour, Stu and I both have 7 life force 'cause I can't<br/>
chase him anymore, and he is draining for heaps.<br/>
He would've won the turn after the next, but it wasn't going to matter.<br/>
<br/>
1+0<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, my DS.<br/>
I play average.  He makes a few mistakes, but his deck is good enough for it<br/>
not to matter.  He's probably looking at playing his LS deck at the Worlds,<br/>
so I won't spoil it, but I just wasn't able to deploy enough stuff to stop<br/>
him, even though I had lots of stuff to deploy.  I probably could have<br/>
extended the game by a turn or two and reduced his differential by 2 or 3,<br/>
but since it was obvious he was going to win (next turn he drains for 6 or<br/>
something, with me having 10 or so force left to lose), I figured it'd be<br/>
best to not make it slow and torturous.  So he ends up with 18 force left, a<br/>
chunky trophy and a trip to the US, and he should do well.<br/>
<br/>
My prediction for world championship winner: Stuart Jones ('cause then I<br/>
could say that I even though missed out on the worlds again, it took the<br/>
world champion to beat me :)<br/>
