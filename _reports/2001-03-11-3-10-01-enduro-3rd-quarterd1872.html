<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">For prior happenings, refer back to 3-10-01 ENDURO 2nd Quarter, written by myself.<br/>
<br/>
During the break:<br/>
I was having fun with my decks, so I decided to stick with them all the way; CPI was just dominating and RTP was fun stuff.  I modified my RTP a tad, hoping for a better go the next Quarter.  This Quarter, the group divided into a Constructed and a Sealed; since I don’t care for Sealed, I stuck with Constructed.  I had some pizza during to break to keep me going, and had drank half of the 2-liter of Coca-Cola I had brought to keep me up.  At 11pm, the 3rd Quarter began for us Constructed players.<br/>
<br/>
The Tournament:<br/>
<br/>
My decks:<br/>
LS - All For Her - mains with insanely high destiny draws<br/>
DS - CPI Navy v3.0 - blow away every system on table, and lockdown the win with Ability, Ability, Ability<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS v. Stephanie Dittman’s TIGIH<br/>
She came with her boyfriend Paul McKelvey, and had sat out the first 2 Quarters.  Right off the bat, she explained how the deck was 100% new to her, so I immediately began to feel bad about what I was going to have to do. Arica and Superlaser in opening hand got me off to a quick start; choked her on her 2nd turn and began the move to a Rebel Base.  Her sites and scouts hit the table, but so do my spies and Strategic Reserves.  Hoth + ADLR came out, and after a failed attempt to CPI it, was disintegrated two turns later.  Endor dropped from sight three turns after that.  AAA lockdown, with Defensive Fire &amp; Hutt Smooch controlling her hand virtually every turn.<br/>
Result: FW +30<br/>
Standing: 2(+30)<br/>
Good Things: Perfect.<br/>
Bad Things: Beating a woman quite thoroughly and horribly.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: She worked the deck well, but nothing ground-based can survive CPI.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, the caffeine started to work my system, and my brain started to do strange things.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS v. Michael "Ass" Mendoza’s Hunt Down no-Vader Flagship Ops<br/>
As he set up FlOps, I was laughing hard.  8D8 freed Leia 3rd turn, and I flipped on the following turn.  He dropped systems and TIEs; I dropped mains everywhere (Corran and a Lift Tube cancelled Visage; I had a Lift Tube Escape in hand to react him away in case of beatdown).  8D8 ran the Death Star Plans for 17.  I Revo-ed the Executor DB, and invaded Executor with Wedge RSL alone at Meditation Chamber with Force saved to react Corran over to join him.  My drains began to exceed his, and had better retrieval going.  8D8 ran the Death Star Plans again for 17.  I also On The Edge-d Corran for 6, then drained him out.<br/>
Result: FW +38<br/>
Standing: 4(+68)<br/>
Good Things: Drain out and no Secret Plans.<br/>
Bad Things: None.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: We were talking so much sh*t that it wasn’t funny half the time since we were both pretty f**ked up from sleep deprivation already.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS v. Paul McKelvey’s HB mains<br/>
Corran Horn infiltrated the Death Star 2nd turn.  His mains followed him in on latter turns, and I couldn’t do squat about it.  Making a scrub move, I Twi’lek for Come Here You Big Coward! instead of Strategic Reserves.  I move the Death Star to Alderaan and hope to blow it away to prevent Our Most Desperate Hour.  He drains big, and I lose a lot.  I miss the CPI on it by 2, so I’m not happy.  He whittles me down to seven cards and I have one last chance to blow away Alderaan.  In my Reserve are a 6, 3 5s, a 4, a 2, and a 0.  I shuffle it a bit, and he cuts.  I CPI, and DRAW THE ZERO.  He spread to my sites to prevent further CPIing of Alderaan, having dropped OMDH targeting Wedge at Tatooine earlier on, but not having enough Force to pay for retrieval (I start Secret Plans; he was short 1 Force).  I have Palpatine battle EPP Leia, and he uses Run Luke, Run!, then Clashes Palpy, which I cancel with Crush The Rebellion.  That ends the game, leaving his differential much less than if he had pulled off OMDH.<br/>
Result: FL -23<br/>
Standing: 4(+45)<br/>
Good Things: None.<br/>
Bad Things: Early spies.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: Awesome play; he read my CPI and did exactly what one needs to do to counter it.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS v. Paul Feldman’s SYCFA<br/>
I didn’t get 8D8 for a long time.  During that time, he dropped M’iiyoom Onith on Zuckuss In Hunter and used her to rape me every turn.  I freed Leia and flipped, but that’s all I did.  He had started Secret Plans, and I was ONE card short on paying for the full retrieval.  He Reactor Terminal-ed his hand, and I picked up since I had nothing to do.<br/>
Result: FL -31<br/>
Standing: 4(+14)<br/>
Good Things: None.<br/>
Bad Things: M’iiyoom raping me.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: Feldman’s a great guy, and fun to play (even though I lose), and his retirement will bring down the fun level at these large tournaments Alderaan always has running in it.  Good luck to you, sir!<br/>
<br/>
2-2 again; and again, I’m not to thrilled.  I immediately add Goo Nee Tay to my RTP deck to prevent another M’iiyoom rape.<br/>
<br/>
CONCLUDED IN 3-10-01 ENDURO 4th Quarter<br/>
