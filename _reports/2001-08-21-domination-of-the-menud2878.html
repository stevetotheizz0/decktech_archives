<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">HEy this is eric hunter reporting form mass on a tournament... There where 10 people there.. WEll on to the pre game junk.<br/>
<br/>
Well anyway i had gone playtesting the week before with my bro before he left... i just kept my wys and made a maul mains.. senate was crap for both sides so i just made a few changes to get around a few things. Anyway i got up ate pop tarts, then headed out with my dad who played golf all day. we got there and i saw mike gemme, mike pistone, and basicly a bunch of locals. anyway onto the games...<br/>
<br/>
game 1 vs.. don’t remember ur name senate.<br/>
anyway i set up and start draining. he did stuff in senate and that’s it.. he basicly did nothing i was draining for like 6 a turn and he darined for one and he activated 9 force tops all game... he brought some stuff down but i just beat it away. fw by 26<br/>
<br/>
highs: winning<br/>
lows: none<br/>
<br/>
so anyway after this game i find mike gemme was also done. so we head to wendys, when we get there we find a HOT girl working the register.. i go up and say to mike. "watch this"... i go and and order a jr. bacon cheesburger, 5 peice chicken nuggets, medium fries and coke. it came to a total of 4.19. i payed and said that was domination. then sat down and started eating.. anyway he goes up starts jedi test number 1! He says hi and smiles, and orders combo number 6 or sumthing, i didn’t really see what else he did but he talked for a little bit, we got the food ate and went back to the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
game 2 vs random jabroni number 2 playing rst.<br/>
i got maul out and elised him to the bunker to drain for 1 all game.. i got out mara and emperor to help out maul next turn and was drainng. he left endor and tried tat but vader and dr.e, vader, and p-59 joined his guys and i smacked him for 6 overflow. i just drained him out fom there. fw by 29<br/>
<br/>
highs: deck working<br/>
lows:none<br/>
<br/>
so anyway mike and i go back to wendys and i order from the 99 cents value menu.... a frosty, 2 chicken nuggets, and a sald. i get it for 4.19 and take the food and sit down again and start eating. anyway mike starts talking to the hot cashier there and i saw she was smiling and he was working jedi test number 2. he delpoyed on wendys and instead of her moving it, she made him come her to complete the test.<br/>
<br/>
game 3 vs mike schiemer hidden mains..<br/>
man i get maul out and 2 sites... he just activates and gets more db’s and systems out. i activate and drain then draw a couple. he comes down with a frozen assets but i alter it. he just poops in his pants and i barrier the guy he palays next(he frozen, deploy, me alter, he dploy back up) so i barrier and then it’s my turn. i sniper. deploy p-59 and p-60 and battle. i have u now, swing and hit, shoot and hit once, u lose 1.. i draw 4 destiny(it was luke) he loses luke and 9. i love a droid. i then move my droid over to drain for 3 a turn. he deploys to space to set up omdh. i just drain and draw guri and stinger! i come down next turn. batle with guri, stinger, zuckuss. he loses everything. so now i am draining for 5 a turn and he just draws.. in a matter of turns i drian em out though he tried to mount a comback.<br/>
<br/>
highs: my deck<br/>
lows:none<br/>
<br/>
so again we go back to wendys...  i order 4 things from the 99cent value menu and smile at the cashier saying domination. i go sit down and mike goes and works his magic. he smiles and says some stuff to her and he gets a laugh... text book test number 4. he finishes and i am done leaving the people who waited in line angry for with my domination and his jedi testing the entire wendy’s is estatic.<br/>
<br/>
game 4 vs mike pistone<br/>
we just play it out and well, he has never beaten my deck and i win by 25.<br/>
<br/>
highs: none<br/>
lows:none<br/>
<br/>
i win the tourney ..yah!<br/>
<br/>
so anyway this time we go to wendy’s and i did enough domination, but i still get a frosty. he goes up bam! test 5 and 6. we walk out and he flashes me the phone number and we go back to the card hall. on the way there we see chris colgojline and bottomly making out and doing all this weird @#$%, we are just shocked and move past. god they was going at it like rabbits. so anyway we get back and my dad is there so he takes me home and on the way we run over 2 people passed out on the road. i tihnk it was cgolon and bottomly.. i don’t know... whatever.<br/>
<br/>
morale of the story.<br/>
dominate the 99cent value menu every chance u get.<br/>
jedi testing. try it.<br/>
<br/>
that’s all. </font></td>
