<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I was not going to write this report because I thought it would come across as too complaining; but I think I am over it now. It's actually kind of funny. So here comes my tail of woe:<br/>
<br/>
My decks:  <br/>
Light side Tosche Mains and Toys <br/>
Dark side Hunt Down w/no dueling<br/>
<br/>
'If I only had a brain...'<br/>
1st Game: My Dark Side against Steve Brentson MWYHL w/no testing<br/>
Tight game. I was outplayed. I had trouble finding a Vader (got to put one more into this deck) Steve put Bousch undercover early at my drain site where I had Mara and her Saber. I waited patiently to get some good destiny stacked and at the end of his turn, when we both lost force to Visage, I did not want to lose from the top because of my stacked destiny. So, thinking I was throwing away an Evader, I tossed the Sniper I had been holding patiently into the lost pile. I did not notice this extremely clever move until my control phase when I triumphantly went to play it and found an Evader instead -- too much water under the bridge to take it back. I told Steve what I had done. He said, 'I wondered about that.' This was a damn close game. Steve thought I might have won it if I had Snipered Bousch. As it was, Full Loss ~10.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Playing Steve. I love to play against the best players.<br/>
Lows: Duh...<br/>
<br/>
'That doesn't sound very wise to me...'<br/>
2nd Game: My Light Side against Brian Ciezynski's Tatooine Mains<br/>
Another of the region's top players. Brian and I have played many times. This game is a bit of a haze to me. I remember he had a very difficult time finding his locations and I did not. I was seriously out-sacked but it did not matter. There was an interesting rules question that came up. I had Wise Advice in play. He grabbed an interrupt of mine with There'll Be Hell To Pay and then Sensed it. My position, naturally, was that the interrupt went back to the used pile because the Wise Advice game text would supercede normal usage. The majority viewpoint was that interrupts always stay on the grabber. I'm still not sure I'm wrong. In most cases specific game text supercedes the rules. I know the rule on the grabber is that the card stays there even if it is cancelled but I assumed that the Wise Advice game text, which specifically sends the card to the used pile, would take precedence. Anyway, tough game for Brian. Full win ~+25<br/>
<br/>
Highs: beating Brian<br/>
Lows: watching Brian's frustration at not getting his stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
'As time goes by...'<br/>
3rd Game: My Dark Side against Shaun McCarthy Hidden Base...<br/>
Well anyone who has played me knows that I am a slow and deliberate player. If you want to know why, read the account of game 1. But there is a player whose slowness I am not worthy to measure -- Shaun. This game was agonizing. It took me a long time to get a Vader in hand (yup definitely need one more). So for a while he is getting systems out and I am getting sites down and drawing like mad for a Vader. Of course, when I get him deployed, Shaun plays a Trans. Terminated. We battled in space and on the ground. I don't think he ever did flip the objective. This game had me in the driver's seat the whole way but with both of us counting our piles and agonizing over discards (you better believe I looked at each card twice before I put into the lost pile!!!) we were nowhere near the end when time was called Timed win ~+17<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Well it was better than game 4 was going to be<br/>
Lows:  Playing the one guy in the region who takes longer than me to decide what cards to toss.<br/>
<br/>
'It's still the same old story...'<br/>
4th Game My Light side against Shaun McCarthy Hunt Down with Dueling<br/>
This was the timed game from hell. Now this was Hunt Down versus Tosche Mains and Toys. How the hell can this be a slow game? I drew for a couple turns to get my anti dueling cards before deploying Luke and Obi. He took a few turns before deploying Vader. I got Jeroen and Tawss onto the Executor to cancel the Visage. He had Coward in play, so I tried to get Kessel and Toschi Station set up so I could drain. We did a lot of battling back and forth at the station. Including one battle that went on for so long ('I'll play this interrupt...no wait a minute. I'll shoot. No I'll play the interrupt first I guess. Now who has the next action?') that, by the time we reached the end of the weapons phase, we both forgot who initiated the battle. Literally. I insisted that it was his turn just so that we could get on with things but really, I had no clue. It was too close to call until I played an Out of Commission and bagged Vader. Now I just had to kill the Vader on the table and that's it. So I put my lightsaber guys down with Vader and hit him. With Vader out of play, Shaun had nothing left. It was just a matter of me draining but he was going slowly and his force pile was still bigger than mine. Now I started to lose my temper because I knew he had nothing left. I also knew he wouldn't draw up. Sure enough time was called while he still had more force. Timed loss ~-14.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: What???<br/>
Lows: Guess who is riding home with me...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually I don't get angry often and I get over it quickly. Shaun and I had a pleasant drive back to town.  We avoid talking about timed games, however. <br/>
<br/>
Steve Brentson won the tournament. I have no idea where anyone else finished. I got a Zuckuss foil for a prize. I gave it to some kid.  <br/>
<br/>
Props &amp; Slops <br/>
Not this time. I guess props always go to the TD and the host. <br/>
