<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">So Kris Earle makes this real elaborate plan to do 2 days of SWCCG here in Massachusetts.  I think cool, gotta get to that.  So I make plans with Mike Hawley to split a room at the Holiday Inn where the tournament is going to be being held.  Cool.<br/>
<br/>
For decks i am playing a WYS beats and a Huntdown I came up with.  So I pay my enterance and get a free shirt, it is green and shows lando on the front.  Wow.  Mike Gemme shows up and I hook him and Eric Hunter up with some raw deal cuz the two of them, Hayes Hunter and Steve Baroni all decided to go play in a Raw Deal tournament instead because it is cheaper.  Well more people stroll in, notables include Steve Brentson, Andy Klema, Justin Desai and a few others.  <br/>
<br/>
We have like an hour, so I trade cards with Alex Shulman and he asks me if I want to play a game for fun, so he pulls out two decks and I use his RST and he uses a CPI deck.  His CPI is slow, the RST is fast, i totally dominated the game, with the exception of a few bad destiny attempts to blow up the bunker slowing me down, i ended up beating him with it by like 15 or so.<br/>
<br/>
We get underway, the Captains are picked, Justin Desai, Steve Brentson and Rick Gaudioso.  I end up getting picked 9th by Rick Gaudioso, and our team consisted of: Rick, myself, Paul Maholick, Erik Markarian and like 3 others, one of which I had never met before but was actually pretty good.  So we get set to play.  At this point they change it to a 4 game tournament instead of a 6 game which pisses everyone off because this is the only sanctioned constructed event the whole weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Rating going in: 1609 (76 games played)<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
My WYS vs. Ben Rodriguez (1675) Endor Ops<br/>
<br/>
Well the timer starts and we sit down to play and I count my deck real fast as does he.  He counts his to 61, so he recounts and gets 61 again.  He recounts it twice more, once going one at a time.  We conclude he has 61 but i’m not gonna be a prick so I let him take a card out which takes like another 2 minutes.  So we finally get underway, I get a good start setting up at Kessel with 2 ships by turn 2.  He kept coming up with star destroyers and dudes to forfeit on it but I knew I would eventually take the system because his destiny draws are not making me lose anything.  He comes down with Dengar in Punishing One that forces me to start forfeiting stuff, but once he ran away from kessel and i threw dudes down to the cantina and he had nothing to battle them with I knew I had the game under control, so I drew a few looking for my On The Edges to boost my differential, as soon as I do this time rings.  He gets a timed win cuz he had 11 in his deck and i only had 7 at that point, but he was only draining me for 1 and i was draining for 6.  I plead my case to the TD about the fact that he took so long counting his deck in the beginning which he admitted to, but the TD would not side with me so I get the gay timed loss when I was gonna win in 2 turns.<br/>
<br/>
0 -11<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Knowing I should have won.<br/>
Lows: Not winning when I should have won.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
My Huntdown vs. Andy Klema (1925) Dagobah Hit and Run<br/>
<br/>
Ok well I lose so I get to play one of the best players there.  Great.  Well he had a brilliant deck, which just decimated me.  He starts MWYHL, Podracing and for an effect, Draw Their Fire.  I get good start with and Endor drain 2 site and Vader.  He starts the podrace, I draw low so I just send it to my used pile.  So I drop vader and the site down first turn and flip, he has no answer for Visage the whole game.  His turn he gets a Dagobah site, inserts anger fear aggression lets me go.  Podrace etc. this game is pretty straight forward and can be explained easily, he played 8 anger fear aggressions in his deck, he inserted it 4 times.  This and the podrace dealt me mega damage and he kept coming down with epps and using jedi’s resiliance to get them back.  He OOC’d Vader and then killed him with an Epp so I had to eat Visage, he played like a champ and beat me with a great deck.<br/>
<br/>
0 -15, so now i’m 0 -26, great<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Playing a great player<br/>
Lows: Not being able to beat his deck<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
My WYS vs. Tom Nota (1539) ???<br/>
<br/>
I honestly forget what he was playing and every detail of this game.  All I know is the beats did their job and I crushed his deck.  <br/>
<br/>
2 +23 so now i’m 2 -3<br/>
<br/>
Highs: The Beats!<br/>
Lows: He never saw it coming<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My Huntdown vs. Chris Cieslik (1577) TIGIH Scouts with NO SITES!!!<br/>
<br/>
Having no sites sucks.  I grabbed Luke and he couldn’t flip me back.  I took over endor and drained him to death, he had a little drain going at the death star for a while but i got stuff to stop that, he really didn’t have a chance, I give him props for sticking it out and trying to battle with the scouts, even though he didn’t get the combos he needed.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2+17  so i finish 4 + 14<br/>
<br/>
Well our team finishes in last, oh well I got a Jar-Jar squirt toy lol.  So after this, there is a Reflections booster draft but I decline to spend 15 bucks on it, cuz I need to save some money.  So I playtest a game with Steve Anderson using my decks and I kill my WYS with my Huntdown cuz he had no clue how to play it.<br/>
<br/>
I then went in the other room and playtested a game with Paul Maholick, he used WYS and they totally beat my Huntdown deck by like 15 I think.  Then we took a look over my deck and fixed some holes in it, and Justin Desai came over to help me with it more, thanks a lot guys for your input.<br/>
<br/>
I playtested the kid who was on my team that I had never met before but was pretty good and we had an AWESOME game, his ROPS kept coming back against my WYS and the game could have gone either way and he outplayed me and edged the win by 5.  It was a totally GREAT game, and dude if you review this, tell me your name we gotta playtest again sometime.<br/>
<br/>
So at this point I am bored and go up to my room and throw my @#$% down there.  I watch some Nicole Kidman movie where she is on this boat and someone is stalking her, it was pretty cool.  Then at like 11 or so i start working on my Endor/DS2 closed environment decks for the next day and Eric and Hayes come up to my room to give me back the Raw Deal stuff they borrowed and make some trades, then Mike Hawley comes up, we do some trades and put finishing touches on my decks.  He goes to sleep and I put on the TV to watch a movie.  So it’s now like 12:00 at night so I’ll pick up from here in my day 2 report tomorrow, which will include props and slops. </font></td>
