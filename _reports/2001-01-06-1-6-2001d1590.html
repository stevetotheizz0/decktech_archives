<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">today in Normal, Illinois we played a really fun tournament.  it was fun.  did i mention that it was fun?  my big new deck for the day was "bloodspeaker."  for any of you that don’t know what this deck is, check out my member page.  so there were only 8 people.<br/>
<br/>
myself, bret, bob, james, tyler, ryan, joe, and that’s it.  so we ran with a bye (if that’s how you spell bye).<br/>
<br/>
game 1) bloodspeaker unicorns vs. ryan’s wasp ninjas w/abandoning<br/>
<br/>
i get a monster first turn w/inheritance, taeruko, restoring the doji treasury.  i pull mastersmith from my dynasty deck, and on his turn pull empty crevasse.  i eventually get lots of personalities out, and using KuniYori exp3 i steal his dead shapeshifters and Aramoro’s and he finally gets hit with his own "abandoning."  i eventually take all 4 provinces.<br/>
<br/>
game 2) vs. bret’s corrupt military spirits<br/>
<br/>
i go first and get taeruko, crevasse, then he goes and get akuma, sagoten.  tomb of jade for akuma, but then i stall out and keep getting gold while bret brings in more guys and pulls favor control with sagoten.  i have 0 military defense, and so bret takes 4 provinces in around 5 turns time.  <br/>
<br/>
game 3) vs. james’ toturi’s army weenie swarm<br/>
<br/>
again i go first and pull monster god/personalities by about turn 3 (after playing taerukos and rise x2).  blessings of isawa allow me to attach wind’s truth to taeruko, and slowly dishonor james.  i take control of Nakao w/2 followers, and then start taking provinces. at this point, i’m down to 2 provinces, but james stalls out with alot of gold and only 1 dude in play (ginawa non-exp).  so i take favor control and his last 2 provinces.<br/>
<br/>
game 4) vs. joe’s ONI’s/p-kill<br/>
<br/>
joe is running oni madness w/ 3x kolat master and 3x kolat assassin, 3x ambush, and some other stupid stuff.  his gold is monstrous, but my first hand has 3x force of will, so i’m safe for a bit.  i finally get out some guys, and since i have 12 cards in my fate deck that auto-kill corrupt decks, i smoke him like a cuban.  (tomb of jade/darkness beyond darkness/force of will/test of honor)<br/>
yay i beat him. great. so at this point, everyone in 1st place (yes there are 3 of us) have played each other.  joe beat bret, bret beat me, and i beat joe.  great.  end tournament.<br/>
<br/>
other decks in the tournament:  ninja super abandoning w/30 personalities, phoenix shiba halls dragons.  i think my deck was the coolest, but it usually just gets smeared by speed military.  since this was the "strict jade" format, i thought that maybe i’d do a bit better since alot of people just run for an honor victory or try to pull of enlightenment (both of which i’m running cards to stop).<br/>
<br/>
tech cards of the day:  <br/>
<br/>
Bloodspeaker’s Deal<br/>
Occult Murders<br/>
Master Smith<br/>
Bleeding the Elements<br/>
<br/>
fun stuff<br/>
