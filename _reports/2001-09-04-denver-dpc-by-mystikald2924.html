<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Pre-tourney stuff: I am trying to figure out what decks to use and Tim Guzman says DS Senate is good, and for light use WYS of course. Then I talk to Ted Hansen and he says use AOTBS for dark and I say, YEAH! So Matt Berta loans me 3 Emperor Palpatine (that is how you say it in plural, trust me) and Shane Watner also loans me 3 Palpatine. I build a deck based from what David Irvine played in Vegas DPC and I add some Coruscant to make it good. My WYS is pretty standard. Same Ol @#$% with celebration for retrieval. OK? I don’t remember a couple f the guys I played and for that  am truly sorry, but I had been up since 11 am on friday and it was 10 am saturday and I was kinda tired. There were only 27 people so that sucked, but I don’t really care, ok? Anyway, on to the carnage or whatever...<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 AOTBS vs. Danny Hummel (I am pretty sure)<br/>
He starts with QMC and I am happy coz that means I instantly win. Any deck that gives up an Icon means I get Palpy down and flip in 1 turn. I draw my hand, and smile. I deploy Palpy to the Guest Quarter and move Xizor to Coru: DB and flip. He Squadasses to get Dash to Bespin after getting out his site. I drain, make him lose 2 and I deploy Guri with Xizor. Check my force pile and draw to get my Lateralus Damage. He goes and drains and tries to fight Emperor but is put in his place with some fatty destiny. On My turn I come with Fett in S1 vs. a damaged Outrider but he barriers. Oh well. His turn, he puts EPP Luke at a site to flip me back. and he says go. I deploy Angry IG-88 in front of Luke on a suicide deal. I end up capturing him and flipping back. I check my destiny and fight Outrider. It dies horribly and I win the game. <br/>
FW +24<br/>
<br/>
Good: The deck is a damn machine.<br/>
Bad: Not a Whole lot. I mean, when Iggy captures Luke when you are playing AOTBS you are in a virtual heaven.<br/>
<br/>
So my high differential puts me higher than I like to be at this point but hey, WTF! I have to fight Hayes.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 WYS vs. Hayes Hunter<br/>
He has Hunt Down and I am a little bothered by it. I can’t seem to get by Hunt Down ever. So his first turn consists of Ozzel at the Exe: DB, Lord Vader w/saber there too and a transit to my DB on Tatooine. Great... O have hardly any dudes in my hand. And I have to draw stuff. So I am losing to Visage, getting drained, and drawing no guys. I finally get a Luke out there but Maul dispatches him and I get obliterated. <br/>
FL by 27 or so. I forgot the exact #.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Huh?<br/>
Lows: My @#$% hurts. That was a horrible game and I now have no confidence in my light deck. <br/>
<br/>
So I get smacked but oh well. Move on right?<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 WYS vs. Chris Fanchi<br/>
He’s Playing the Watto objective and I am like, MAN! So basically, he would get Watto out, deploy a guy to Mos Espa, make me lose my 2 and move over to the Junkyard. I had yet another slow start. I didn’t really get much going until the middle of the game. I managed to fight for a bit, but he had a ton more characters than me. Eventually my dudes run out and he wins by 5 or so. I don’t remember alot of details from this game coz I was a little down from my previous game. Sorry folks.<br/>
FL by 4<br/>
<br/>
Highs: what? oh yeah, I played a game huh...<br/>
Lows: remember the last one I told you about?<br/>
<br/>
Alright, this was starting to suck but I promised the Vegas crew I wouldn’t drop. <br/>
<br/>
Game 4 AOTBS vs. the redheaded kid (Dmail me if you read this man)<br/>
I dont know this guys name, sorry. He started the EBO setup and then the game was over. He gave me an Icon. I draw but no Emperor. So I deploy DB and move, phlip, and check pile. Draw my Guri and Emperor. He gets out a site and EBG. He says go. I drain, make him lose mandatory force and put emperor at 4th marker coz I have control in hand. He gets out some echo sites and puts Comm. Luke at the hoth DB. I drain make him lose force, put out DS DB and a couple of presence of the forces and a vigo, send the guri/Xizor/vigo to the DS DB. I continue the onslaught of damage and drain as he finally gets up the EBO and an xwing to hoth. I kill it with a @#$% and move to some other system he had out. He tried to fight back, but a lateral damage and Bossk felt that was unnecessary. I win handily by 33.<br/>
FW by 33.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: this deck rox. Plus it is carrying me.<br/>
Lows: beating this kid by so much. if it weren’t an important tourney I would have calmed down a bit. <br/>
<br/>
So I trade with him in a trade that was severely to his favor so I feel a little better. I gave him Coruscant Qui-Gon, foil Janus, and a couple of other cards for AI Sen. Palpatine and Panaka. Anyway, on to game 5.<br/>
<br/>
AOTBS vs. a dude’s QMC.<br/>
He was Danny Hummel’s friend, so I knew this was in the bag. No offense, what I mean is, they had the same deck. QMC. I setup fast and he doesn’t. Emperor fights alot and I keep deploying new ones when his sabers finally strike. So it comes down to 2 separate battles to end this game. I have Palpy and Iggy at the CC site where I can cancel drains. some sort of corridor. Iggy is escorting Kal Fal. He deploys JK Luke and I force Lite him used. Grabbed. then comes EPP Han. Battle. Anakin’s saber hit palpy. I play I Have You now. Iggy gets shot. I send luke to used pile and then Jabba Is Through With You. He goes to draw destiny and I call for a ruling coz you know that the destiny adding is an automatic thing , not a declarable thing. I draw well and he loses Han and a bunch. then I Damage his Outrider on my turn, send Zuckuss and Fett to handle him and redeploy an emperor to the drain cancel corridor. Dash dies horribly. and that is game.<br/>
FW by 27.<br/>
<br/>
highs: you know.<br/>
Lows: the emperor kept getting hit. WTF?<br/>
<br/>
So I have to play Van Melancon now. whomever wins this game will be in the top 4. I have to use the sitty @#$%in WYS...<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs. Van Melancon<br/>
He starts with the Maul site and Jabba’s Palace. He gets maul down and pulls a site and moves maul to JP. I deploy Dash in ship to tatooine and Phylo and wedge to my DB and flip. He says Recoil in fear, I say is it attached to sense? He says yeah and I go, NO! So he tries to drain but It’s A Hit. He moves maul back to landing site so he can hopefully get over to my guys. I deploy Menace fades, and I’ll take the leader and another smuggler to the docking bay. Then I pretty much run from where he is and drain where I go. We have a couple of cantina battles where I seem to keep the advantage. Eventually I take over the planet and drain him out. Full win by 17.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: MY WYS WON A GAME!!!!!! WOW!!!<br/>
Lows: Not much. I drew a good hand for once.<br/>
<br/>
So I ask around and find out that if Hayes beats Kyle Craft then I am in at 4th place. I wait a few minutes and Hayes beats Kyle and I am in. The only downside is I have to face Hayes again. Oh well, 4th isn’t THAT bad. I only think this because he slaughtered my deck earlier and you know that he’s gonna pick that same matchup. I asked if he wanted to play my dark, but he plays it safe.<br/>
<br/>
Bonus Game 1: WYS vs. Hayes’s Hunt Down... again<br/>
This time I get a decent hand. He starts with Premiere vader and saber to my Cantina and Ozzel to the Exe: DB. I get Mirax to Tatooine and Wedge and Phylo to the docking bay and I get Honor out. He tries to drain but it is controlled. He gets out the Endor DB and No Escape so Visage kicks back in. He puts the DS’ counterpart to Phylo at the Endor DB along with some other dudes. Janus also gets out pretty early and begins engineering my eventual demise. I get some drains in, and draw some cards. He rounds up his guys at my DB and forces me to run away to the cantina. I eventually get EPP Luke and EPP Han to the Endor DB. He counters with Maul, but Han shoots him and the site ands up cleared but Mauls ship sits on tatooine. He was supposed to live and over take Tatooine. Yay for me. So I am draining steadily in the cantina and in Space. Then everything begins to go wrong. He Lateral Damages Mirax and deploys chimaera, and sends up Mauls’ ship with Ozzel at the helm and Thrawn shuttles to his ship. I bring in Dash in the Outrider, and a Bantha droid to the hoth DB. Cancel the damage, and fight. He draws enough to kill Mirax. I kill Thrawn. He drains and stuff and fights some more and after a bit I am kicked out of space. My Battle Plan begins to hurt me and the game slips away. Loss by 7.<br/>
<br/>
So I get 4th which is good. I find out that I gave the best fight against Hayes, as he proceeded to destroy everyone that he played. The top 4 are, in order:<br/>
1) Hayes Hunter<br/>
2) Brian Hunter<br/>
3) Josh Bader<br/>
4) Dan Christy :)<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for forgetting so much, but I was REALLY tired and it was a busy weekend for me.<br/>
<br/>
