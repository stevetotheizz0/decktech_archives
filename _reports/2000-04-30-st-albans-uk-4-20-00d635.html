<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok...The preface, if you don't want to read it and are content with living your life blowing goats skip ahead:<br/>
<br/>
I get back from nationals, and am very happy with my performance and decide to get back into the game some. But I have spring break and decide the need to go places with hot girls is better than staying in my room listening to metal playing with paper. Let's just say I made the right decision...Anyways my relatives from the states come into visit which means I am locked up for the weekend, well so I thought. Mat Allen calls me the night before, and asks if I want to  go to the tourney. I tell him I can't but should ask. I go downstairs and ask, and to my surprise I can go. The night before as I go through my masssive rare folder, I see Uncontrollabe Fury and deicide to but some of that Motzeralla into my deck. I 'read some magazines' and watch some TV pretty late and go to bed around 1. In the morning I pack my bag and my dad takes me to Mat's. I have 2 nutra grain bars and make a sandwhich. MMM food. We get to the house and right away me and Mat leave. The car ride was pretty long and unevntful, and about as much fun as jerking off while thinking of a pregnant hermie nun...<br/>
<br/>
Decks:<br/>
<br/>
LS: Mains, Throne Room, started off as '...beating of a lifetime'<br/>
<br/>
DS: ROPS: kinda like Akkesons, some special mods...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:<br/>
<br/>
My DS VS Pete Dibiasio's MWYHL/space/odds<br/>
<br/>
Well, Pete and I play about every tournament, and split most of the time. He starts no effect, me IAO. I get a good hand, and churn out some 2/0 goodness early. R2 is deployed to the swamp and I figure he is running numbers. He continously deploys Dagobah sites, and gets the Holotable running. I flip with 3 Imps, and deploy an ATST and move 2 together. He deploys an Arcona and I trample it eventually. Numbers pops and I lose some, but not too much. He gets quite a fleet amassed as do I and we have a major battle up at Ralltirr. He kills off Zuckuss and Power Pivots the Devastator, so I am out quite a good amount of cards. Search and Destroy comes out to do some damage, but he deploys guys around it. 2 spys go to a 2/0 site, and I follow with Ig-88. His drains in space, the light numbers, the holotable, and beatdown make it a game in his favor.<br/>
<br/>
FL- 14.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2- My LS VS James Murphy's TDIGWATT/big blue deck.<br/>
<br/>
I get a nudj, Obi, stick in hand. Search for Nudj, none there. He started IAO and the move around exterior site. First turn I deploy the nudj from hand and Obi-wan with his anal intruder to the CC site and start bending him over with drains. He gets out some CC silliness and I counter all that he does. I fight off all of his characters and track around destinies to my advantage. Easy win.<br/>
<br/>
Fw- 25<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS VS Katherine Finch's Endor mains/Destiny 7's<br/>
<br/>
She starts Chirpas Hut and Landing Site, me Ralltirr and IAO. I get a 2/0 and swamp out first turn. She puts EPP Han to my swamp. I get another 2/0 out and another generic site. I draw. Vader comes down and takes out han and a few cards. I flip Ralltiir, Drain at Kashyyk with ZIMH and Igar/Tempest 1 on Endor. She is losing cards quickly. She deploys some mains on Endor and I wipe them out with IG88, Vader, Tarkin and some random ATST. Drain her out.<br/>
<br/>
FW- 27<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LS VS Pete Dibiasios TDIGWATT/big blue<br/>
<br/>
I get a good hand and get some 2/0s and draw into the falcon, leia, han and don't get @#$%y to go with my luke. I wait and activate and draw some. Bossk, Dreadnaught and Ozzel come to Bespin. I follow with the afforementioned cards and wipe all of them out, me losing none. I drain some and get out OTE. He gets another big big fleet goin in space and I am forced to retreat to CC. He puts Vader and Tarkin at the DB, next to where I landed the crew. I deploy Fury on Vader and the WHOLE mains crew moves over. I mean all of the mains. He decides he doesn't wanna lose the 5 so he battles. I hit both of them. Glancing Blow. Gift of the Mentor. Smoke Screen. Lose them and 20 more pls. Thanks for playing.<br/>
<br/>
FW- 23<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My DS VS Derek Hawkesworths OMDH/HB<br/>
<br/>
 I flip second turn with three ATST pilots and he gets some ships to Ralltirr and kills one with Boshek, flipping me back. I don't know why I was in such a rush to flip! Well anyways, he did his x-wing mains silliness and my objective flipped some and he power pivoted and blew up a ship and my ghhk was in deck so I had to lose like 20. He locked my down but he was a for sure win so didn't wanna screw me and just drained me out.<br/>
<br/>
FL- 12<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My LS VS Derek Hawkesworths Kashyyyk Ops<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Well I get another good draw, after drawing about 20 cards. He gets shuttles and ops and 2/2 imps to kashykk and I come with Luke/Han/Leia/Falcon/Don't get Cocky and wipe out most of it. He flips and I follow with Obi/stick and make him lose like 5. Land Falcon. Take over ground. Flip back. Drain. Drain. OTE. Thanks for playing<br/>
<br/>
FW-20+<br/>
<br/>
I end up around 8+ (72) and come in 4th. No prize support and another piece of $hit ride home. Oh well...<br/>

****A lot of this humor was just to make it interesting and isn't to be taken seriously*****<br/>
