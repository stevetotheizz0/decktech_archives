<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">     Rewind to the 20th. I talked to my friend Tim, and he said he could make it to the tourney on the next day. He needed to borrow some cards, which I’d give him the morning of the tourney. That night my sister lost her decks, so in a few minutes we threw together a couple decks for her. On the 21st, Tim comes over, me and Val are ready. I put a light jacket on, and put Mr. Ducky in my pocket. Mr. Ducky then pees in my jacket pocket. So now the jacket is soaked, and there’s this huge wet spot, so I didn’t wear the jacket. As punishment, Mr. Ducky would spend the whole tournament in my pocket. I feel like I’m forgetting something... I shake off the feeling, and we arrive. 12 people showed up for this 6-game Swiss tournament at Game Times, directed by Rich Dailey, who would not be playing in the actual tourney. Good... I always have to play him in every tourney we both play in, and he always beats me, but today he won’t be in my way. My mom had a dream the night before that I got second place. Knowing clairvoyance runs in my family, I’m starting to get confident. Let’s see what happens. For DS I’m playing My Kind Of Machine 5.0, MKOS Abyssins done my way, a couple modifications different from 4.0. For LS I’m playing Blue Cheese 2.0, a speeders/numbers deck like the original, but now a lot less cheesy.<br/>
<br/>
1st game: My LS vs. Frank Quillen’s DS Court<br/>
<br/>
     Great. I get to play against the guy everyone loves to hate, the player known to lie, cheat, steal, and all kinds of other stuff. He says he’s playing ROps, but then it turns out he’s not. Whatever. I start Endor: Rebel Landing Site (I get 2 icons, he gets one, my droids deploy -1 there), Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Aim High. He starts No Bargain, Power Of The Hutt, and Something Special Planned For Them. His first turn he deploys a bunch of Jabba’s Palace sites, my first turn I deploy ASP, some speeders, and an R2-X2. Now he realizes I’m playing speeders. So his turn he starts setting up at his interior sites. He also deploys Imperial Decree, even though he doesn’t have any rebel base sites in his deck, and only one system. My turn I try setting up on Endor, but Arica comes down at the Back Door. Ouch. Now I know what I forgot before the tournament... I forgot to put Revealed in my deck. Dang. He’s draining for about 10 at lots of different interior sites with Gailid, draining me at Tatooine system, and making me lose 3 to Occupation every turn... my numbers are doing damage, but not enough, and my speeders can’t go indoors. I’m only draining for 3. Late in the game I get a ruling for T-47 Battle Formation, can I use it if I have speeders at 3 different exterior Endor sites if all he has on Endor is an undercover Arica? My argument is that I still control the site, she doesn’t provide presence, she just prevents the drain. Of course Frank argues with that, but the ruling is in my favor, and I get to drain for 5 one turn. Doesn’t do me much good in the end... I lose by 14.<br/>
<br/>
0 (-14)<br/>
<br/>
Good: I get to win my next game.<br/>
Bad: I’m starting to have doubts about my LS.<br/>
Ugly: Frank’s mom.<br/>
<br/>
     After the game me and Frank argued about various things. He lost every single rulings argument we had, and lost every one of his arguments for the rest of the day too. Pairings announced, I’m up against Dum Dum.<br/>
<br/>
2nd game: My DS vs. John Gardiner’s LS MWYHL<br/>
<br/>
     If you want to find out why we all call him Dum Dum, read my Greenwood <br/>
1-20-01 report. I start MKOS stuff, Power Of The Hutt, First Strike, and Secret Plans. We both get off to a quick start, he’s completing his tests as fast as possible, I’m draining for 3 (if it weren’t for test 1 I’d be draining for 6). Early on I notice him losing Old Times, Proton Torpedoes, the Trench, and other Attack Run stuff. Turns out he’s running Attack Run, which would be fun if he ran up against a SYCFA deck. He comes down to Tatooine with Crix Madine and some scout scrub. I come down with Dr. E &amp; Ponda Baba, Snoova w/Ax, and Bib. I battle, Scum is out, so I retrieve 3 he loses 1. I swing at Crix with the Ax. I draw a 0, the only one in my deck. He draws a blind seven. Snoova just smacked himself with his own ax. Everyone at the table bursts out laughing. My destiny is enough to clear the site, his destiny makes me lose Bib. A turn later he gets Colonel Cracken Undercover at my Audience Chamber with Han’s Heavy Blaster Pistol. Next turn he used Sorry About The Mess, targeting Gailid. He just needs a one to kill Gailid. He draws a 0. We all laugh again, this is a funny game. Cracken did manage to shoot him later, though. Dum Dum tried deploying Jedi Luke w/saber alone to a site. I deployed 4-LOM, EPP Boba, Mighty Jabba, Ephant Mon, and maybe someone else or 2. Luke’s text is canceled, Luke slices someone, I get 4 destinies and their each +2, Dum Dum’s destiny is a blind 7, again. Dum Dum loses Luke and some, I lose Ephant and the guy who got sliced. From there I just drain him out. Win by 34.<br/>
<br/>
2 (+20)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Great game, funny game, won by a lot.<br/>
Bad: Snoova excluding himself.<br/>
Ugly: Cracken missing Gailid at point blank range.<br/>
<br/>
     Pairings are announced, I’m up against Aaron Clay.<br/>
<br/>
3rd game: My DS vs. Aaron Clay’s LS Kessel space deck<br/>
<br/>
     I’ve seen Aaron before, this is his third tourney. I feel sorry for the poor kid, he’s kind of a newbie (but by no means the newbiest person here), and I know I’m going to win. I’ll try to be gentle. He starts Kessel, and, um, I dunno what else. I’m not even sure if he started any other effects. I started the usual. My first turn I deploy Audience Chamber, Jabba’s Sail Barge (to Tatooine: Jabba’s Palace), and the Passenger Deck from Reserve. His turn he deploys 3 systems from hand (!), then deploys Melas and Wedge Antilles, Red Squadron Leader to Tatooine: Jabba’s Palace. He’d asked me if he could battle the vehicle, the answer is no, but he deploys there anyway. My turn, forget about being gentle. I deploy Snoova w/Ax, Mercenary Pilot, and another guy or two. I battle, exclude Wedge, draw 2 high destinies, he loses Melas and some. At this point he realizes he has no chance of winning against me. So we make a deal. He wants to play Dum Dum, since he loses on purpose. I just want to win. So on his turn he does absolutely nothing, and says he wants me to win by as much as possible. My turn I Twi’lek for Reactor Terminal, his turn, he does nothing. My turn I put my hand back with the Terminal and drain for 60 (drain for one, his turn, does nothing, my turn, drain for 1, bur since that’s all we were doing, I just said "drain for 60" and that’s all I needed to do). Win by 41.<br/>
<br/>
4 (+61)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Winning by a lot.<br/>
Bad: Having to slaughter a newbie, even if he wanted to lose.<br/>
Ugly: 41 is a lot.<br/>
<br/>
     After the game I give him as many tips as I can. Later I trade him some stuff, including a Chewbacca Of Kashyyyk he needed (he had no Chewie). He gets his wish, he gets to play Dum Dum when the pairing are announced. I get to play Daniel Davis. Oh boy...<br/>
<br/>
4th game: My LS vs. Dan Davis’ DS TIEs<br/>
<br/>
     He hates me. I’ve played him once, and I was kicking his butt until he quit. He starts Kuat, Mobilization Points, Secret Plans, and something else. I start the usual. I get an absolute god hand, getting 2 droids (ASP-707 and R2-X2), 2 NTMTOs, 2 speeders, and Incom Corporation. His turn he deploys Wakeelmui, my turn. I deploy the 2 droids, insert Odds (he isn’t happy about that), deploy 2 speeders to ASP’s site, deploy Hoth: Echo Docking Bay from Reserve, deploy Incom Corp, his turn. While activating, Odds pops up, he loses 7. He deploys Kiffex, uses Imperial Command to get Chiranaeu (doesn’t deploy him though), my turn. I deploy Back Door, Artoo and a couple speeders there, insert Odds, his turn. He activates, loses 13 to Odds, and quits the game. He never deployed a single TIE. I win by 35.<br/>
<br/>
6 (+96)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Winning, I guess.<br/>
Bad: He always quits against me, that’s no fun.<br/>
Ugly: Losing 13 to Odds... ouch... and he never really did anything.<br/>
<br/>
    After the game he just stares at me and pulls out a 20-sided dice. I say "11," I roll the dice. 11 comes up. He stares at the dice, then stares at me. I try to say, "It’s called clairvoyance", but before I can finish he says, "Don’t talk to me." He’s obviously ticked off at me. Pairing are announced, I’m playing Karl. Crap.<br/>
<br/>
5th game: My LS vs. Karl Harford’s DS BHBM<br/>
<br/>
     His rating is like what, 1847 or something really close to that? And of course he plays BHBM, a deck I have problems with (not a good matchup for speeder/numbers). He starts 3 Effects, including YCHF, thus canceling my numbers. His turn he gets out Emperor’s Power, Emperor Palpatine, and a couple docking bays. My turn I manage to get out Hoth: Echo Docking Bay, Incom Corporation, an ASP droid, and a couple speeders to the Rebel Landing Site. His turn he deploys Mara to cancel Incom, deploys DVDLOTS to the speeders site, battles, uses Emperor’s Power to add a destiny, chokes ASP, I don’t get a destiny. I lose both speeders and a bunch. My turn I deploy Maneuvering Flaps and lose 3 to Your Destiny. His turn he drains for a few, backs up Vader with someone, my turn. I turn on Flaps, deploy an ASP droid and 4 speeders to Vader’s site, battle. Vader and his friend are lost. I have to lose all the speeders... but one. Crap. His turn he comes down with Ig-88 w/gun, Darth Vader, and some other guy. He battles, uses the Power, captures the droid, I lose the speeder and a bunch. Every time I deploy something he battles it and kills me, always drawing really high battle destinies, and I keep having lose Force to Your Destiny, and he’s draining for a lot. In the end he had 6 cards stacked on Insignificant Rebellion. It can’t go on like this... I lose by 21.<br/>
<br/>
6 (+75)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Losing against someone a lot better than me isn’t too bad, I guess.<br/>
Bad: Everything.<br/>
Ugly: This game wasn’t even fun, it sucked.<br/>
<br/>
     Last game pairings are announced, I’m up against Randy Barker.<br/>
<br/>
6th game: My DS vs. Randy Barker’s LS WYS<br/>
<br/>
     I’ve played Randy once before and got beat pretty badly. That loss happened to be my only loss at that particular tournament. Having never won against Randy, and the fact that he’s about 100 points higher rated than I am, makes me rather doubtful of a win. Until he reveals his Objective... Watch Your Step. I’ve never lost against WYS. Never. He starts Squadron Assignments, and some other junk. I start the usual. I quickly discover he’s playing heavy space. I also discover he doesn’t realize I play a lot of starships in my deck. I set up a drain of 6 that must come from Reserve (thanks Gailid and Mosep!) and he sets up a drain of 3 at Kessel, and a drain of 1 at Corellia. We just drain for a couple turns, I’m trying to draw starships. I get out Resistance, so the Kessel drain is reduced to 2. I also get out Search And Destroy, forcing him to deploy to Tatooine. He deploys Chewie w/Blaster Rifle and a Ralltiir Freighter Captain to the Cantina. Big mistake. I deploy J’Quille, EPP Boba Fett, and Mighty Jabba there. I battle, Scum is out, so I retrieve 3, he loses 1. J’Quille excludes Chewie. I’m telling you, J’Quille is the most under-rated character in the game. Sebulba sucks compared to him. Power 4 alien spy who can exclude characters of ability &lt;3, he’s just awesome. I shoot the RFC, he’s forfeit 0. I draw 3 destinies, each +2, each one at least a 3, thus each one is at least a 5. He loses the RFC and lots more. After the battle I use Jabba’s Twerps and retrieve 6 Force. His turn he makes another mistake by deploying Theron Nett on Red 10 alone at Ralltiir. He does remember to move Chewie away though. My turn I deploy Dengar In P1, Virago, and Stinger to Ralltiir. I battle Theron, retrieve 3, he loses 1, the only destiny he gets is to power. My destiny is +3, my power was already 11, he draws low. He loses Theron and the ship. I battle Chewie with someone just to get him off the table. Next turn I win by 12.<br/>
<br/>
8 (+87)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Winning against Randy.<br/>
Bad: Him draining at Kessel and Corellia for the whole game.<br/>
Ugly: J’Quille excluding Chewie is just so fun.<br/>
<br/>
     We got down fairly quickly, plenty of other games were still going on. After Aaron got done with his game, I traded him some stuff. Then I traded a grabber and Boba In Ship to some other kid for Japanese cards, 2 On The Edges, and other stuff. Results are announced... I got second! I’m definitely happy with that result. Karl won... if I would’ve won the game against Karl, I would’ve won the tourney. For prize support I got a D*II pack and a Reflections II pack. All I really got was Obi-Wan’s Journal, Jabba’s Sail Barge (in the Ref II pack, gave it to Aaron), and maybe something else. I traded Randy something for some more Japanese cards, then me and Frank raided the commons box (that often contains rares, fixed, premium, and japanese cards) for various stuff. I gave the DS Alter combo card to Aaron. A The Signal foil was given away at random, Aaron got it. Dan is still steamed at me... he pulls out his 20-sided dice again, with a look in his eyes that says "I dare you." I say "4", roll the die, it’s a 4. I’m not sure if Dan is ever gonna talk to me again. My mom arrives, and I tell her that the dream came true. Had a great time, lots of fun.<br/>
