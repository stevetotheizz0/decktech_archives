It was another freezing cold Sunday morning. I got up around  9:30 am. I left about 10:00am to call round for Elliott &amp;#8220;dengar 69&amp;#8221; weights and we got to the hall and most people were there. We got our sealed decks and 2 packets of cloud city and 1 pack of jabbas palace, the only good thing in the premiere packets was tatooine: obi wan`s hut, I didn`t use most of the stuff from cloud city, I stuck to space and tatooine ground sites. There were 9 players so every round someone was going to get a bye.                 I`ve shown my light side deck here because my dark side was really bad. <br/>

<br/>
Game 1 My DS &amp;#8211;vs- Matt hardy LS<br/>
I started with corulag and he started with the Lars moisture farm. The first few turns were mainly both of us drawing loads of cards; I deployed lieutenant tanbris, a jawa and a stormtrooper to the Lars moisture farm. I drained for a couple of goes while he was getting more cards. He setup his characters at the jundland wastes and put a vaporator there so he had a force drain of 3. He had quite a bit of power so I stayed where I was. He deployed kessel and a gold squadron y wing. I deployed officer evax and black 4 and obsidian squadron tie. He lost the y-wing. He had much more power than me on the ground, he stopped my force drains and I had a lone stromtrooper by himself, he deployed arleil schous, a corellian, a talz and, I lost the stromtrooper and 5 more damage, that finished me off.<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;6<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My DS &amp;#8211;vs- Ed`s LS<br/>
He started yavin 4. First turn I drawed all my cards because I had mostly interrupts. He saved his force and on his next turn he deployed red squadron x wing and gold squadron y wing and an x wing and a droid. I thought he`s taken the system for the rest of the game. I had activation of 3 because he put his light side corulag over mine, every single turn I kept drawing to get a ground location. It was so annoying I couldn`t get one. He deployed jundland wastes and about 7 characters, bo shek, talz, arcona, jek porkins, shistavanen wolfman and some other people, that was far too much power, I deployed officer evax and a obsidian tie to his y wing, he hyper escaped. He kept draining me for 3 every go, I drained for 1. In the end I had dreadnought and loads of ties, about power 20, he didn`t have the force to move his starships, I battled and he lost everything but a y-wing. I kept losing 2 force from the drain on the ground. I had both space locations under control, but by that time he finished me off with his force drain of 2.<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;11<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My DS &amp;#8211;vs- Jordan &amp;#8220;Rogue 2&amp;#8221; Thomas LS<br/>
I couldn`t believe I had to play dark side again, I`ve lost the last 2 games with it and he had won both of his games with his light side deck, I knew this was gonna be bad. He started with jundland wastes. I deployed the tusken canyon and chall bekan and a stromtrooper. His turn he picked his cards up and then I drained for 2 and this continued for the next 2 turns, he deployed figrin and a talz, arleil schous, a wolfman and a rebel trooper recruit, he battled and I drew a 4 for destiny and he drew a 2, I lost the strormtrooper and he lost figrin, but then played old ben to revive he back to life. Next turn I deployed lieutenant tanbris and a jawa to the jundland wastes and moved over chall bekan to the jundland wastes, he deployed another character to the jundland wastes and moved all of his other stuff to the jundland wastes. Every single turn he made a wager with figrin d`an and I lost it most times, due to him drawing a seven most goes which was strangle from jabbas palace, I won it twice over loads of goes he played it, he had a vaporator at the jundland wastes and drained me for 3, he spread out and I couldn`t beat him in the battle, at the tusken canyon we battled and I lost a character and a vehicle every go, he kept draining me for 3. In space I had a lone dreadnought. He deployed red squadron x wing and gold squadron y wing and a z-95 headhunter, he drew a 5 for battle destiny, I ended up losing the dreadnought and 6 more battle damage, he drained me for 3 on his next go and it was game over.<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;13<br/>
<br/>
That game was really bad for me, every turn he retrieved a force and 6 battle damage was bad, but it was a fun game though.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My LS &amp;#8211;vs- Elliot &amp;#8220;Dengar 69&amp;#8221; Weights DS<br/>
Finally I played my light side deck. I started with obi wan`s hut and he started with corulag. We both drew some cards in the first couple of turns. I put down the jundland wastes and put figrin d`an, rebel trooper, shistavanen wolfman with a mos eisley blaster and a kitonak. On his turn he deployed a dreadnought and a tie scout and I think an obsidian tie. I drained for 2 next turn. He drains for 1 at the tatooine system. Every turn I make a wager with figrin d`an, so when he drains I retrieve it. He deployed Lars moisture farm and reegesk and ugloste. I had a nabrun leids in my hand. Next turn I had about 12 force in my force pile because I`ve been saving it and I haven`t been drawing many cards. On my turn I drained for 2 and made a wager with figrin and won it. Then I played nabrun leids and it cost me 4 force, didn`t matter at all though, initiated battle and I fired my mos eisley blaster making reegesk forfeit minus 2 which is now 0. In the end he loses both of the characters plus 2 more force. He keeps draining me for 1 at the system and I keep retrieving 1. He deployed his jundland wastes over mine so I had a force drain of 1. I keep on draining him for 1. I didn`t pick up any cards for ages because I wan`t to keep my differential up. I finally drain him for his last 1 force.<br/>
FW +22<br/>
<br/>
I finally won a game and it was the biggest win in the tournament. Figrin d`an is one of the best cards in sealed deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 I had a bye.<br/>
So I had time to make changes to the deck. I knew I was playing light side again which is good. I brought a couple of reflections 2 packets for £1.50 each. <br/>
I am now on 4 (-8).<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 My LS &amp;#8211;vs- Carl &amp;#8220;Jode&amp;#8221; Jenner DS<br/>
I started off with obi wan`s hut like usual and he started with tatooine .On his turn he deployed tatooine: mos eisley, giving me more force generation. I had like the best cards in my hand that I needed. On my turn I deployed a kitonak and figrin d`an to mos eisley and I deployed the jundland wastes. He drew his cards on his next go. I drained for 2 and backed it up with a shistavanen wolfman with a mos eisley blaster. He deployed obsidian tie and Vader`s custom tie with a pilot to tatooine and a tie scout. My turn drained for 2 and made a wager, therefore retrieving 1 force. He deployed an imperial commander, stormtrooper cadet and a couple of power 1 characters. He didn`t battle because he used I force to move his imperial commander to obi wan`s hut. I was 2 sites away and I knew I couldn`t draw the nabrun leids and I didn`t have any characters in hand, so I had a drain of 3 against me for the next 2 turns. On his turn he battled, he had power 4 to my power of 4, I used my mos eisley blaster on his quarren which was ability 2 and I drew a zero so he didn`t have forfeit reduced. He drew a 3 and I drew a 5. He lost by 2 and forfeited the quarren and I lost figrin d`an, but I played old ben to revive him back. After that battle he moved his tie scout to corulag. My turn I made a wager and retrieved a force, I deployed a gold squadron y wing to his tie scout, I battled, he lost by 3 so he lost the scout. I battled on the ground and drew a 6 for battle destiny and he drew a 1. He lost all of his characters and I lost a kitonak. I moved my arcona to his imperial commander. On his turn he drained for 1, didn`t have any cards in his hand, he didn`t move his custom tie with pilot to where I was which I thought was a bit strange or maybe he just forgot. I drained for 2 and he played counter assault which I played it`s a hit to cancel it. I drained for 1 at corulag and 2 at the jundland wastes and that was the end.<br/>
FW+19<br/>
<br/>
So here are the final standings.<br/>
1ST place was Matt Hardy<br/>
2nd place was Jordan &amp;#8220;Rogue 2&amp;#8221;Thomas<br/>
3rd place was Elliot &amp;#8220;Dengar 69&amp;#8221; Weights<br/>
4th place was Me- Chris &amp;#8220;vader69&amp;#8221; Seymour<br/>
5th place was William Wood<br/>
6th place was Edward Bentley<br/>
7th place was Michael Bentley<br/>
8th place was Jacob keet<br/>
9th place was Carl &amp;#8220;Jode&amp;#8221; Jenner<br/>
<br/>
So that was the tournament finished and I finished 4th with 6 (+13). There was 2 draw prizes and I won the first won which was cool, it was a grimtaash foil and Elliott won the second one, which was a light side sense. This tournament was great fun and figrin d`an is the best.<br/>
