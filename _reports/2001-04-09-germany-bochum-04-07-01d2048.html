be warned !!!!<br/>
<br/>
Pretourny junk : After finally deciding to attend the SW<br/>
National Championship, which i was not sure about, because<br/>
i haven´t had a sanctioned SW tournament since the ´99<br/>
Ralltiir Regional, i now have three weeks to find two decks,<br/>
good enough to get me some wins.<br/>
<br/>
After talking to some Decktech members, who tell me not to<br/>
worry about my rating, and play stuff i know, i turn to my<br/>
friend Brian Hunter in advice for decks.<br/>
Some days later, i have narrowed down my list to two decks<br/>
each side : WYS or Hidden Mains for light, MKOS or Dark Deal<br/>
for Dark. I come to the conclusion, not to play WYS, since<br/>
i expect everyone to use it, and go with the HB Mains.<br/>
For Dark i end up with Dark Deal, seeing that my MKOS, while<br/>
very balanced, doesn´t as good as i hoped.<br/>
<br/>
So, after some playtesting, the day before the Nationals<br/>
arrives.<br/>
<br/>
Friday, 04/06/01 (evening) : I hurry arround and scramble<br/>
to get all my stuff together; get a hunch to include<br/>
Battle Plan instead of Kal Fal, but ultimatively decide<br/>
against it, because i am worried, that i won´t be able to<br/>
hold it with four ships (editors note : had i decided for<br/>
the Battle Plan, it would have helped in two games).<br/>
<br/>
But i decide on dumping Brangus for Xizor, which would<br/>
wound up to have no effect at all on my deck (didn´t deploy<br/>
Xizor all day).<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, 04/07/01 : I wake at four, get up at four thirty,<br/>
and manage to goof arround till five. Then i get to the bus,<br/>
which arrives shortly after.<br/>
<br/>
When i hit the next stop, where i am supposed to change bus<br/>
to get to the train-station, i realize, i am short on time,<br/>
because i will never make it in fifty minutes with a <br/>
conventional bus plus riding the tub to get my train at<br/>
6:21. So i get a cab - turns out to be a good decision;<br/>
now i can atleast have some coffee to get awake.<br/>
<br/>
The trip itself - it takes approximately four hours to <br/>
get to Bochum from Berlin (where i live) - is quite boring,<br/>
so i will spare you the details.<br/>
<br/>
However, i am able to find the place, where the Natioals<br/>
are going to be held, rather smoothly.<br/>
I reintroduce myself to the TD, who for some odd reason <br/>
seems to renember me from the ´99 Ralltiir Regional.<br/>
<br/>
I look arround, and see some new and some old faces; mainly<br/>
Bastian Winkelhaus (2134) - one of the two top-guns, and<br/>
as it turns out, Martin Falke (2099), eager to contest him<br/>
for the title, is there as well - before the tourney starts.<br/>
<br/>
We have a good turnout - there are 53 people participating,<br/>
including me ( i am the sole player from Berlin)<br/>
<br/>
-----End Pretourny Garbage---------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : Hidden Mains vs. Endor Ops<br/>
<br/>
I start Menace Fades, next to Insurrection,Staging Areas.<br/>
<br/>
The first few turns we just activate, i get out my docking<br/>
bays, as well as Dagobah, the Hut and Corulag (as i would do<br/>
every light game), then he deploys Rumors on Endor, drops<br/>
the Visage with Baron and a scrub piloting.<br/>
<br/>
I get some guys at my docking bays to drain, and wait for<br/>
Captain Han Solo, to go with one of my two Falcons in hand.<br/>
<br/>
I curse myself for not teching against the Bunker, cosz<br/>
E-Man prevents me from deploying there and beating the @#$%<br/>
out of him.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, i get a full Superfalcon up and running, with <br/>
Bacta Tank and OTE out. I cannot find my Punch It (as in<br/>
every other light game i am about to play today), but since<br/>
Kashyykk is the only system he has presence on, except<br/>
Endor, i am not worried about the Rumors-drain, i can <br/>
always retreat to Corulag to put Menace Fades into effect,<br/>
should his stuff prove to be more than i can handle.<br/>
<br/>
He battles me at the aforementioned system, with the<br/>
Accuser, some scrubs on board and the AO, but despite his<br/>
immunity, i draw high enough to make him forfeit everything.<br/>
<br/>
But next turn he laterals my Falcon, brings another SD with<br/>
crew (but still without Thrawn), Bossk in Bus and Dengar <br/>
against my power-zero Falcon. <br/>
I manage to kill Dengar and Bossk with my destinies, but in<br/>
return have to forfeit Leia, who wanders in the Tank.<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to get another beating and staying at his mery,<br/>
i elect to retreat to the rendevous point, to cancel the<br/>
lateral damage - but alas, he plays Gravity Shadow, and now<br/>
my ship is stuck.<br/>
<br/>
He again battles me, after adding the Chimera to his mix,<br/>
but draws relatively low, so i can just lose Chewie.<br/>
His ships plus crew, however remain unscathed.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, i manage to get to the Lateral Damage, and try<br/>
to cancel it - 1. Then next two turns prove to be equally<br/>
satisfying in that matter, as i draw a 2 and another 1.<br/>
But now, the drains are hurting more and more, and i have<br/>
to think of retrieval now, despite his SSPFT out.<br/>
<br/>
I edge Ben for five (to draw my tracked six), but mistrack,<br/>
draw a 2 (kal fal) and murder Mr.Ben (actually quite <br/>
humorous, as i would proceed to edge and kill Ben on another three times).<br/>
<br/>
We drain some more, but now, i have lost all my retrieval.<br/>
I finally get Melas to the Endor Docking bay, only to have<br/>
his drain blocked by Arica, who on the following turn <br/>
breaks cover to battle her adversary. After the dust has<br/>
settled, both the dancer and the alien are dead meat.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, with nothing else to show for (Home One and<br/>
Spiral went to my lost pile soon)- i succumb to his drains.<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss (15).<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Dark Deal vs. EBO<br/>
<br/>
Though he complains about having to lose to me in a drain<br/>
race, i am equally worried, because EBO is one of the <br/>
strongest Light Decks, and sets up much faster - still, <br/>
i start Resistance as my third effect.<br/>
<br/>
He sets up usually, while i try to make something out of<br/>
my crappy hand - i cannot find Search and Destroy, and he<br/>
finally commits some Baragwins to his Hoth Locations, which<br/>
lets me smile inwardly - Baragwin EBO is a deck i can beat.<br/>
(I very much feared EBOX, because its cannons would keep<br/>
me of my sector and prevent the deal).<br/>
<br/>
Well, he finally deploys two X-wings to his systems, so i<br/>
now know what i am up against.<br/>
<br/>
Our drains are equal for some time, because Resistance is<br/>
cutting in his potential to inflict harm on me.<br/>
But then he gets TK to block Mara´s saber-enhanced drain<br/>
at the Carbonite Chamber, while Boushh comes undercover to<br/>
the Executor Dockingbay to pay Thrawn a visit.<br/>
Seeing that i have no answer for the latter (Barrier), he<br/>
breaks Leia´s cover and kills Thrawn.<br/>
<br/>
Cannot find Vader, nor can i find the Sniper to kill TK<br/>
and reestablish my drain - his drains are now 4-1 in his<br/>
favor. To make matters worse, Jedi Luke, armed with his<br/>
fathers Lightsaber, comes down on Ardan and Janus at the<br/>
West Gallery,but is not allowed to pass due to a Barrier,<br/>
which gives my men a chance to run away.<br/>
<br/>
I finally manage to find my Sniper, and Mara kills Han with<br/>
my tracked six plus a four (about the only time, my tracking skills worked as the should) -  he now has three<br/>
x-wings at three different systems. I think of beating him<br/>
down, but i only have Zuckuss and Executor in Hand, and <br/>
HIS hand is always average eight cards, so without a ghhhk,<br/>
i have nothing to answer a swarm of x-wings and the game<br/>
could be over, if he deploys a cannon, power-pivots my<br/>
Capital and shoots Zuckass. So i play defensively, even<br/>
forego the deployment of my sector, because i only have<br/>
one Tie in hand to go with the Zuckuss in ship - clearly<br/>
not enough.<br/>
<br/>
The meager damage i do is covered by the Baragwin retrieval, so i look pretty stupid. Even moreso, when<br/>
he edges Jedi Luke for six, giving me the loss by 34.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : Dark Deal vs. HB Strikeplan Mains <br/>
<br/>
This game nearly everything works out for me, as it should.<br/>
I get a godlike setup - the Executor with three Admirals<br/>
at the system, so i can drop the Occupation on turn five,<br/>
i have Janus, the Emperor, Ardan and Bane Malar at my<br/>
sites, plus Vader in hand. The two Obsidian Ties get to <br/>
the sector, so i am ready to deploy the deal.<br/>
<br/>
He tries to contest me at the system - but without the<br/>
Superfalcon, his ships are no match for three battle -<br/>
destinies and average twenty power. So i slowly wipe him<br/>
of the system, and drain him out. Win by 22.<br/>
<br/>
The curse is broken - finally, i have won with a dark deck!<br/>
<br/>
Game four : Hidden Mains vs. Oldskool Ties (PotF-Start)<br/>
<br/>
I know that this will be hard; normally, the advise is to<br/>
stay away from them, so the cannot retrieve even more.<br/>
<br/>
But i have no I hope she is allright, no BattlePlan or<br/>
Aim High, i know that my db-drains won´t cut it here; on <br/>
top of that, i am unsure, whether i am able to initiate<br/>
and maintain a retrieval loop with my edge-cards, something<br/>
that would have saved me from the start.<br/>
<br/>
The first time i try to retrieve, i kill Ben again.<br/>
<br/>
I get the Falcon up, battle his lone Bossk in Bus and kill<br/>
him for five overflow - get out Bacta Tank and Chewie on<br/>
the Falcon for extra forfeit.<br/>
<br/>
After that, we have some skirmishes, the Falcon stands its<br/>
ground, i manage to kil some ties. Eventually i wipe him<br/>
of Kashyykk and have an uncontested drain for some turns,<br/>
but then he comes at me with four Interceptors, a <br/>
dreadnought, Dengar in Boat, plays All Power, which i <br/>
couldn´t grab the first time arround, because i had no<br/>
grabber then - his power is about 34 to my nine, and i draw<br/>
low, so i have to lose Leia and Chewie while he is immune.<br/>
<br/>
He soon battles me another time, after i had run to Corulag, and the ensuing damage is so bad, that i have to<br/>
lose Han, the Falcon, plus 11 more.<br/>
<br/>
From that on, i never seem to fully recover; i get off<br/>
a suprise assault for eight, but he deploys some more ties,<br/>
and retrieves with short-range fighters for twelve.<br/>
<br/>
(Btw, he played eighteen Tie Interceptors !)<br/>
<br/>
I drain some more, but he nails me in the end and i lose<br/>
by 35, which is the largest i have lost a game to, ever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am now 1-3, and i hope for another win to go 2-4; i know<br/>
it is higly unlikely, i will make 3-3;which turns out to<br/>
be right.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Hidden Mains vs. Random-space ground with Troopers.<br/>
<br/>
This game is rather easy. I pretty soon set up at the<br/>
Tattoine and Cloud City DB, he deploys Mara (which i barrier), followed by some troopers, i deploy Chewie and<br/>
Leia to Ben, play Order to Engage. He battles, Mara<br/>
succumbs to Fallen Portal, and i clean everything but one<br/>
trooper, who scurries away.<br/>
<br/>
I chase his other troopers plus a ATST again, get some <br/>
more damage in, then he finally deploys to space -  <br/>
for some reason, i don´t want to finsish him so quickly,<br/>
so i wait before i deploy the Falcon, since i don´t have<br/>
Leia or some other scrub to go with.<br/>
<br/>
Again i try to on the Edge Obi, AGAIN, i kill Obi, who -<br/>
this turn gets tanked. I get him out, try again, only to<br/>
kill him twice in one game - to add insult to injury, i<br/>
mistrack for two off the edges.<br/>
<br/>
Bastian and some others, standing arround, make comments<br/>
about my inability to track (and i feel rather foolish).<br/>
<br/>
In the end i drain him out, after a brief skirmish with<br/>
Jedi Luke and some guys at the backdoor, which nets me<br/>
another drain for three for several turns, and i drain him<br/>
out. Full Win by 17.<br/>
<br/>
Game six : Dark Deal vs. RST - bunker blowup:<br/>
<br/>
I know whats coming my way, but i get a crappy opening hand, and i know, i can only win, if i play my own game.<br/>
<br/>
We take some times to setup, and after he moves into the<br/>
bunker and plants a charge, which he misses the first <br/>
draw on, i seriously consider, taking Vader and Sarkli to<br/>
interfere with his plans, but i seem to detect a smile on<br/>
my opponents face, telling me he can read my mind - great !<br/>
<br/>
I play my own game, set up with some characters, most<br/>
notably the Emperor (Palpy got to see lots of action for<br/>
his old wrinkled days), get the System out, with the<br/>
Chimera and lots of scrubs aboard and the occupation going.<br/>
(I did not deploy the executor, because it got grimtaashed<br/>
 used an then lost to a drain). <br/>
<br/>
I further deploy the sector with a lone Tie, Barrier and<br/>
Mastermove, Zuckuss in Ship, in Hand. I draw up Bossk in<br/>
Hounds Tooth, after i deploy the Deal on the Sector.<br/>
<br/>
He comes down with the Superfalcon. I barrier. He <br/>
follows up with Dash in Outrider and decides not to battle.<br/>
I deploy Boskk in Bus, Guri as passenger and Zuckuss,<br/>
battle, he has to lose the Outrider, Dash, and the Falcon,<br/>
plus Han, but i lose Guri.<br/>
<br/>
He deploys Red Leader in Red 1 (no barrier this time),<br/>
initiates, shoots Zuckuss and draws high, while i draw low,<br/>
and lose Bossk. The X-Wing stays, to give me a nice drain<br/>
of two for the rest of the game.<br/>
<br/>
I get some more scrubs on Bespin, maintain the drains plus<br/>
an occupation for three, he tries to challenge me again<br/>
at the system, but i beat him off - still, his drains are<br/>
too much. Loss by 19.<br/>
<br/>
Woah, going 2-4, as predicted.<br/>
<br/>
Still, i didn´t make any gamebreaking mistakes, which is<br/>
good. I didn´t even forget to force-drain, but once.<br/>
(Did i tell you, i didn´t play in a sanctioned tournament<br/>
 for about one and a half years ?)<br/>
<br/>
As expected, Bastian and Martin get to play each other in<br/>
the Final Confrontation - with Martin winning with his <br/>
Light by 19, but losing with his dark by 26.<br/>
<br/>
So, in the end, Bastian gets to be the champ.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you liked the report. <br/>
