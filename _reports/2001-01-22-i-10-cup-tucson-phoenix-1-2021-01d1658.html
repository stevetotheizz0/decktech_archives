<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Pre-Tourny Stuff:<br/>
Well before the I-10 Cup actually started there was a YJ tourny.  I had watched people play YJ, and figured it couldn’t be that hard, but I can’t afford to get into another game.  So I asked Enrique for some decks and he let me borrow one and he asked one of the Jenn’s to le tm borrow one, so I got to play.  Now please understand I had played like 5 games of YJ total. I won that tournament.  Now this isn’t that great accomplishment, or so I have been told, but it was still cool to me.  But, I get luck by chunks so I that was my luck for the weekend, and that means if I win more than 2 games in the 8 possible for the weekend I will be happy.  Unfortuantely I wasn’t far from the truth.  I was playing a Court-Skum Mains deck which I really like.  And on Day 1 I played a Hidden Mains deck for Light and an EBO-scouts day 2.  (The fact that I changed my decks like that should tell you something).  My rating at the end of last year (since Big D hasn’t updated this year yet.) was 1530.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1  My LS (Hidden) vs Mike Girard’s Omminous Rumors (1847)<br/>
<br/>
Well, he starts IAO, Mob Pts, and YCHF.  I start DoDN/WA, Stagind Areas, Insurection.  I got a crappy opening hand.  With 22 characters in the deck I start with 1 in my hand and I had activated 0.  Great.  Well it was Corran Horn and<br/>
I plop him down at the Home 1: Docking bay. and leave teh 3 force.  Oh on his turn he did all the standard stuff, get Rendilli, and draw.  The game progresses with me setting up drains at the Tatooine DB, and him at Endor Forest (I think) I am hitting him for 1 and him for three.  Here is where my mental powers fail me.  I FORGET that he had put Ominous Rumors out so I put a lonely Wedge in RS1 out at Kashyyyk.  His next turn he drops Avenger, Dominator, Admiral Chinerau, and then Lateral Damages Wedge.  Well, needless to say I lost ALOT of cards in that.  And that was pretty much game.  He then started setting up Ominous Rumors and occupied 3 Endor sites so I was getting hit pretty hard.  I got off a OMDH towards the end game and retreived 9 but I lost it all to drains the next turn.<br/>
FL 20, 0 (-20)<br/>
<br/>
Good:  Corran Horn in openning hand to drop at Home 1 DB is a tank.<br/>
Bad:  Corran Horn being the only character in the opening hand.<br/>
Ugly:  How do you forget that Ominous Rumors is on the table?  I need to up my bribes to Enrique (TD) so I never get this pairing again!<br/>
<br/>
Game 2  My DS vs Jared Arthur’s Hidden Smugglers (1752)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I am playing Court and court does two basic things.  Forces someone to lose force if they have no presence on Tatooine, and your Bounty Hunters are forfit plus 2.  I forget both of these things all game long.  I start TinT/OE, No Bargain, Power of the Hutt.  He starts DoDN/WA, Squad Assin, and something else.  (Nothing that I can remember)  I start with Tat: JP in hand plus another one.  So I get all my sites out turn 1.  That was nice.  I got Boelo to AC turn 1 and said go.  He gets Mirax in her ship out by second turn.  I activate a ton of force the second turn and have Guri, and Zuchass in MH in Hand.  I activate use Power to look for Stinger (Well I was actually looking for one of the things I can pull, but most are in my hand, Bib, Ephant, and Boelo is on the Table)  Stinger is in there.  I also drew up Skum the previous turn.  What can I say it was a good first few turns.  I drop down Stinger for 1.  Guri for free, Zuckass for 5 and battle and retreive 2.  I get 2 destiny he gets 1 that is 0.  I destroy Mirax but her forfit covers it.  (Her and ship)  He battles 2 turns later with Wedge, and Hobbie in their ships and a gun.  He shoots Zuckass and the battle ends.  He didn’t like that very much but hey, that is what happens.  We go back and forth and I never hit him for court damage.  He eventually dropped a few people to the Sarlacc Pit and I capture them, but don’t move them cause I don’t want to flip.  In the ned I made BONEHEAD move number two of the game.  He had just completed an OMDH for like 8 or something.  Instead of activating I just hit him with drains.  I then can’t iniate the battle that would finish him off at the Sarlac Pit (I had Arica and he had some schmoe, I think Orrimarico &lt;sp&gt;.  So he iniates get a force back no one dies, completes another OMDH and I have to wait.  I activate, drain, battle kill Orri.  and then I drain him out.  in a few turns.<br/>
FW 17, 2 (-3)<br/>
<br/>
Good:  Well, most everything that wasn’t bad or Ugly was good this game.<br/>
Bad:  Forgetting to activate force to possibly end the game.<br/>
Ugly:  Twice I tried to Set for Stun Hobbie, and both times I failed by drawing Mara’s Stick.  ARGH!<br/>
<br/>
Game 3  My DS vs Steve Marshal’s Watch Your Step (1528)<br/>
<br/>
Well, Steve is a really good player and he has owned me in the past.  (Full losses by like 20+) He started Squad Assin, and 2 other cards, Insurrection and Draw their Fire maybe.  He gets the quick Falcon out to Tatooine I get Boeleo and Skum in my opening hand.  I draw some eating the drains at Tatooine, and get Guri and Stinger.  How cool is this.  He gets the AO out so that is a bummer, but I get over it.  I put out Zuckass from reserve and Stinger and Guri from hand to battle Han and a RFC.  He loses the RFC and I lose nothing.  He drops the Outrider and another RFC and I barrier.  In my turn I battle.  It upsets him to only get 1 BD, but that is why Zuckass and Guri is broken.  (OK, not broken but how much better can you get for 6 force?)  He way overpowers me and I lost Guri and Zuckass, and moved the Stinger to Kessel.  At this point I have nothing in the Lost Pile.  He deploys another RFC and moves everyone to Kessel.  We run around back and forth between Kessel and Tatooine for most the rest of the game.  He puts down 2 RFC’s at the Tat: DB and I go.  I deploy Iggy with gun and miss a RFC!  If you guessed I drew Mara’s stick you are correct.  DAMN!  Anyway, I am way out draining him and the retreival was too much.  I didn’t think I had the game until he ran out of people to deploy from hand.  Then I was OK. Bossk with a Ghhhk makes a late appearance and I retreive all but a like 10 before the game ends.<br/>
FW 22, 4 (+19)<br/>
<br/>
Good:  Well, when I needed a card it was there.  No major force loss.<br/>
Bad:  Well, nothing much.  It was an awesome game for me.<br/>
Ugly:  I think that Iggy not being able to capture a stinking RFC, is VERY UGLY!<br/>
<br/>
Game 4  MY LS vs Jared Arthur’s Abyssin Skum<br/>
<br/>
I have in my entire SW CCG career never beaten a skum deck.  NEVER!  I hate that objective.  I could recall how all the cards I needed never hit my hand or the table, but the game was basically settled in one battle.  I have Wedge in Red 6 and down comes Zuckass, and Bossk in their respective ships.  Oh and that card I have come to hate:  Lateral Damage.  I lose like 15 cards from that battle.  That was game.  I landed Jedi Luke at the Tatooine DB but he always was blocking my drains.  I never got going, and he was up and running like turn 3.<br/>
FL 28, 4(-9)<br/>
<br/>
Good:  Uh, the complete oppisite of my last game.  Nothing was good.<br/>
Bad:  Uhm, yep it was really BAD.<br/>
Ugly:  I HATE LATERAL DAMAGE!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Well, day one ended with a Tucsonian in first Patrick Gimber who went undefeated.  Mike Girard finished close behind in 4th (I don’t remember 2nd or 3rd).  I finished in 11th out of 19 on day 1.<br/>
<br/>
DAY 2<br/>
<br/>
OK I Am looking forward to a good day 2.  My DS deck did really well, and I am switching back to my LS EBO deck because it has served me well in the past.  So now to the pairings.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  My LS (EBO) vs Mike Girard’s Ominous Rumors<br/>
<br/>
WTF??!?!?!  How the heck did this happen again?  I have been given bad draws in the past (first game at the Mega Tournament weekend in Phoenix was aginast Brian Hunter) but I have been able to surprize some people if I can just get ANSB early.  I start with EBO but no Signal, and no ANSB.  This game was the same but I didn’t make the mistake<br/>
of deploying early.  An early Xixor hit the table and I eventually killed him.  My Golan LAser took out Janus and<br/>
that was the end of him on Hoth.  I finally went to space and tried to kill lots with 3 2 Xwings and LAndo in the Falcon.  He got no Destiny ( I converted Kashyyyk) but I just didn’t have enough force, and he beat them all down the next turn.  Just for good measure I On the Edged for 1 my last turn.  I drew up.<br/>
FL 26, 0 (-26), 2-Day total 4(-35).<br/>
<br/>
Well, iniatially we thought two people lost by 26 and there was a bye to give out.  The flipped a coin and I called it, but then it was three and they randomized it and low-and-behold.  Justin gets the bye.  DAMN!  And it was my DS too!<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 = BYE<br/>
2(-26), 2-Day total 6(-35)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My DS vs ?????? Watch Your Step<br/>
<br/>
Well, in playtesting my DS I lost big to a WYS so I want to rhetorically ’take no prisoners’ in this game.  In my opening hand I have Bubo, Xixor, and some interupts and effects.  My first turn I check for Skum (Using Power of the Hut) and they are both in there.  I am bummed. But I deploy Boelo anyway, and say go.  Next turn he drops Melas and a RFC to the Cantina and says go.  I drop Xixor and Bubo and try to munch someone.  Bubo tries to pick on Melas and gets a swift kick in the head.  I then battle anyway, just sacrificing Xixor.  He doesn’t draw any destiny, voluntarily.  I being a mean old fool, and really wanting to win this game to help my total, don’t tell him he can<br/>
draw destiny.  I clear the site with a 5.  And the rest of the game goes down hill for him.  I end up capturing 4 characters with Snoova (Two stayed captured, 2 went back to the Used Pile) and have no cards in my lost pile in the end.<br/>
FW 33, 4 (+7), 2-Day total 8(-2)<br/>
<br/>
Good:  Snoova was a machine.<br/>
Bad:  Bubo getting kicked in the head, then Xixor could have really beaten on someone.<br/>
Ugly:  Winning like this never feels right.  I hate playing against someone when nothing goes right for them.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My LS vs Patrick Hug’s Abyssin SKUM! (1784)<br/>
<br/>
DAMN!  Can I play against a deck other than Skum and Girard!  Man this is pissing me off!  The only good thing I was able to do this game was get ANSB by the second turn.  But then I couldn’t find the sites for EBO.  I had EBO in my hand and the people to set it up, but no, my deck didn’t want to cooperate.  He retreived lots and I didn’t.  Never found any of my retreival and only ever found a few ships.  It was bad.  Luke at the 4th marker finished the game off.  4 Abyssins payed him a visit and that was virtually game.  It ended a few turns later.<br/>
FL ~26, 4 (-19), 2-Day final total 8(-21)<br/>
<br/>
Good:  Getting ANSB reasonably fast.<br/>
Bad:  Not being able to set up EBO as fast.<br/>
Ugly:  I mean cammon.  Don’t you think Luke with Skick could kick 4 Abyssins arse at the 4th marker, espially if he had his BOOM-BOOM stick with him.  I don’t care that Myo is drinking a soda at the Audinece chamber.  How does that help those Abyssins on HOTH!?!!?!!?!!?<br/>
<br/>
Well I finished in 7th for day 2 (out of 13).  Mike Girard finished first on the day and ended up playing Patrick Gimber in the Final confrontation for the title.  Mike won both games by 27 and 5.  Mike won a trophy, and a small glass plaque.  I hope the next I-10 cup is just as interesting and competitive.  And I hope by then I will have the <br/>
<br/>
solution to SKUM!<br/>
