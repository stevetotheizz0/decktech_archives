<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Another thing..its realy late and im tired..so if i screw up sorry. I dont wanna goto sleep tho...go figure heh<br/>
<br/>
first off-nobody in hawaii is known. We have a few scrubs, but the tourneys are really only between about 6 people (prob how it is on the mainland too) I am one of them. Now you all probably think we suck, and since the higest rated player is only like 17 sumthin we do suck by ratings.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-tourney Stuff<br/>
<br/>
Well its saturday night (right b4 tounrney), and I sit down to think what im gona play. Tommrow is a special invitational tourney...basically the hawaii normals only. cuz joey is graduatin and goin off to college. So hes havin a tourney to kick off his party. (most people dont come till its over). Anyway like 5 min. after i start to think my friends call me and we go see mummy returns. Pretty confusin, but cool. I figure once you figure all the plot n stuff out it would be alot more clear. Anyway, i still reccomend it. Then we head over to califonia pizza kitchen to meet my parents for dinner. We finish at like 9 and my big mouthed retard dad says "we can take you home" i was like..no their gettin picked up..my dad was like its okay...so im thinkin FUK its alredy like 9 and i wont get home till about 10:30. I still didnt have my decks set (well my AOBS dark was pretty much set) and I still wasnt sure how i was getting there (the tourneys are like a hour away, so my parents only drive 1 way..im forced to car pool). Anyway i get home at 10:40 sumthin and immediatly call up tory (he’s like one of the best players-always makes creative decks w/ crazy a$$ tech) for a ride. He says hes pickin us up from chucks house. (yah thats the idiot guy...i think he jus posted a boy crazy deck..go figure..check it out if u want..heh) Well anyway my mom is like a @#$% when it comes to drivin. She wont drive me 15 min. to chucks house to get picked up. I end up bargainin w/ chuck that he gotta pick me up in the mornin. And i’ll take him home. So its set. Now i gotta take a shower n make my freckin light deck. I decide to play WYS w/ podracin n tat. anti duelin crap. My mom yells for me to get to bed if im goin. I sed i need to make my deck. Shes like u got 20 min. if ur not sleepin, u aint goin..im like crap. So i hafta use my rtp w/podracin instead cuz its like made alredy..jus gotta fit in the new tat stuff...i do..and i get to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
The next mornin i wake up super early..i just cant sleep. so I go do some techin on my decks. see how the new podracin works and all. I am satisfied with it. I make some instant saimin for breakfast..man that stuff is the $het$! anyway, he finally comes. We goto his house and wait for tory. He comes..we are talkin bout what we gonna see...they r like theres gonna be lotsa big drain dark decks (TDGWATT w/tat helper n ISB) so im scared to hell cuz i jus took out my menace fades and space jank to make room for tat stuff...i figured there would be no need...so i get my ship i need and cant seem to get a home 1 or a menace fades. Tory had a anthology box of commons/ cheapy rares in his car..so i look thru that. I look through the whole friggin thing and no menace fades. They dont got a home 1 either.<br/>
<br/>
We finally get to the tourney place. Its at some rec center in the middle of nowhere heh. by the time we arrive most of the other regulars are there. Joey n William Dinigea brother..joey is the best guy there cept maybe 4 tory. William is good...sometimes-depends what decks he uses. And the normal scrub squad (we dont have to say their names) and us 3. So already 10 people are there. and its still like 30 min b4, and we always start late. I beg madly for home 1 and menace fades and it seems as if i am screwed. after a while william finally decides that only one he has is for trade only if i give up my mauls...im like ok, gimme sumthin else. He asks what i need. "LSJK" he says ok..gimme that ai watto u got. I was like SURE!!! so my 2 mauls n a AI watto for LSJK n home 1. SWEET I switch out a rebel scout luke..and still seem to be screwd, cuz w out a mencae fades home 1 does no good. So some newbie comes, and i ask him 4 it. he bust out this hughe binder..hes like i got everythin in here. WOW!! he had every single common in there jus about..and alphabetically too. So now im set. I go over to a corner and fix up my decks.<br/>
<br/>
My decks: LS: RTP jank..basically mains n toys..w/ the hope that jar jar can make his runs n ppl go oop once i flip ( i gotta post this deck...its pretty sweet)<br/>
<br/>
DS: teched out AOBS..basically standard aobs w/ choke interupts<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
My AOBS vs. Jesse’s profit<br/>
<br/>
He is a newbie. This is like his first tourney, but tory lets scrubs/newbs use his spare decks (he has like 5 for each side) Anyway...he has no clue what he is doin. Basically..he takes forever on his turns. he drains 1 I lose 1. Reads all his cards thinkin he forgot somethin. I hit him for 8 maybe draw sum..this continues. Finally the TD is like 3 min left. If i get one more turn i win. So im like hurry hurry hurry. He says wait im thinkin, but then joey (person that taught him sw) says..jesse u cant do anything..jus let him go already. my turn..Game.<br/>
FW by 20<br/>

<br/>
Props-this deck for winning first game ever.<br/>
this deck for working how its supposed to.<br/>
Joey for giving me a full win (blessing in discuise)<br/>
<br/>
Slops-playing such a newbie<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
My RTP vs. Joey Dinigeas (sp.? i think its right) tat. Mains<br/>
<br/>
I started RTP w/ podracin u started like mauls site n jabbas palace. for the first few turns it was just draw up or save. we forgot to podrace like 3 turns. Anyway then he dropped maul and mara w/ saber to desert landin site. I dropped 8D8 then relased leia same turn. He dropped at the prison w/ choke vader n sum shmuck then battle. He choked my 8D8. Then his power was like 10 to 3. I had to sac Leia and like 5 more. That sucked but o well I had leia in hand jus in case that happened. I put her down to Y4 dbay and then flipped. He spread to like 3 site w/ at least a main and another guy at each. I was draining 3 a turn at the tat dbay. It looked 1 sided for a really long time. I sorta gave up. I then put quigon w/ saber down and drained 2 at y4 dbay. Finally I won the podrace. i couldnt retrive cuz he tossed down plans. He lost 6 because I won. It turned out pretty close loss by 6 or sumtin like that. I was pretty pissed off after that<br/>
<br/>
FL by 6 2(+14)<br/>
<br/>
Props-him for making a interesting deck, and makin me think i was screwed. Also him for teachin me to never give up!<br/>
Me Winning the podrace against his sebulbas pod. at least I did 1 good thing this game.<br/>
<br/>
Slops-Me, I coulda maybe won if i tried.<br/>
<br/>
We take a break. Since it is joey’s tourney he annonunces the prizes. There is a stack of like 30-40 mains/good stuff and a big mara jade autograph. 1st place get the mara. Hes tryin to get it back, but already im screwed..too bad, cuz that mara shoulda been mine....A while back we were playing the last game. We were both 3-0 whoever won took 1st. I was playin ebo vs his DS fround beats deck. I ICBW one of his drains. Since it was a 1 turn kill deck, he its worsed me for like 25 or something crazy...i Lost...and cuz of its worse that mara is his.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
<br/>
My Aobs vs Joey Dinigiea’s Hidden mains variant(crap..I had to play him agen.Now im wishin he didnt say any thing the 1st game..I wouldn’t have had to play him 2 times) <br/>
<br/>
I activate and bust out corusant dbay. Deploy a vigo ther, move xizor over and draw up. His turn. He pulls out dagobah and yodas hut n home 1 day..Im thinkin hidden mains. (basically is..but he says is too different to be hidden mains...o well) 2nd turn I drop D* dbay and transit xizor n the vigo there I flip. I make him lose for a few turns...and he dont like it anymore. He pulls out a tat dbay, and drop LSJK and Qui gon there. Quigon has a saber. That makes me flip bak, and i dont like it! So i go down to fight w/ Epp fett, ECC bossk, 4 lom w/ gun Powers about even and I got some tricks so i fight. 1st off I use bosk to try and captur sum 1. I draw a 2 and capture Qui-gon. He points out that I dont have a bounty, so I cant do the subtracty thing. Im like CRAP cuz i got a bounty sittin rite there in my hand!!!!!! i was pissed. Anyway I killed lukes game text (mistake) then I got luke hit w/ hidden weapons. 4 lom go chopped And i had to sac every 1 xcept fett...he transited to xizor...anywway I made 2 big mistakes in that battle, and it cost me the game. 1. If I targeted quigon w/ 4 lom, we woulda had a clear site. But no! And If i tossed a bounty, I woulda made him lose some force. Anyway at least the luke is gone. Next turn he play OONE ta to pull LSJK back...im like crap. By now theres like every single frecken dockin bay around...I try to figt, but every tim i out power him he transits away. Never ending chase. I lose by like 17 or somethin<br/>
<br/>
Full loss by 17 <br/>
2(-3)<br/>
<br/>
props-him for doin that cool oone ta tech to screw me<br/>
to all the scrubs that are currently ahead of me (like 2 or 3 outa 12) heh<br/>
<br/>
Slops- Me for makin 2 big mistakes!!<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My RTP vs Davin’s pile deck (the cool guy that gave me menacefades)<br/>
<br/>
Well this is one of the newbies that is ahead of me. He actually isnt that bad, jus needs to work on his decks a litte. Well anyway this is a pretty one sided game. I win the podrace and everything goes my way this game. towards the end, JarJar came out for his suicde runs. W/ brisky mornin, its like automatic oop!!! well...I retrived like my whole deck w/ death star plans and all so i won by like 37<br/>
<br/>
Full win by 37<br/>
4(+34)<br/>
<br/>
After goin 2-2 what crap! i end up with 5th. I got 5 of those special cards things. I got a Sith probe, chimerea foil, hounds tooth, a white borederd unique SD and a mandalorian armor. I gave back Davin his menace fades tiped him a dollar (rental fee and gave him the hounds tooh (he wanted it)<br/>
There was also the pizza hut starwars banner at the place (old EP1 promo) and last place got it. The guy was nice enough to give me the banner because he didnt want it. (I did help him w/ his decks and give him some commons b4 the tourney tho. So anyway I give him the other 2 junk cards. I go home w/ a new LSJK and that pizza hut banner thingy its cool<br/>
<br/>
Props-Joey n family for having a great tourney and all. They even gave us lunch and snacks! Thanks<br/>
Davin- the super cool guy that gave me the menace fades (i ended up not need ing it tho-THX anyway)<br/>
