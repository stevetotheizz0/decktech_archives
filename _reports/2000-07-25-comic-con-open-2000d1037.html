<br/>
  Well after being out of town for a couple of weeks, I am one beat man.  I nearly slept all<br/>
day on Monday.  The first weekend Chris Hines and I went to Origins and had a blast,(I<br/>
never had time to write a report from that.)  Then this past weekend a lot of us went to<br/>
San Diego Comic-Con from Vegas.  We had three car groups driving up.  So a total of<br/>
nine people went up from Vegas.  I had the hook up for a place to stay.  Matt Lafontaine&amp;#8217;s<br/>
Mom calls me up and says she has a Nephew in San Diego who owns this Apartment<br/>
Complex and that I can stay in a one Bedroom Apartment for free.  So I canceled my<br/>
room reservations and jump on that opportunity.  Now when we got there, this was just a<br/>
one bedroom apartment so it was a tight squeeze with 5 people staying with me.  Never<br/>
the less it was free so it was worth it. <br/>
<br/>
  I was practicing with proxy decks a lot before this Tournament, because I expected to<br/>
get my DSII cards on time before the event. I thought I had some cool ideas, but it meant<br/>
little really.  As it turned out I didn&amp;#8217;t get my cards in time.  So I ended up playing with my<br/>
old decks with what little cards I was able to borrow from others.  We had some good<br/>
players at the event with, Paul Feldman, Clayton Atkins, Greg Miller, Kevin Shannon, Joe<br/>
Floyd, Jim Lafferty, Steve Greenburg, and many others.  Here are the decks I went with:<br/>
<br/>
DS: My Huntdown with more Systems to get around Honor of the Jedi, and one more<br/>
Alter, and some surprise assaults instead of Torture, and Imperial Barriers were added as<br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
LS: My Profit with DSII cards added to make it rock.  Like adding the new starting card<br/>
and insurrection and activate more at Docking bays.  It generates a lot of force it was fun.<br/>
<br/>
  With not that many DSII cards and not really that much time to playtest I didn&amp;#8217;t really<br/>
expect to do very well.  Plus I really didn&amp;#8217;t think my Huntdown could hold up, but it did<br/>
fine, and I really didn&amp;#8217;t have time to build anything else anyway.  I was determined to have<br/>
a good time and talking with all the players and putting a face to the names I see here was<br/>
cool.  I didn&amp;#8217;t take any notes so all my games are from memory.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My DS vs Paul Todd Feldman&amp;#8217;s EBO<br/>
<br/>
When I saw this I was so happy.  My Huntdown takes down EBO 8 out of 10 times. <br/>
However this time did not prove to be good for me.  I used to play with 3 evaders in my<br/>
deck, but I took it down to 2 and he was able to get an early choke going with an<br/>
revolution on my Med Chamber.  I did find my systems eventually, but it was little to late. <br/>
I  deploy to hoth with ships to slow down some drains, but he was backing up with ships<br/>
also.  Soon I ran out of ships and he did get a good beatdown on me.  Honor of a Jedi<br/>
prove to hurt me this game.  I wasn&amp;#8217;t losing from my Visage, but if I starting draining on<br/>
the Executor I would be the only one losing from visage.  I did have a drain their for 4 but<br/>
when he got Rebel Fleet out it meant little.  I had some bad luck during this game as well. <br/>
Ever SAC draw I did I drew a 6 or 7, but ever battle I did I drew a 1 or 2.  The only good<br/>
thing is that he was having some bad draws as well.  I end up losing by 16. <br/>
FL by 16<br/>
0(-16)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Playing Paul Feldman, we never did get matched up before so this was the first<br/>
time.  <br/>
Lows: Bad destiny draws...yuck<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My LS vs Tony Ameng&amp;#8217;s SFS with Flagship Ops<br/>
<br/>
  I friend of mine just built one of these decks and it could be brutal and have retrieval<br/>
pretty good.  I was a little worried at first, but I figured I could do ok with a few good<br/>
choices.  He set up FSO really quick and was draining a system sooner than I expected.  I<br/>
spread thin at my sites and freed han to retrieve my 10 force that I lost through his drains. <br/>
I did a well time Grimtaash to get rid of 3 ties and 2 All power to weapons out of his<br/>
hand.  I altered his Dreaded Imperial Starfleet so he could stop my drains, and then profit<br/>
damage did him in.  Not to mention I hit him again with another grimtaash so he didn&amp;#8217;t<br/>
retrieve to much.  Full win by 24.<br/>
2(+8)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Grimtaash saves the day.(twice)<br/>
Lows: Not much really<br/>
<br/>
So now I am thinking if I win every game by 25 or more I might be in the final.  Of course<br/>
that is a tall order, but there is nothing wrong with hoping and planning :)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS vs Matt Lafontaine&amp;#8217;s  There is Good In Him<br/>
<br/>
Matt is a up and coming player from Las Vegas.  We did some playtesting so we know<br/>
each others decks pretty well.  He is starting to make some really good decision to win<br/>
games.  First turn I get Vader out to capture Luke which almost was a bad decision on my<br/>
part.  He comes down and beats up on Vader so I lose Vader.  He then plays Out of<br/>
Commission and the only two cards in my Lost pile are Twilek and Vader so I am like<br/>
CRAP.  Lucky for me he grabs the Twilek and I am saved.  I think I would have lost this<br/>
game if he chose Vader.  We had some good battle in space, he did get some ships to fight<br/>
against me, but he couldn&amp;#8217;t stand up to my fleet.  Vader with 4-Lom and Mara was taking<br/>
care of the ground and I squeezed out the win by 15.  Full Win by 15<br/>
4(+23)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Occupying three battle grounds to still make him lose to visage.<br/>
Lows: Playing someone from Vegas,  seems to happen all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LS vs Wayne Waitman&amp;#8217;s Endor Ops<br/>
<br/>
Endor OPS oh my god I didn&amp;#8217;t think I would do well against this.  I was hoping for a<br/>
good starting draw and at the same time hoping he didn&amp;#8217;t get ephant mon on his starting<br/>
draw.  Well as it turn out I did get Boushh in my starting draw so I deploy her to the<br/>
Bunker first turn.  That proved good later in the game.  He got burned a couple of times<br/>
with Narrow Escape and OTE out.  I had to do some Jedi Mind tricks to keep him<br/>
deploying to his systems just to get him to deploy more stuff from his hand.  He was<br/>
draining like made in space with the character that adds to drains and Ominous rumors, it<br/>
was bad.  I had to lose like 8 a turn.  But I kept asking question like &amp;#8220;how much power<br/>
you have there?&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;do you have ability there?&amp;#8221;  So he kept deploying some back up<br/>
which I was happy about.  I did my damage and it was enough for the win.  Full win by 10<br/>
6(+33)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Well I was winning, but these new DSII cards are keeping my dif low.<br/>
Lows: Not being able to take out his force at the Endor Docking bay.<br/>
<br/>
Well I didn&amp;#8217;t have a chance anymore for the final, my dif was to low, but I was still going<br/>
to try and have a good finish.  My other Vegas players were doing pretty good as well. <br/>
Chris Hines was pretty close to me so I was thinking we might play each other, but as it<br/>
turn out we didn&amp;#8217;t and we played with the same side so we didn&amp;#8217;t have a chance to which<br/>
was cool.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My DS vs Chris Baker Baster(sp?) HB deck with weapons.<br/>
<br/>
He had a cool looking deck. But everything was going my way in this game.  My first turn<br/>
I activate and draw a couple and save some.  His first turn he loses the effect &amp;#8216;your insight<br/>
serves you well&amp;#8217; and grabs Honor of a Jedi(like everyone else was doing).  He deploys a<br/>
ship to the Point and says its my turn.  I deploy Vader to the Med Chamber with Presence<br/>
all ready there, and flip my objective and then Alter Honor of a Jedi.  YES good draw and<br/>
he didn&amp;#8217;t have it immune to Alter yet.  Well since he didn&amp;#8217;t have any Visage protection<br/>
except for that, that hurt him for awhile.  I was winning all battle in space and my senses<br/>
was hurting all his cool interrupts.  I was subtracting 2 from his battle destiny&amp;#8217;s because<br/>
Vader was at the Med Chamber and he seemed to be always drawing 2&amp;#8217;s.  He did manage<br/>
to cancel Visage with a spy and then on the next turn he drain and I hit him with a<br/>
Surprise Assault and a track destiny 7 and 5, so that was game for me.  Full Win by 24.<br/>
8(+57)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Altering Honor of a Jedi, second game I played and still got around that awesome<br/>
card.<br/>
Lows: Everything really went my way I really can&amp;#8217;t think of anything.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My LS vs Steve Greenburg&amp;#8217;s Bring Him before Me<br/>
<br/>
Oh great I have to play a World Finalist, and on top of that he is playing the one Objective<br/>
I didn&amp;#8217;t want to play against.  On his first turn I figured out it wasn&amp;#8217;t going to be that bad,<br/>
because he was playing it fake style which was cool, but not enough to win.  What he did<br/>
was get the Emperor to his throne room and the effect where he can draw battle destiny<br/>
and was playing SFS in space.  He never had a Vader in his deck.  It was a good deck and<br/>
I loved the Idea.  Apparently many others included James Lafferty were playing this deck,<br/>
and it did quite well.  I was able to Grimtaash him for some important cards and even<br/>
cancel SFS with Alter.  But he just got in back.  There is little to say in the game because<br/>
the only thing he was doing is draining me in space and I was draining him on the ground. <br/>
I had some bad draws here and there, but I was still making him lose more force than he<br/>
was making me lose.  Toward the end of the game I drain him for 8 with one character<br/>
everywhere, and made him lose another 8 to profit damage.  I did that twice to finish him<br/>
out.  Full Win by 11.<br/>
10(+68)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning against a cool strat, I thought, and going 5-1<br/>
Lows: Having 20 cards in my hand and only 2 were characters early in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Well Chris Hines ended up losing to Peter Nordstrom so he only went 4-2, and all other<br/>
Vegas players did about the same record.  The Final was going to be Kevin Shannon vs<br/>
Jim Laffety, Clayton was undefeated until his last game which just barely put him to third<br/>
place.  My differential was only good enough for 5th, but I guess I was happy for that. <br/>
Here is the Top 10<br/>
<br/>
1. Kevin Shannon, 12(+104) <br/>
2. James Lafferty , 10(+111) <br/>
3. Clayton Atkin, 10(+104) <br/>
4. Peter Nordstrom, 10(+84) <br/>
