<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">ok i was in a hurry the last time i wrote this report, <br/>
but there are some things that i must add.<br/>
firstly during the drive to phoenix from tucson, <br/>
i decided that i hate WYS, and i dont want to play it.<br/>
its a winning deck. it is a good deck. BUT it is just too<br/>
much cheese for me to play it, and be proud of myself.<br/>
So i opt for my There Is Good I Obi deck. <br/>
justin beal says that his LS deck sux, and he wants to use mine. <br/>
i think this is ok since i wont be using it.<br/>
so anyways AFTER the tournament i find out that beal<br/>
went undefeated in his LS portion of the tournament. <br/>
his only loss was to hayes with his DS AoBS deck.<br/>
this makes me feel like crap because i got second to last in the tournament. <br/>
of course both time i played hayes i should have beaten him.<br/>
this bring me to another part that i left out. <br/>
when i was playing my MotR deck(maul on the rocks) <br/>
i had seven force, and time was called to end the game on <br/>
my turn.<br/>
i was not going to draw, so that he couldnt just do some damage to me, <br/>
and then i would loose totally. <br/>
hayes would then only win on time. i thought this was good.<br/>
hayes was surprised when i didnt draw out, and he said "you know<br/>
im going to loose a lot of points if you dont draw out"<br/>
being hayes’ friend i said "oh yeah, how many?"<br/>
"32" and after this i considered how close he was to brian hunter,<br/>
and i considered my own ranking. he was very close to being<br/>
number one in the world, and i didnt want to rob him of it.<br/>
if we wernt in tournament play he would eventually have won<br/>
the game, but it was called on time. i decided i wouldnt be<br/>
a @#$% to a good friend, so i drew up. of course i had about 3 <br/>
people say some @#$% like "that is BS because he should loose points"<br/>
which just means everyone else was just jealous cuz i didnt<br/>
bend over and rape a good friend of mine. overall, i think<br/>
i took the right choice. plus i think hayes’ might have liked<br/>
the rapage because he grabed my leg in the car ride on the way home.<br/>
(dont deny it hayes, you flamer)<br/>
overall i had a fun time, and the best part about the experiance <br/>
was the trip, and not the star wars.<br/>
for prize support i won a enchanced CC pack with the IG88 in it.<br/>
highs: <br/>
playing my obi deck, and beating the hell outta hayes and <br/>
some guy who was playing on hoth.<br/>
<br/>
lows: <br/>
having been cheated and lost the last game which i shouldnt have.<br/>
learning that i got second to last. <br/>
**ALMOST** beating hayes twice, but failing both times to pull it off. </font></td>
