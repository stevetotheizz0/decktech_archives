<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This weekend brought a no-classes Friday to the University, and with this, Santa Cruz became a bit deserted of the student populace.  A sleepless night 2 days ago got me into the Star Wars mood when I constructed what I believe to be an innovative and excellent deck that I hope to use next week at the Los Gatos/San Jose Super Saturday - November 18th.  Feeling bored and alone, I escaped the dropping temperatures in favor of hitting my friend Steve Daniel’s tournament in San Jose.  With 2 other tournaments happening in the central area of the region, I feared that it may not be sanctioned.  Upon arriving with my annoying little brother in tow, I find 5 other players.  One person is on the road and minutes away, so we decide to wait.  While waiting, a blast from the past appears: Brian Cooper.  He bestows Steve with 2 official Decipher T-shirts: General Veers and Jabba The Hutt.  After talking with him for awhile, we decided to get started with the 7 we have.  Dan Mochizuki draws the temporary bye, and learns how to play WWF Raw Deal with Steve.<br/>
<br/>
My decks:<br/>
LS - Why Ewoks Care About Hansicles v2.0 - after playing my Agents/Ewoks deck last week, and comparing to my prior Profit/Ewoks deck, I decided to return to Profit.  This is a conversion of my Ewok Agents and Jedi Protectors into Profit.<br/>
DS - ISB Biker Gang - ISB using Outer Rim Scouts piloting Speeder Bikes on Tatooine with Scum &amp; Villainy<br/>
My DS deck is up here on DeckTech; my LS will be up maybe next week.<br/>
<br/>
My rating going into this tournament was 1809, and I was ranked #51 in the Alderaan Region.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - LS v. Timothy Green’s This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time (1343)<br/>
He starts 5 effects, and Mighty Jabba + KITIK KEED’KAK at the Audience Chamber.  I say, "Okay" and get a fast start.  His 2nd turn, SE Boba Fett and Chall Bekan came down to my Endor Landing Platform against Graak and a Spearman; he battles, I Fallen Portal Chall, he loses Fett.  My drains start eating into him, while he takes Order To Engage damage at the AC (I had Bo Shuda + Tessek there).  He got Dark Deal set up really late, with lone guys setting it up, and didn’t leave Force to move them around.  EPP Obi and DOS came to them and wrecked them.<br/>
<br/>
Result: FW by 35; 2(+35)<br/>
Good Things: Fast start; feeling good about my switching back to Profit.  Free retrieval of 10 is always nice.<br/>
Bummers: Beating a scrub.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: He played well for someone his age (like 10 or something); didn’t make any unforced (no pun intended) errors.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - DS v. Alex Stefanko’s Hidden Base fake-out (1744)<br/>
I knew it was coming, but hoped it to be later rather than sooner.  Oh well; @#$% me now.  His first turn, out comes Dagobah and Yoda’s Hut.  Then, the EPP @#$%storm.  I got so damn Force- and site-screwed that it wasn’t funny.  I was able to get Scum &amp; Villainy out, but he kept Nabruning his mains everywhere.  I kept pressing him about the time, which made him lose his focus.  I came back a little lategame, but didn’t have any hope at all.<br/>
<br/>
Result: FL by 24; 2(+11)<br/>
Good Things: none<br/>
Bummers: Read above<br/>
Compliment of opponent: None.  I hate my little brother, his medium rating, and his shameless use of copied decks.  Irritating<br/>
<br/>
We democratically vote against a dinner break in favor of finishing the small tournament before 11 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - DS v. Kevin Shannon’s Agents In The Court Chandra-Fans (2023)<br/>
I looked forward to playing against one of Kevin’s Phoenix GS decks.  Once again, I got Force- and site-screwed.  I flipped, and got in some decent drains.  He got a lone Bothan Spy down to the Imperial Square, but my lack of cards in hand prevented me from doing some serious damage.  After taking a drain of 4, I tried some pure tech out.  I deployed an ORS there, battled to retrieve 2, then tried to Nevar Yalnal the Spy away.  I drew a 0.  Guess what happened to the lone ORS next?<br/>
<br/>
Result: FL by 11; 2(0)<br/>
Good Things: none<br/>
Bummers: That’s 2 games in a row in which I’ve made a dumb mistake in.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: As always, a great game until I made that foolish move that cost me the game.  I wish I wasn’t such an idiot and scrub in our games, though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - LS v. Ray Liu’s Fondor-Combat Response start (1450)<br/>
After going 1-2, I was glad to be paired against a scrub.  I helped him improve this deck a few weeks ago at KK’s, which was his 1st tournament, so I knew what to expect, but since my deck has no ships in it, I couldn’t capitalize on lone starships draining me.  I drew Jedi Luke and Anakin’s Saber in my opening hand, which made me laugh.  1st turn he went to the Endor DB.  He was later joined by an Ithorian, Kazak, and a Spearman.  With Tessek at the AC, I got a drain of 5 going all game at the DB.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t draw a site to save my life.  When EPP Vader came down to Tatooine: Jabba’s Palace vs. DOS and an Ithorian, I drew one for battle destiny.  Arggh.  Next, Threepio and another Ithorian join DOS and battle Vader.  I draw ANOTHER site for destiny.  He draws high, so the site is cleared of my guys.  Two turns later, EPP Obi comes down and beats Vader off and surviving thanks to him drawing a site for battle destiny.  Han joins him immediately.  Finally, I get 2 more sites out, and after that, my drains and Profit damage do him in after I retrieve with Nar Shaddaa Wind Chimes.<br/>
<br/>
Result: FW by 29; 4(+29)<br/>
Good Things: Feeling better after scrubbing out with my Dark deck.<br/>
Bummers: none<br/>
Compliment of opponent: He played quite well and is very lucky that I don’t run starships.  I think that’ll be my first tweak of this deck, though  He did win his 1st game in a tournament, which is congratulatory.<br/>
<br/>
Out of 8 players, I ended up placing 3rd and pulled That Thing’s Operational and I’ll Take The Leader in my prize packs.  Dan Mochizuki took first and the Jabba The Hutt T-shirt after beating my brother twice.  Kevin Shannon ran in 2nd, and my brother got 4th.<br/>
<br/>
What did I learn: Getting Force- and site-screwed SUCKS.  My ISB deck is now going to be shelved, in hopes that a return may be inevitable.  Ewoks with massive retrieval backing them up are a force to be reckoned with, and can create some great havoc.  Lando With Vibro-Ax rules.  Playing Out Of Commission 1st turn on Prepared Defenses is funny.  Raw Deal is a decent game; if I had the cash and the motivation, I’d get into the game.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading my report.  The next Los Gatos/San Jose Super Saturday (2 tournaments, one morning, one evening) is November 18; if you’re in the area, stop by!  All details are posted on the Decipher website.<br/>
