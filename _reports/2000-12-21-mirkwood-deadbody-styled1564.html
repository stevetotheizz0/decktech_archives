<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay here is the standard Mirkwood TR from the Tuesday night tourney<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my BHBM with tramples vs. Ben Johnson<br/>
<br/>
Okay first off Ben is our resident Newbie, he comes almost every week and has a great attitude, but I don’t think he has ever won a single game.  So I knew that this would be an easy game.  Opening hand Rendilli, Ozzel, Veers, marquand, Blizz. 1, and a trample.  GOODIE.  I search and pull Exec. with Mob. Pts. ,and pull Emporers power.  Activate, Deploy Rendilli, Emp. Power, Ozzel to DS2 DB, Palpy to Throne room, and save 1.  Ben is playing RST, he deploys Crix, and a scout to RLS and draws.  I activate, deploy another DB, save.  He activates deploys a couple more guys, and draws.  I activate, deploy walker with 2 pilots to RLS. Battle, Trample Midge, play Imp. Command and use Emp. Power, leave only Crix.  His turn, instead of moving away, he deployed more guys (luke Chewie, mon mothma) and battles.  I make him lose more guys.  After another turn of this he puts down the great forest and moves his megar remaining forces there. Mistake, his guys who aren’t scouts can’t move away.  By this time I added another Walker with Watts piloting, and moved both walkers to follow him.  He deploys a few guy to the RLS, and tries to move all his guys to there, I point out that he can’t move Luke or Chewie out of the Forest (chewie w/gun not a scout) so I let him deploy all his guys to the forest, but he doesn’t battle.  I deploy Lord Vader w/saber to the forest, capture luke and battle, wipe out all his remaining characters, and move one walker w/ vader to the Landing platform, transit Vader to DS2 and the rest of the game is me draining him out, and trying to turn luke (never lost a duel).  Full win +21<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My oola the horrible used pile goddess vs. Herb<br/>
<br/>
Okay this game was not much fun, Herb is a very cutthroat player, and no one around here really enjoys playing him, since he thinks that he should be able to take anything back, but won’t let anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
So onto the game, Herb was trying to build the Death Star and I had an oola throne room DB deck.  on his first drain both of my ships hit the lost pile, and this game turned into a non-interactive drain race, with me at every site on the ground and him at systems.  He won by 6, thnaks to vader landing late in the game, and blocking a coup[le key drains, and the DS2 moving over to Mon Cal, and making me lose an extra 2 per turn.  Fl by 6 and a not fun game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 my LS oola is a pile of crap deck vs.  My own personal Whipping Boy (aka Josh Grace:)<br/>
Josh was playing a SYC for Big Blue with manipulation, and it was just over themed, I never oola’d him cause on his 2nd turn Vader Tarkin hit the table and never left.  I again took over ground, and got home 1 into space, so battle plan didn’t hurt me, and it was a drain race, where I had the advantage, since I controlled all the sites on the ground and he only had 2 systems, and vader getting chased by Ben, this was over early.  Fw +15-20 (I forgot how much)<br/>
<br/>
After that game he played my Jawa Death Horde with that same deck and won by like 5.  So I’m glad I didn’t play Death Horde for the Tourney.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs. Josh Grace again.<br/>
<br/>
uh-oh, I really only can beat Josh when he is playing fun decks, and his Profit isn’t fun.  I deployed Mara to the AC (dumb, I should know better, what was I thinking?)  and moved her to JP.  he activates draws, leaves a couple, depoloys another site, and says go.  I activae get the rest of my stuff set up, drain for 3 and say go.  he activaes, deploys Ben, Massa Luke, Wedge.  Battle, Weapon Lev. swing hit, Battle destiny 6, I lose like 12 force besides Mara.  That was the game, my BHBM deck is very solid, if I don’t play stupid, but it never wins by much more than 15-20, and josh put me into a deep hole.  I tried to spread out and drain race him, but when he freed Han it was all over.  FL by about 20.<br/>
<br/>
So I went 2-2 but played Josh twice which was fun although losing to my whippin boy wasn’t cool (next week I’ll bring Cheese to vanquish him hahahaha)<br/>
