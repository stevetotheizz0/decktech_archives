<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Usually, the Mirkwood tournaments draw 10 or a dozen<br/>
players, but there are the occassional (and random) nights<br/>
when a good-sized crowd will gather at Mirkwood for Star<br/>
Wars CCG mirth and merriment. Tuesday’s tournament was one<br/>
such tournament, gathering around 20 players, including<br/>
Royce, a suprise guest from the Alderaan region who, much<br/>
to my chagrin (and Scrye’s), opted not to play Rescue the<br/>
Princess...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, to continue the protracted preamble to this report,<br/>
I went up to the register to fork over my dollar for the<br/>
tournament (since I forgot to take one of my Cloud City<br/>
packs from my apartment) and overheard Tim, the store’s<br/>
co-manager, and Garrett, a player, talking about something<br/>
when Garrett said, "We should really let Josh decide."<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, I asked, "Let Josh decide what?"<br/>
<br/>
Tim said that, due to my performance in Mirkwood tourneys<br/>
over the past month, I had earned a foil Japanese Vader.<br/>
The option (!) in this decision was that I could put it on<br/>
the line, allowing the eventual tournament winner to claim<br/>
the Vader. I actually thought about this for a few seconds;<br/>
that’s my proof that I’m a sporting fellow. Then, like any<br/>
sane individual, I took the Vader. And promptly traded him<br/>
with Chad &amp; Jerry for a Jedi Luke (yes, Chad &amp; Jerry will<br/>
get "props" this week instead of the usual trader "slops").<br/>
<br/>
It turned out Tim had another foil Japanese Vader to throw<br/>
on the line for the tournament winner, anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
So, feeling like less of a heel, I entered the tournament<br/>
hoping to win a 2nd Vader. My chances were pretty good, I<br/>
thought, since Mike Ravelling had decided to play Dion<br/>
Erbes’ decks and let Dion play his.<br/>
<br/>
My Light Side was a Throne Room Mains deck with Ishi-Tech.<br/>
Dark Side was an ISB powerhouse w/DB’s.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My Light Side vs. Rich Jeffries’ SYCFA Manipulator<br/>
<br/>
To make a short story shorter, we both dumped a bunch of<br/>
sites out onto the table in the first couple of turns while<br/>
I controlled the DS:DB early with Obi-wan. He put Vader<br/>
down to battle Obi (and an Ishi-tib, I think), but a Fallen<br/>
Portal was the end of Vader. Lucky draw, but that’s how it<br/>
goes for me against Rich. No big surprise. So, then he<br/>
put Mi’yoom at the Executor DB (?), planning to start his<br/>
manipulation, and drew up... all of his cards! (??)<br/>
<br/>
So, Lando w/Axe, Luke w/Saber and some others came down to<br/>
kill Mi’yoom with Draw Their Fire hitting the table, and<br/>
shortly after Rich lost that battle, I ended the game with<br/>
no lost pile.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+29)<br/>
<br/>
This has apparently put me in the top pairing which, with<br/>
a foil Japanese Vader on the line, was pretty darn cool.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS against Nick’s (not-quite-Ravelling-style) WYS<br/>
<br/>
Having lost to Mike Ravelling’s broken WYS deck on Saturday,<br/>
I decided to play cautiously, setting my forces up to avoid<br/>
a multiple-destiny beat-down. This allowed Nick to get in<br/>
a couple of early drains against me, but soon I had an<br/>
undercover spy blocking his Cantina drain, Walkers and/or<br/>
the Emperor (and the ominous Force Lightning) blocking all<br/>
the battleground DB’s, and big blue in space at both<br/>
Tatooine and Kessel (with enough destiny draws to crack<br/>
his Falcon’s immunity). There wasn’t any battling since he<br/>
played a barrier when I set Grand Admiral Thrawn and the<br/>
Chimaera up against a lone Captain Han, and, from that point<br/>
on, Nick was afraid to challenge my forces, and it just<br/>
didn’t pay for me to attack him, since all his drains were<br/>
cancelled each turn (or I would lose an ISB agent and<br/>
retrieve him with the objective each of my turns).<br/>
<br/>
However, Nick made me pay for my impatience when I grabbed<br/>
his Rebel Barrier. He must have played On the Edge 10 times<br/>
and retrieved 4 force with it each time. Yet, the ISB lock-<br/>
down proved too effective for him to overcome, and it was<br/>
merely a matter of time before my drains overtook his<br/>
retrieval.<br/>
<br/>
FW 4(+42)<br/>
<br/>
After this game, I managed to trade with Royce for a Smoke<br/>
&amp; Mirrors 5. X-Files may not be a popular game anymore, but<br/>
it’s cheap, baby, and fun! I think I traded a Mon Cal<br/>
cruiser for the X-Files equivalent of a Mara Jade (and her<br/>
saber). Surprised to learn that Dion Erbes had an extensive<br/>
X-Files collection, I taught him the rules for the advanced<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
So, going into game 3, I was again in the top pairing, this<br/>
time against my own personal Lex Luther (or am I his?),<br/>
Mike Ravelling. But Mike was playing Dion’s decks, so I<br/>
didn’t expect as tough a game as usual.<br/>
<br/>
(Meanwhile, Mike’s decks were 1-1.)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS vs. Mike Ravelling playing Dion’s CCT Hansicle<br/>
<br/>
I didn’t draw any 2/0 locations in my opening hand. Just the<br/>
Home 1 DB. So I threw that down and searched for the Echo<br/>
DB. Oola went out to the Home 1 DB for early generation<br/>
and, hopefully, to get out an early lock. But Mike played<br/>
his 1st turn intelligently (duh) drawing a handsize just<br/>
above my activation and saved the rest of his force. On my<br/>
2nd turn, then, I deployed Leia w/Blaster to the Carbon<br/>
Chamber and moved her over to rescue Han. With no Rebel<br/>
Barrier in hand, I saved a force hoping to bluff Mike. But<br/>
it was to no avail. Mike, in fact, had drawn a Mara and<br/>
deployed her against Oola, fetched her saber and put First<br/>
Strike on the table. Oola died, but Mara drew Mara for<br/>
destiny, so the loss was recoverable. I hoped to take<br/>
advantage of First Strike by throwing out Chewie Protector,<br/>
KFC, some other scrub and Luke w/Saber against Mara. But<br/>
Mike had the barrier for Luke. I don’t think I battled that<br/>
turn.<br/>
<br/>
The next couple of turns saw me losing battles at the Home 1<br/>
DB while Mike was retrieving from First Strike. I eventually<br/>
decided that it wasn’t worth the fight and had Luke transit<br/>
the heck away. So it became a drain race for a while, and I<br/>
was losing. But Mike attacked Leia and Cap’n Han with Ephont<br/>
Mon and Mighty Jabba. When the smoke cleared, Ephont Mon<br/>
had died along with Cap’n Han, but Mighty Jabba couldn’t <br/>
afford to run his lard @$$ away from Leia before we all<br/>
discovered that Han hadn’t died but had just run away to <br/>
fetch his blaster. So I initiated battle, hit Jabba with<br/>
Han, targetted again with Leia to add 5 from Aim High, and<br/>
drew a total destiny of 9. Mike ended up losing Jabba and<br/>
11 force while Han took Advantage of the situation to run<br/>
over to join Obi-wan and Major Hashish at the CC DB. I ate<br/>
another drain of 2 at the Home 1 DB before I was able to<br/>
deploy Boussh to block that site. Mike was now losing the<br/>
drain race and attempted to retrieve force by battling<br/>
Luke w/Saber and an Ishi-tib with Bane Malar. However, that<br/>
move backfired when Luke sliced Bane and drew a 4 for<br/>
destiny to Mike’s... 0 (I didn’t even have to lose the<br/>
Ishi-tib). That pretty much summed it up. One or two more<br/>
turns of draining ended the game.<br/>
<br/>
FW 6(+51)<br/>
<br/>
And it’s looking good so far since there are only 3<br/>
undefeated players left, and one of them, Tim, has a timed<br/>
win. I’m 19 differential ahead of 2nd place and think I<br/>
might get two Japanese foil Vaders in one night.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My ISB vs Mike Ravelling playing Dion’s Hidden Base<br/>
<br/>
Well, this wasn’t what I wanted. After the last game, I had<br/>
breathed a sigh of relief and shook Mike’s sweaty hand...<br/>
Only, as it turns out, to play Mike again. Royce, the other<br/>
undefeated player with full wins, is on the same side as<br/>
me, working his Alderaan tech with Scum. (Tim, meanwhile,<br/>
is playing Light Side and *should* be playing me, but<br/>
Decipher’s software doesn’t see things that way. And none of<br/>
us realize this until after the game.)<br/>
<br/>
So Mike and I sit across from each other once again. I<br/>
decide to start You Cannot Hide Forever in order to ditch<br/>
it later for Search &amp; Destroy. Mike starts Squassin, Wise<br/>
Advice/Do or Do Not, and the effect that lets you forfeit<br/>
weapons. So I think it’s a B-wing deck or such and joke<br/>
that I’m not going to be stupid enough to deploy to space.<br/>
<br/>
I get an Emperor in my hand and deploy him for free to<br/>
the Coruscant site, use IAO to get the Coruscant DB and<br/>
move Palpy over. Along with Rendili, this gives me<br/>
beaucoup activation early. Mike reveals Tycho to fetch<br/>
Green Squadron 3 and set him up at Rendili. Well, I swallow<br/>
my earlier comment about not deploying to space since my<br/>
hand holds: the Executor, Chimaera, Grand Admiral Thrawn<br/>
and that crazy Victory Class whose name I shall never<br/>
remember. So I save force for a turn and deploy Thrawn in<br/>
the Chimaera to his Barrier. Blah.<br/>
<br/>
We then battle frequently in space, and I lose. I can’t<br/>
get agents on the ground to flip. I can’t set up Imperial<br/>
Decree or Search &amp; Destroy. I can’t kill Corran Horn. And,<br/>
when on my 2nd turn I search for a docking bay, the only<br/>
one in my deck is the &lt;&gt; DB that I want to deploy to Kessel,<br/>
Kiffex or Coruscant. Except I forget that people who are<br/>
playing pure space play the Coruscant system, so I deploy<br/>
my generic docking bay to some drain-1 system instead. While<br/>
I go about losing all my ships in battle (including Bossk<br/>
which I draw later), I probe all of Mike’s systems except<br/>
the correct one.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I’m upset that I’m going to lose the foil Vader,<br/>
but given my poor play, whittling Mike’s force down to a<br/>
differential of 13 was an accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
So, I go 6(+38). Royce loses his game by 4 or so. But Tim<br/>
notches a 4th win to take the tournament and a foil<br/>
Japanese Vader.<br/>
<br/>
Mike Ravelling gets 2nd. I get 3rd. Nick, who travelled<br/>
down from St. Cloud for the tournament, defeats Royce,<br/>
knocking him out of the top 4, to claim 4th for himself.<br/>
<br/>
Chad, Jerry, Justin Alfs and I discuss the possibility of<br/>
taking what I know of the incredible, edible Middle Earth:<br/>
the Drinking Game and modifying the rules for Star Wars CCG.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers:<br/>
Tim for the big win!<br/>
Mirkwood for all the tournaments and the great support.<br/>
Chad &amp; Jerry. To get them off my back.<br/>
Graham for the surprise Cherry Coke.<br/>
Mike Ravelling for being one of the few players to<br/>
consistently play well enough to merit shaking a<br/>
consistently sweaty palm.<br/>
Jedi Luke being for destiny 6 (even if I never drew him).<br/>
Foil Japanese Vader for being trade-bait for a Jedi Luke.<br/>
Rich Jeffries, thanks for the auto-wins ;-P<br/>
Royce, Nick, Nick’s brother, Sam, and Sam’s friend (even<br/>
though he cheated) for joining in the fun.<br/>
Royce for the Smoke &amp; Mirrors 5.<br/>
<br/>
Jeers:<br/>
Herb. Had to constantly avoid him.<br/>
Decipher’s software. I get screwed weekly.<br/>
Ex-girlfriends in general.<br/>
