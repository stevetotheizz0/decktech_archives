<br/>
Prologue- I had a tough time trying to work out a few minor <br/>
details of the Dagobah Regionals. I was losing interest in <br/>
the game and was trying to save money for other stuff. My<br/>
friends Dan and Lee were very interested in going though so <br/>
I figured I'd at least think about it. I was strapped for<br/>
cash and decided that if I was gonna go I'd try to make them<br/>
pay for most of the journey. I ordered Death Star 2 boxes <br/>
but they came 6 days after I expected them so I was a bit <br/>
crippled for playtesting. I decide that I know I won't <br/>
have the deck(s) fully tuned so I'm just gonna flat out<br/>
play the opponent to get the win. I was thinking Lightside <br/>
Weapons and Musicians. I decided to mess around with the new<br/>
DS2 Objectives and gave them a fair shot. ::Speed up to Day<br/>
before Regional::. We arrive in Jacksonville in very good <br/>
time. The downside is that the hotel jerks me around<br/>
saying : a.) they didn't have any reservations in my name <br/>
b.) you need to be 21 to get a room and c.) I could try my<br/>
luck down the street. So I could either go find another<br/>
place or wait until any of my friends over 21 would arrive<br/>
and help me rent a room. So we finally find a place to give<br/>
us a deal and we finally start playtesting and using the <br/>
group think. We are all playing the same Dark Side and Lee<br/>
breaks form from our Light Side. <br/>
<br/>
Decks : <br/>
<br/>
LS- " For 3 years the system kept me down as forfeit fodder<br/>
but now I'm the supafly!" - Uses New Wedge to the fullest<br/>
Matching pilots and Weapons. <br/>
<br/>
DS- " Burn Him Before Me" - Decided to tap around with this<br/>
new objective to see how it does. Battle heavy and flexible<br/>
always sounds good to me. <br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : " Burn Him Before Me" vs. Gabe Alonso's Profit<br/>
<br/>
I start Arrest Order , Mobil Points , and Crush. I also get<br/>
Mara Jade and Evazan to start at his Audience Chamber. He<br/>
starts Goo Nee Tay which I figure is kinda risky since I<br/>
could get Emperor and Alter it right off the bat or even<br/>
try with Mara. Ah well I get rolling and deploy Emperor to<br/>
DS2 Docking Bay and kick out Rendili too. He drops Master<br/>
Luke right off the bat versus Mara and Evazan , battles ,<br/>
and draws a 5 ( Narrow Escape ) to my 1 so I lose them <br/>
both. I deploy Commander Igar and Tempest 1 to JP and he <br/>
later flips and retrieves. Ben Kenobi comes down and its <br/>
gonna be hard to get rid of General Solo. He kicks out <br/>
Bargaining Table and starts cancelling drains with aliens.<br/>
Before I know it I'm down like 25 cards and he's got like<br/>
2 cards in his lost pile and is pretty much set. I decide<br/>
to start doing some Chamber invasions. Vader comes in and<br/>
gets Barriered. I decide to give him Janus Greetus to keep<br/>
him company. He has EPP Leia , Ben , Han , and an Elom <br/>
to battle and give me trouble. Vader is at least keeping<br/>
Luke as captive and probably preventing like 3 more <br/>
destiny draws or combos. He battles at the AChamber and I <br/>
Weapon Levitation Ben's Stick. Leia misses and we draw <br/>
destiny him getting the better of the situation. He gets<br/>
two and I make him revive. Vader dies and I'm really <br/>
limited in my decisions because of force. I deploy another<br/>
Vader and use You Are Beaten to exclude Ben. I use the <br/>
Emperor's Power to get a decent draw and force him to lose<br/>
Leia at least but Vader goes down again. I decide to sent<br/>
Janus for a walk to help out Igar. Igar has been doing <br/>
the whole draining thing joined by a Projection and a PotF. <br/>
I'm taking more damage and I'm in danger mode. I gotta<br/>
step up here and make the game or break the game. I deploy<br/>
Lord Vader with his Lightsaber to the Audience Chamber and <br/>
battle versus General Solo , Ben , Elom , and a Monk. <br/>
I have to hit Ben and Lord Vader is insane adding to his <br/>
weapon destiny so I rack up like a 10 total and Ben is <br/>
slashed. The tricky part is that I also have to rack up<br/>
8 attrition to get rid of Solo and avoid any more damage.<br/>
I use Emporer's Power and come up with exactly 8 which is <br/>
awesome. He tries to revive Solo during weapon segment <br/>
but because the End of a battle is after all forfeiting<br/>
Ben has to survive to revive ( heh- it rhymes ) he's gotta<br/>
lose Solo. That's huge. So he tries to minimize the damage<br/>
and throws out Harc Seff and an Elom to battle and try to<br/>
suck up all the damage. I slash an Elom and he tries to <br/>
forfeit all his characters there but can't. I say can't <br/>
because he has this one little B'omarr Monk who has survived<br/>
for quite some time but doesn't participate in offensive <br/>
battles so he takes 3 damage , stacks a force , and now<br/>
has to choose between staying inside versus Vader with <br/>
Lightsaber or go outside to Tempest 1 , Igar , and Janus<br/>
with the possibility of 2 destiny plus I could burn the<br/>
Emperor's Power so he's looking at a lot of damage either <br/>
way. He decides to stay in the AChamber. On my turn I drop<br/>
Tarkin , 4-LOM , and beatdown on the Monk for 16 after the <br/>
Monk , he also has to stack a card and I've jumped right<br/>
back into the game. His turn he starts drawing while I start<br/>
draining and playing catch up. He puts down Mos Eisley and I<br/>
move my characters around to my best and leave super ginzu<br/>
inside. Eventually Ben Kenobi and Orrimarko are deployed at<br/>
Mos Eisley so the end game is near. We keep positioning <br/>
ourselves around and I put Vader's Shuttle up at Rendili<br/>
to fulfill the Battle Order I tracked so hard to deploy <br/>
-- gotta love the retrieval from Op Killer. I haven't seen<br/>
a ship all game until he deploys Lando in Millenium Falcon<br/>
in front of Vader's Shuttle. After deploying Lando he has<br/>
exactly one force left and draws it ( fearing Emperor's P <br/>
to draw a 5). It was probably the longest I've ever waited<br/>
for someone to decide to draw a card or not at a critical<br/>
time ;) I'm putting lots of pressure on him with my drains<br/>
and drop down First Strike , battle twice , retrieve 2 while<br/>
he loses 2 and I get rid of Lando in Falcon. Battle Order <br/>
is fulfilled and Igar packs up and moves away from Mos<br/>
Eisley. If Han isn't deployed all he can do is battle me,<br/>
if he deploys Han then I have an extra drain of 2 in the<br/>
Audience Chamber. He was in trouble either way. So I pull<br/>
up a win by 7 or 8. Record : 2 ( +8 ) <br/>
<br/>
Highs : Coming back after a huge deficit. Punishing him and<br/>
basically winning the game off one mistake. <br/>
Lows : Watching like half my deck go to my Lost Pile in<br/>
       Record time. <br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : " X-Y-Z Supafly" vs. Walter Cowart's ROps <br/>
<br/>
This game goes bad for a deck I've spent soo many cardslots<br/>
to mess over. Basically a 3rd turn Search and Destroy <br/>
eats me for like 20 force while I struggle to find my <br/>
last system I need to flip ( Systems get in active pile<br/>
quickly when you activate a ton ). Not much to this game.<br/>
Monnok helps keep the game from major surprises. Just about<br/>
everything just twisted a little bit to mess me over. I <br/>
think this game was over in like 15 minutes. <br/>
Record : 2 ( -13 ) <br/>
<br/>
Highs : limiting the loss to 21. <br/>
Lows : Just about everything. <br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : " Burn Him Before Me" vs. a scrub<br/>
<br/>
It was ugly. I deploy Vader and he deploys EPP Luke to an<br/>
X-Wing in space. He takes like 3 damage from Your Destiny<br/>
the whole game through. He uses lots and lots of X-Wings<br/>
but its just over after it starts. Win by 25-26. <br/>
Record : 4 ( +12 ) <br/>
<br/>
Highs : Deciding when to lose the Op Killer to retrieve<br/>
a card. <br/>
Lows : Not working hard versus player.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 : " X-Y-Z Supafly" vs. Lee's Bring Him Before Me<br/>
<br/>
Lee seems a little unhappy about the pairing and lets<br/>
the room know. We both know each other decks but I keep<br/>
switching my Hidden Base on him so that gives me a bit<br/>
of an edge. Vader hits Cloud City Docking Bay so I give<br/>
him Farmboy Luke. Mara and Saber deploy to take his place<br/>
while Supafly in ship and Jek on Spiral hang at Bespin<br/>
system. I cancel his drain with It's a Hit and start <br/>
doing a little bit of damage. He deploys like the Avenger<br/>
and Devastator with Evax aboard and Lateral Damages <br/>
Spiral. I have a Laser Cannon on Wedge's ship and when he<br/>
battles I play Power Pivot to make the Evax ship Power=0 <br/>
but he Senses and loses 3 force total for it. I take a bit<br/>
of damage and draw a 0 to make things worse. I stack a card.<br/>
I kick out another system or two and flip then move Wedge<br/>
and ship to Kessel while Keir Santage goes to Kiffex. <br/>
He drops Chimaera which I barrier and he puts Tarkin on it.<br/>
On my turn I Tunnel Vision for Falcon and drop Cpt. Han<br/>
and Falcon. I battle and come up big by drawing a 10 battle<br/>
destiny which gets rid of Tarkin , Chimaera , wins the <br/>
battle , and I play Legendary Starfighter on the Falcon<br/>
so he starts losing 2 force everymove phase which is big.<br/>
He finally probes the correct system but I It Could Be <br/>
Worse the damage so I'm up and put Landing Claw on the Falcon<br/>
to make it safe as possible. He cancels the Claw with Godherd<br/>
but its too late. Win by 21. Record : 6 (+33)<br/>
<br/>
Highs : Drawing a 10 destiny to knock out Chimeara for Legend<br/>
and getting a solid win.<br/>
Lows : He had 2 cards stacked and with a freaky win of a <br/>
battle he could've won the game at any time. <br/>
<br/>
Game 5 : " Burn Him Before Me " v. Walter Cowart's Throne Room<br/>
<br/>
So its Throne Room start versus Throne Room start. I start <br/>
Op Enforcement along with the normal two to keep SAC down.<br/>
Side note here : I was actually supposed to play Light Side <br/>
again but since I'd already played Walter with the Light Side<br/>
I figured that they know that I can't play him with the same <br/>
side again so I walk over and use my Dark Side. This causes <br/>
me to play my Darkside this game and the next which is probably<br/>
in my advantage to do. First turn I deploy Emperor to CC:DBay<br/>
and go. He deploys Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker from Reserve , <br/>
a Nudj , battles , and plays Smoke Screen to have a 12 power<br/>
while I only have like a 5. Its 7 or just Emperor.<br/>
I toss Emperor aside like its no big deal and it isn't. <br/>
So I get out Rendili and generate and stuff and draw trying to<br/>
figure a way around Jedi Luke. He deploys Lower Corridor and<br/>
moves Jedi Knight Luke into there and deploys another Nudj to<br/>
the swamp but forgets to move it ( huge ). I have Fett in Slave<br/>
1 up at Rendili and Battle Order on the table so he's paying for<br/>
his drains. The downside is he deploys Obi-Wan Kenobi with Saber<br/>
to the Corridor too so he is paying 3 to drain for 3. Once <br/>
again I'm looking at a +15 card lost pile very quickly and have<br/>
to pull another big comeback to win it. He forgets to move a <br/>
Nudj over to the Farm again so I decide to make him pay. I drop<br/>
Tempest 1 and Igar ( I only play one of each but T1 came out <br/>
every single game and the combo popped twice ) so I have <br/>
fulfilled Battle Order for the time being. He gets to Drain<br/>
me for 3 twice and moves over a Nudj and I choose not to pay<br/>
to drain for 1 until I get Battle Order up for free. I manage<br/>
to get Evazan and Blizzard 2 down to the Swamp and Janus moves<br/>
into the Throne Room (his). So now I'm paying nothing to drain<br/>
and I hit him for 6 drain while he pays 3 to drain for 3. On<br/>
his turn he deploys Supafly to his Homeone : War Room and <br/>
deploys Home One to Rendili for like 7 Force...Barrier. Heh.<br/>
On my turn I deploy Lateral Damage on Rendezvous Point , deploy<br/>
Mist Hunter , and Dengar in Ship. Battle I draw good and after<br/>
all it said and done he loses Home One , Wedge , 13 to battle<br/>
damage , and stacks a card. That was huge. He drops Melas and<br/>
Boussh to the Throne Room but its already too late. He does more<br/>
damage here and there but not enough. Win by 7. <br/>
Record : 8 (+40)<br/>
<br/>
Highs : Getting huge confidence boosts in this deck , twice<br/>
spotting players rated over 1900 and 2000 about 20 force and <br/>
coming back to win the game. Keeping from getting beat twice by<br/>
the same person. <br/>
<br/>
Lows : I seem to keep being the person on the edge playing <br/>
someone with one less win so I need higher differential to get <br/>
into to the Final.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 : " Burn Him Before Me" vs. Will Raiman's Good Deck<br/>
<br/>
I think his name was Will Raiman , nice guy , reminded me of a<br/>
mini-Steven Turner :) Well I let them know that I should be <br/>
playing light. One of the weirdest feelings is when you both<br/>
pull your Light decks to play. They say we should've looked<br/>
at the cards but yada , yada , yada things stay the same so<br/>
I get to play my Darkside 4 times and thats an edge for me.<br/>
So this can be an epic game that could be won at any time <br/>
because both DS2 Objectives are being played and every battle<br/>
counts. I get my usual generation and deploy Fett to Rendili<br/>
to fulfill an early Battle Order. He starts pulling Scouts <br/>
left and right with Madine and stuff. I bring down Lord Vader<br/>
with stick and start smacking around scouts. I You Are Beaten<br/>
any particularly nasty ones and we tie on power a ton of times<br/>
which is weird and keeps us from stacking cards. I'm burning<br/>
Emperor's Power a bit so that keeps me a little be behind. <br/>
I manage to spread out a bit and hit him once with Your <br/>
Destiny because Luke forget to move from the Hut for a turn.<br/>
He's got scout crazyness and we keep manuevering around each<br/>
other but I've got Battle Order so his major activation is<br/>
put to use for drains. He plays Insertion Planning a few times<br/>
which is pretty cool. I never really manage to beat him down<br/>
because he's got a ton of scouts and plays with the most<br/>
under-rated card from Endor , Corporal Delevar. So I'm just<br/>
tossing little guys aside and have Tarkin cancel a destiny here<br/>
and there. He's got out like 5 sites so I can keep Vader away<br/>
from Luke and Force loss. He never ever comes to space so Fett<br/>
just drains away for 1 a turn. We start transitting all over<br/>
the place and Luke finally catches up to Vader ( side note :<br/>
he used like Hidden Trail or Great forest thing where Scouts<br/>
can move from any location to or from there and could've<br/>
caught Vader like 3 turns quicker) little mistake. Vader , <br/>
Blizzard 2 , and Tarkin move to Cloud City while a whole ton <br/>
of scouts move to Death Star 2 for a mortgage and come to say<br/>
hello to the Emperor. Another side note : he could've kept<br/>
a destiny draw at the Docking Bay and made it so the Emperor<br/>
couldn't move away and we would've had some interesting<br/>
battles. I stacked maybe a card or 2 and the same was with him.<br/>
In the end though I've got him pretty solid. I win by 13-16 ?<br/>
Record : 10 ( +50-something )<br/>
<br/>
Highs : winning<br/>
Lows : Not winning by enough to reach the finals.<br/>
<br/>
Overall it was a great tournament that ran so smoothly it didn't<br/>
feel like I played 6 games. Tournament was over at like 5-6 ,<br/>
no bad rulings for me , and I came in 5th so I picked up the <br/>
last custom trophy made by Gregg Keefer. I turn in my usual<br/>
5-1 performance at a major event and land in Top 8 in Dagobah <br/>
for the 4th year in a row. <br/>
<br/>
I watch the Final confrontation which was pretty much a bore and<br/>
actually made me pretty frustrated. Ben Matthews' decks sucked<br/>
and Charlie Herren made a bunch of silly mistakes one was pretty<br/>
major. After a 29 win with his Light Side its pretty obvious that<br/>
Charlie will win especially after Ben has like 10 systems on the<br/>
table and a bunch of X-Wings. Nothing really special about the<br/>
games. <br/>
<br/>
Tournament Observations : Squadron Assignments was in probably<br/>
60-80% of all the decks I saw , that was a bit of a shock. <br/>
Ralltiir Ops probably consisted of 25-30 of the 64 players <br/>
Dark Sides decks. Lord Vader is insanely strong with a <br/>
lightsaber , even if your paying +10 for him. My darkside can <br/>
spot a lead and then make it really interesting at the end. <br/>
Pairings make all the difference if you lose. My rating will <br/>
go up like +50 points so I just cranked up my highest rating <br/>
ever a few notches and should be in the 1980s range. <br/>
<br/>
After Tournament : Lots of fun stuff. Most of my friends stayed<br/>
the night after the tournament so we went out to eat , played <br/>
cards , and played some N64. After spending one night in a<br/>
good hotel with a bad shower and one night in a bad hotel<br/>
with a good shower I truly believe a good shower can overcome<br/>
any bad hotel. <br/>
<br/>
Funniest happening of weekend : Before going to Bennigan's for<br/>
dinner we're all outside and Lee takes out a cigar and lights<br/>
it , those who don't know him look a little shocked , then Josh<br/>
Hoade says out loud " WHAT THE HELL, or **** , ARE YOU DOING?".<br/>
Lee gets scared and spazes out dropping his lighter and cigar ,<br/>
it was pretty funny. <br/>
<br/>
Props : <br/>
-to Neal Razi and Joshua Hoade for making me laugh<br/>
-to Lee's Suicide Knob which was really fun to spin when it<br/>
was boring driving. <br/>
-to the funny stories in Swank , which were better then the<br/>
pictures. <br/>
-to Jason Burrows , for being cool.<br/>
<br/>
Slops : <br/>
-to any gibronies who couldn't beat the players higher then<br/>
me ;)<br/>
-to Swank for showing like skanks.<br/>

"You mean you can use 2 force to get a card with Ralltiir Ops?" <br/>
( Neal in sarcasm )<br/>
<br/>
"How many times have you started just S-Foils in an X-Wing deck,<br/>
how many times have you played no SAC protection in an X-Wing<br/>
deck , how many times would you start the signal over 3 effects<br/>
over The Signal in an X-Wing deck ?"<br/>
