<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">today was...today was brutal!  i show up at this tourney...maybe someone else will show up that's decent.  NO.  i really shouldn't put it like that, but it's the truth.  8 players showed up, two of which were the younger brothers of the tournament director.  i almost felt bad.<br/>
<br/>
LS: turbo drain profit<br/>
DS: court bounty hunting<br/>
<br/>
game 1 LS vs. Ralltir<br/>
1st turn flip for me, draining for 8 by turn 3.  he comes with vader, but doesn't kill han.  still draining/occupying for 5 after he flips.  i send ECC chewie to fight Ozzel on a scout walker (to Sense his reacts and recycle 3 senses).<br/>
i drain him out on about turn 10.<br/>
2 (+25)<br/>
<br/>
game 2 DS vs. EBO clouds<br/>
i'm worried about this one, but when he starts messing with clouds/miners, i realize that i'm fine.  Search and Destroy + court damage hurts him alot, and Fett in S1 battles back and forth in the clouds with a couple gold squadron ywings.<br/>
scum+first strike retrieve alot for me, and i drain/court/S&amp;D for the win.<br/>
4 (+55)<br/>
<br/>
game 3 LS vs. TDIGWATT<br/>
again, i'm worried.  i've never seen this dude before, and he drops 4 locations on his first turn.  goo nee tay saves me, since he's not running characters that have immunity to it (through his objective).  he gets out occupation, but not before i'm draining him for 8/turn.  vader/tarkin come to the AChamber, but fail to kill han.  cat and mouse with Blizzard Walkers.  drain/occupy eventually kills him.<br/>
6 (+80)<br/>
<br/>
game 4 DS vs. Chandrila Ops<br/>
puzzled, i start off by dropping jabba to the AC, and he just sits there getting out sites.  WHAT DO YOU DO ON CHANDRILA???  so i get out reactor terminal, battle alot with Scum+first strike, and draw alot of cards.  WOOPS!! he ends up drawing up while i have only 24 force.<br/>
8 (+104)<br/>
<br/>
game 5 DS vs. EBO<br/>
i get a good draw, getting SPrecautions, JPalace (to look for Rancor Pit) and drop jabba and Exec Docking bay.  basically, he's getting hit by S&amp;D + court, and then bousch gets captured, luke gets captured, tawss gets eaten...etc, etc, etc.  unfortunately he draws up before i can trapdoor luke and retrieve another 7 (+12 for the bounty that Fett is toting around Epp Luke with).  he's drained me alot with EBO, but resistance works well for me.<br/>
10 (+126)<br/>
<br/>
game 6 LS vs. Huntdown Duelling<br/>
VERY bad draw, so i just drop EPP leia with Anakin's Stick to Med. Chamber (w/POTF) and move to cancel visage.  he sits at the AChamber with Bane/Mara for like 4 turns, doing nothing.  IG captures Leia.  vader comes down on Med.Chamber.  i deploy Ben + Master to smack some lame 3 ability imperial (BY HIMSELF) for about 6 cards.  vader elises (and i can't sense it), vader duels ben (can't sense it again), and vader LOSES the duel.  lucky for me.  so vader's dead.  mara obsessions luke, turning him.  i free han, retrieve 10, and beat another lone imperial schmo.  eventually draining with leia (freed via SATM) and Ben on the Executor for 4, and then ending the game through drains/beatdown at the AC against Needa/Veers for about 12 cards.<br/>
12 (+155)<br/>
<br/>
how do things like this happen?<br/>
i have no clue.<br/>
<br/>
so i win 3xCCpacks and a WB vader.<br/>
<br/>
i'm thinking that i won't come to another of these tuesday tournaments so the kids can have their fun.<br/>
<br/>
cool<br/>
