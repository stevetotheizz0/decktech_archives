<br/>
Fist Game:<br/>
<br/>
My Training Deck, vs. Girard’s Chevin MKOS deck<br/>
<br/>
This game is exactly the same as the Friday night tourney except this time Mike only beat me by 23 instead of 24.  Anyhow, First turn Mosep and Gailid come down first turngreat.  He picks up and leaves a force for Imperial Barrier, (btw I pack 2 Bith Shuffle/Desperate Reach which don’t do anything since I’m not Brett Kitani aka lord of the g-d draw).  I go, put down the jungle, training area, bog clearing, daughter, backpack, get test 1 and pick up.  That was basically the start of the game.  He drains me many times, I come down and battle once with lando with vibro ax, this was funny because he couldn’t cancel my 7 on test 5 with ephant mon.  I eventually get off test 6 and make him lose force once before I die.  It wasn’t a very entertaining game, besides us joking throughout the game, Girard actually is pretty entertaining.  We shake hands and part our ways.<br/>
<br/>
FL 0 (-23)<br/>
<br/>
Now I’m thinking I’m in the losers bracket I should be able to win my next game.  Next game:<br/>
<br/>
My TIE intercepter deck (set your course) vs Gavin Li’s Hidden Base<br/>
<br/>
GREAT MATCHUP!!!<br/>
I’m thinking he’s playing starfighers and whatnot.  He turns out to be playing everything, squadron assignments, rebel fleet with regular ships, capitals, Kessel Run, Our Most Desperate Hour, you name it.  I sat there for most of the game doing nothing waiting for stuff to battle.  First turn I get my death star war room, merryjk, I started Wakeelmui and Seinar in my hands, and I’m looking cool.  Gavin goes, first turn, savrip, I feel the conflict, rebel fleet, haven, pop out a system, (I’m looking a little more glum now, the dark cloud has fallen over me).  Basically nothing happened for many turns, I drew up a lot, and he stacked like 6 ships at the rendezvous system.  For the battles since there weren’t many drains at all.  I pop down U-3PO at his Home One docking bay then deploy EPP Vader with cards stacked,  I hit Jedi Luke, ping back some guy with set for stun, and draw a 5 and 6 for destiny and used prepared defenses, (owwww) I lose vader give him a card for I feel the conflict, he loses his 4 guys.  We had 1, just on big battle in space, I have 5 TIEs, 2 Dreadnaughts, and Fighter Cover on table, 2 Ties have guns.  I shoot 4 ships, ouch, that’s got to hurt, (Falcon, Tycho, Wedge, and a B-wing), not bad.  I do all power to weapons, (hehe, showed a few buddies what a couple power 10 TIEs looked like, heheexcellent).  I draw a destiny, and use prepared defenses on it to make it a 3.  I have 54 power with 5 TIEs and 2 dreadnaughts, not bad.  He loses the rest of his ships except the Home One.  End of game basically, we timed out since I couldn’t probe his hidden base (11 systems on table between us).  I have more cards so I win the game.<br/>
<br/>
Timed win by 22<br/>
1 (-1)<br/>
<br/>
Well now I’m looking up a little, I had a funny game with Girard and a great matchup with Gavin who has come along way in our tough environment.  So we go to the next round, I play Justin Beal, yippie, I’ve played him in every tourny we are both at.  It is fate that he must play me and Girard.<br/>
<br/>
I’m playing my Training, vs. Endor Opps.<br/>
<br/>
First thing in my mind, (GET OFF TEST 1)  He goes puts down emperor at the bunker puts down ominous rumors, sacks numbers cruncher for perimeter patrol, and its my go.  I put down everything first turn but test 1, there are 4, count them, 4 tests in my force pile (7 cards).  That’s all the force I had so its his turn.  For the most part he got a couple drains off, and tried to do search and destroy but I had honor of the jedi, and the turn it would have got me, I dropped boshek, tawss khaa, bron burs, melas and EPP luke, I play with aliens because perimeter patrol and none shall pass suck.  A couple turns later I got lando with ax down and that was about it.  I had test 5 done with a 7 on it, and between a stick, excluding someone, and test 2 I felt pretty good.  Unfortunately, I don’t know if time was up or not, but I would have gotten him in one more turn.  I end up with another timed win (starts to think this is about as bad as all the byes I’ve gotten) and get ready to move on to what lies ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Timed win by 23<br/>
<br/>
2(+22)<br/>
<br/>
I’m thinking, I’m still pretty low so I might play a random guy again.  Garrison goes Kitani vs. Arthur, great, a great guy, and one of my arch nemesis.  <br/>
<br/>
My TIEs, vs. docking bay stuff with Mains<br/>
<br/>
As always our games are amusing.  I’m playing Ties, he’s playing rendezvous point with docking bays and mains, go figure its Brett.  I get merryjk out and kashyyyk with a tie.  End of turn.  Kitani goes, gets docking bays DEMOTIONS merryjk, who does that, DEMOTION, first turn.  Btw I had to do a all power lost to get a tie and lost off of top, so long U-3PO.  I go, drain happily and have to draw up to find systems now, that sucks because later on I felt the power of a grimtash.  3rd or 4th turn he puts out obi-wan and gives him his stick via gift of the mentor.  I come down with EPP vader and clear the site with a arica undercover just incase I don’t.  I clear the site.  He comes down with Corran Horn, go figure, its Kitani, (the true magician of getting whatever card he needs).  Ends up having Jedi luke with stick and friends there,  I battle with first strike and ghhhk next turn.  Basically it came down to he found demotion, Corran Horn and Grimtash when he needed to.  What a drain race.  Another close game between us as always..<br/>
<br/>
FL by 2 ,just 2!! Ahhhh<br/>
<br/>
Total ending day<br/>
<br/>
2 (+20)<br/>
<br/>
Sadness:<br/>
I  went a whole tourney WITHOUT, WITHOUT WINNING a single full game.  This has never happened before, (1 reason I posted this report).  This is unreal.<br/>
Playing Girard again.<br/>
Playing Kitani again.<br/>
Not finding seinar against kitani till like turn 7.<br/>
Grimtash<br/>
TIMED WINS<br/>
And last but not least..TIMED WINS<br/>
<br/>
Goodness:<br/>
I like my TIE deck and its still tournament worthy.<br/>
I can train and feel better about myself getting test 6 out.<br/>
Remembering I can pull Daughter and deploy her in one turn to layeth beatings<br/>
Remembering I can put EPP vader down where U-3PO is to smack down guys.<br/>
Improving my tracking skills.<br/>
Having great games with great company.<br/>
<br/>
Patrick Hug got first, me roomie so congrats since he was pissed it took an hour to get to the tourny instead of 10 mins.  When a freeway is cut down from 5 lanes to 0, uhh, yeah that sucks.  In our star wars community we sayWAAAAA!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Until we meet next time grass hoppa<br/>
