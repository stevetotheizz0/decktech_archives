This one is easier to read.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it*s a Saturday tournament, so I*m hoping that a couple more people come out to this tournament then last. But no luck. We get exactly 8 players that are able to play so it IS sanctioned. Pat Napier, Dwerek Mower, and Thomas Harris are the ones to look out for.<br/>
<br/>
My decks today are :<br/>
<br/>
LS : Pod Profit &amp;#8211; hasn*t lost a tourney game yet<br/>
DS: Brangus cheese crap that I will never play again.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1 My PodProfit Vs. Caleb Schnarr (1656) Watto Mains<br/>
<br/>
My starting hand sucks and Caleb makes a comment about how good his is. Great. Well, he is racing aswell, and ends up winning it 25-27. We exchange force drains (me having Battle Plan on Table) and force loss due to both of our flipped objectives. I finally make my way over to Watto*s yard and hand him a chop with EPP Luke to flip his obj. But wait, he is still draining for 2 w/ the Emperor at the Cantina which whithers me down to about 15 force, until I draw a Qui-Gon to take care of Empy, which I promptly do. I finish him off with drains.<br/>
<br/>
FW 11<br/>
<br/>
So I*m standing at 2 +11 and Pat is the leading DS right now.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Good and fun game, Caleb.<br/>
Lows: Losing the race and nothing much more. Good game over all.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2 My Brangus Crap vs. Pat Napier*s (1747) HB Flip<br/>
<br/>
Great. The one deck Brangus can always lose to is HB. Oh well, maybe I would bet lucky. I win my race cause Pat does not even have a racer, but he ICBWed the damage. This was a boring game, as is all games against HB Flip. I can*t security Precautions and Qui-Gon is sitting on the Arena so I can*t S and Destroy. I finally PooP his objective so I can actually draw up cause he*s Kessel Running a lot.<br/>
<br/>
FL 18<br/>
<br/>
So I*m now at 2 &amp;#8211;7 and I believe Derek Mower and Pat Napier are at the top.<br/>
<br/>
Highs : None, I hate HB<br/>
Lows : Playing against HB<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3 My PodProfit Vs. Will Prather*s (1656) Ralltir Ops<br/>
<br/>
I start Ounee Ta and that helps my activation a TON. This was the shortest game I have ever played. First turn I Double Agent Mara and kill Dr. E to flip. He deploys Janus to Ralltir in which I deploy Qui-Gon and Saber. He loses Janus and some and I drain him out after finding out that you CAN*T Sorry About the Mess your own characters. That sucks. <br/>
<br/>
FW 48<br/>
<br/>
Yes you read it right 48 !! Sorry Will. I*m at 4 +41 and Pat and Derek have to play again.<br/>
<br/>
Highs : Getting a fun game in with will.<br/>
Lows : Beating him beyond belief and finding out that you can*t SATM your own characters.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4 My Brangus Cheese Crap that I am Trashing Vs. Caleb Schnarr*s (1656) HB Flip<br/>
<br/>
Great, another HB Flip. Well, he wins the race by one and I lose 11. This game sucks like all HB deck games do. He drains and I lose. <br/>
<br/>
FL 32<br/>
<br/>
Highs : None<br/>
Lows : Playing 2 HB flips in one Tourney. ;(<br/>
<br/>
I end up at 4 +10<br/>
<br/>
Derek won cause he was undefeated and Caleb got 2nd by going 3-1<br/>
<br/>
