<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Finally the Montana State tournament has come and gone. I have been looking forward to this for a number of weeks because I havent been to a tournament that has had any real competition since DecipherCon. I was expecting a couple of players to show up that didnt (namely Tyler Franks, that slacker ; )  ). We eventually had around 24 players show up to the tournament. After waiting for people to show up, people to fill out deck lists, and get teams formed for the team competition we eventually start around noon (suppose to start at 11:00).<br/>
<br/>
Since I didnt really know what to expect for the meta I decided to take the most balanced decks that I could find which were ROps (of course) and Faulke style hidden base. Both of which are shown below.<br/>

<br/>
Round 1 Game 1<br/>
<br/>
My Light vs. Nathan Stahley (1547) Docking Bay ISB<br/>
<br/>
I start HB stuff with Wise Advise and he starts ISB with IAO. On his first turn he searches for Hoth: DB and lays Cloud City: DB from hand and draws. On my first turn I search for Bespin and lay Alderaan from hand and draw. On his second turn he searches for Yavin 4:DB and lays Defesive Perimeter and Imperial Decree from hand. Also puts Narlax and some other ISB agent to the Perimeter and flips. I search for Chandrilla and draw a couple. Next turn I take a drain of 3 while draws. On my turn Obi comes down for a suicide counter flip by hitting one agent and he has to loose the other one to attrition while I loose Obi to attrition. On his next turn he lays Chyler, 2 Imperial ISBs and 5D6 to the Defensive Perimeter and flips. I am generating quite a bit of force and having saved some I drop Obi, Luke, and Orrimaarko to DP and clear the site while I loose Luke. Also put RL in R1 to Bespin to establish my space presence. He saves a while and draws here and there while I continue to drain and set up small stuff while getting safe cards into my hand. At one point he puts out Executor to Gold Leader but I barrier so he drops Boba but doesnt have enough to battle. I drop Super Falcon and draw 6, 5, 5 for destiny and clear out the Executor and Boba. His last attempt to set up a drain was ECC Bossk and ECC 4-LOM to the CC:DB but I elis Orrimaarko, Tawss Khaa and Jeron Webb and take out 4-LOM but he capture Tawss and Bossk can stay. He sees that he cant win a goes to draw up and I flip when he has one card left. I only have OMDH in my lost pile when I win.<br/>
<br/>
Result: FW 2(+40)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Round 1 Game 2<br/>
<br/>
My Dark vs. Josh Wendt (1802) Fake HB with Celebration and OMDH<br/>
<br/>
He starts HB and Wise Advise and I start IAO. On my first turn I put out Spaceport DB and the Swamp and draw both Hoth sites ; ) . He puts out Tatooine and searches for Alderaan. Next turn I put out the Desert to Ralltiir, lay the two Hoth sites and draw. He lays Mos Eisley with EPP Leia there. Turn three I lay Coruscant and Meditation Chamber and draw. He lays EPP Luke to Mos Eisley and Grimtaashes used. On turn four I still have enough stuff to flip even though the used Grimtaash and I have no fear because Luke and Leia are both at Mos Eisley and Nabrun is basically a non-factor. He fortifies Mos Eisley with EPP Obi and put RL in R1 to Tatooine. I save. He drains and puts out a bunch of effects including Savrip. I deploy Devastator, Bossk, and Zuckuss to Tatooine and try to Alter Savrip but fail. He loses RL in R1 and about 6 cards to Savrip plus 2 more. From then on I have control and few skirmishes on Tatooine between Vader, Tarkin, Mara, Luke, Obi, and Leia happen but I drain and attrition him out because I am eventually able to get rid of Savrip.<br/>
<br/>
Result: FW 2(+21)<br/>
Cumulative: 4(+61)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Round 2 Game 1<br/>
<br/>
My Light vs.Jay Morse (1734) Hunt Down with Holotable drain and high destiny Duel<br/>
<br/>
I start with Wise Advise and he starts Hunt Down stuff with Epic Duel and no starting effect. I cancel Visage on the first turn and we both spend the first few turn drawing and me putting out systems. He slows me down by used Monnoking me. I decide to make the first move by putting RL in Red 1 to Kashyyyk. He drops Vaders Shuttle with Vader and I barrier it. I now do not have to worry about being dueled any more because I will not kill Vader while he is in space. We both set up drains and I Transmission Terminated his Holotable and eventually claw is biggest drain. We are about 10 turns into the game and we both have about 20  30 cards left and he says, well, I think that I am going to draw up because there is nothing else I can really do. What the hell!? So he draws up and when he gets to one card I flip and hes like, what? I tell him that there are still things that I can do, and he asks what so I tell him I can retrieve my entire hand and lost pile while he can do nothing about it because Battle Plan is out so he cant drain and can only move one ship at a time. I feel like a @#$% but this is States so I retrieve everything and only OMDH is in the lost pile when I am finished.<br/>
<br/>
Result: FW 2(+36)<br/>
Cumulative: 6(+97)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Round 2 Game 2<br/>
<br/>
My Dark vs. Jason J-3P0 Dennee (1779) Faulke style HB with a lot of modifications<br/>
<br/>
He starts Wise Advise and I start IAO. Im sorry but I dont remember a whole lot of details from this game. I flip early and he starts to harass me with EPPs and he does a good job of flipping the objective back. The objective must have flipped back and forth about 6 or 7 times during the course of the game. However he starts to run out of EPPs and is force to flip and I am able to finally keep my objective flipped. After probing every system I finally get his HB and attrit most of ships away while keeping a constant drain on the ground and making him lose some to Search and Destroy. One of the better plays were when he put Legendary Starfigher on the Falcon after loosing all the pilots from it so I had to loose two force when I could do nothing about it. He forgot to cancel drains with HB a couple of times and forgot to make me loose to Legendary Starfighter a couple of times. But overall it was a solid game.<br/>
<br/>
Result: FW 2(+16)<br/>
Cumulative: 8(+113)<br/>
<br/>
Round 3 Game 1<br/>
<br/>
My Dark vs. Jason Welch (1463) Throne Room destiny adding mains<br/>
<br/>
Decide against a Crush start and go with IAO which would be a good call as he is only playing one Revo. In my opening hand I get 3 of my generic sites (suck). I search for the last generic site and see that I have activated two 2/0 locations (damn Im good). He plays his Nudges and draws. I convert his Swamp and Bubo has lunch. He stacks characters at the Farm for a couple of turns while I flip and set up some space stuff. I am activating a ton of force because I have drawn into nearly every location I have. At one point he tries to Nabrun during the control phase but I remind him of IAO. He has no space presence so drains at Coruscant and Kashyyyk go uncontested. Only 3 battles the whole game. The first one Vader, Tarkin, Ozzel, Watts and Marquand in TS2 take on Obi who got clashed, Luke, Chewie and Leia. He plays Rug Hug. He loses all his guys while I loose all except the TS2 crew who take out Obi soon after. The last battle Mara took on Han and Leia where he forgot to play an I Know he was holding in his hand. My drains do him in. However I have a ton of cards on the table and only win by 13.<br/>
<br/>
Result: FW 2(+13)<br/>
Cumulative: 10(+126)<br/>
<br/>
Round 3 Game 2<br/>
<br/>
My Light vs. Jason J-3P0 Dennee (1779) ROps<br/>
<br/>
He start IAO and I start Wise Advise. This was basically a reverse match up from round 2 game 2 earlier. I wasnt able to make him flip back and he was able to attrit away nearly all of my battle forces. I wasnt able to get a lot of activation early and be Monnoked away my Obis, which was a big part of my potential hit squad. Not a whole lot to tell except that ROps is really, really tough to beat.<br/>
<br/>
Result: FL 0(-15)<br/>
Cumulative: 10(+111)<br/>
<br/>
We I finally got in some solid games and was still able to win after such a long playing break from the game. The team that I was on, House of Smack, came in second to team Steve. I came in first while teammates Patrick Miller, Jason Welch, and Ken Allen cam in 5th, 7th, and 8th respectively. Steve team members took the 2, 3, 4, and 6 spots.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning after the long absence and networking with some of the better players in the state. Deck choices working how I wanted them to work. Entering the tournament I had a 1875 rating and now should be pretty close to 1900 or over.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lows: Late start. Long drive (4.5 hours) home after the tourney. And feeling like a @#$% after round 2 game 1. No trophies yet.<br/>
<br/>

10(+111) Me, Faulke HB / Akesson ROps<br/>
