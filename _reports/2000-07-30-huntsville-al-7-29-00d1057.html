About a week ago a friend of mine, Brandon Ruck, asked me if I would like to go down to Huntsville and play in one of Jim Colson's tournaments. I said "Sure. Why Not?" because I hardly ever get to play in Nashville since I'm always the one running the tournaments. And as a plus my girlfriend Maura (who has a passing interest in SWCCG) wanted to play too. It seemed like we would have a blast on saturday.<br/>
<br/>
The night before the tournament, I decided to make a new Light Deck that didn't suck. I laid out all of my deck building stuff and my rares and looked at the clock. 2am. Thats cool, I'll be done in an hour and I'll get plenty of sleep. 6 Hours later, I still don't have a decent Light Deck. So I slap some crappy Train to 6 deck together and try to stay awake till it was time for us to leave. No dice. I pass out on the kitchen table with my cards. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
The Decks<br/>
Well my dark side was a Bring Him Before Me deck that concentrated on ground pounding. It usually had a hard time with Hidden Base but did very well against There is Good Against Him and other Mains Based decks.<br/>
<br/>
The light side was a Train the Boy up to Test 6 and watch the fun ensue deck. This deck was not fun to play with at all and I quickly found out that ROPS kills this deck dead.<br/>
<br/>
The Tournament<br/>
We get to The Deep about two hours before the event started and Squadron Member Matt Reed is there. We play some friendly games and I win with my dark deck by 35 and lose by 4 with my light. So I'm thinking my Light is decent after all. After we wrap up the last game Jim Colson (the TD) shows up and gets us registered for the tournament and it starts...<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
My DS BHBM vs. Taylor Clap (1500) LS Tatooine/Hoth Deck<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I sat down against this kid, I knew I've got the game won. He couldn't be more than 8 years old and I didn't want to destroy him in the game. He starts Jabba's Palace and no starting Interrupt. First turn I suck out the Death Star II docking bay and the Emperor from reserve to Jabba's Palce first turn. On his first turn he drops Beru and Owen to Jabba's Palace and draws. He comments that he knows it's a long shot that he will win that battle but it doesn't matter. My turn. I activate and suck out a &lt;&gt; Docking Bay to Tatooine and run the Emperor away from the Elderly Couple. I say something like "I don't think that Palpy can take both of those guys on." And I draw up and score a Lord Vader. The game was pretty much like that the entire time. The Only characters I had on the table the entire game were Palpy and Vader. It was all I needed.<br/>

During that game Jim Colson told me he had to leave to goto the airport and pick his brother who was flying into town and run some errands. He asked me if I could finish the tournament and before I said yes !POOF! Jim was gone. Oh well. Drive two hours just run a tournament. Funny Stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
My LS Train the Boy vs. Chris Bentley's (1902) DS ROPs<br/>
<br/>
I've known Chris for a while now but this was the first time I ever got to play him. We joke about how bad ROPs sucks before the game and we get our opening hands. I don't know about his hand but mine was pretty damn good. Training Area, 1st Test, Boushh and other good stuff. Deploy Yoda  and Hut from reserve. Lay down the training area and get another test in hand. Then I end my turn. He drops Tempest 3 I think and Arnet plus sucks out 3 locations on his turn. My next turn I suck out of Reserve SOS, Luke's Stick, Luke's Back pack, Yoda's Hope and another Dagobah site. I drop Test 1 knowing that I have already completed it. That was about the only thing I did the entire game worth mentioning. Chris drains the crap out of me on Raltiir, I mess up On the Edge with Boushh and she dies, TK-422 gets trampled, Suicide EPP Obi got creamed, I insert Anger, Fear, Agression never pops, I noble sac Nein Numb, I never see general Billy Dee, and Search and Destroy was my ass. On the bright side Luke became a Jedi.<br/>
<br/>
My deck sucks.<br/>

Game 3<br/>
My BHBM vs. Maura Chace's (1485) EBO with Launching the Assault<br/>
<br/>
Well it never fails. Any time I play in a tournament with my girlfriend I always seem to end up playing her. She starts talking smack to me and we get started. We both groan as our opening hands suck ass. I activate 4 and search for my friend Palpy... He's not there. Damnit! So I suck out the Endor docking bay and Emperor's Power. I drop Davod Jon at the docking bay and end my turn. She sucks out her sites with ANSB and gets everything she needs to start EBO except the characters to drop at the Echo sites. It takes her three turns but she drops Obi, Orimarrko and an Xwing to fullfill the requirements for EBO. She drains in space and I have Your Destiny working for me. She later sucks out Luke with BHBM and throws him at Vader. And now Im taking 1 force loss a turn. I drain on the ground and she drains in space. A Close and Very Good Game.<br/>

<br/>
Each time I play her or see her play it blows me away how fast she learns and how quickly her game is improving.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My Crappy Train SOS vs. Robert Martin (1503) This Deal is Getting...<br/>
<br/>
I would have to say that this game was probably the hardest game I've played in long time. He tried to get Dark Deal set up but before he could he lost it due to all my Anger, Fear, Agressions. I get Luke up to Test 5 pretty damn quick and as test 6 comes down Luke goes up to the hand. He drains away at Cloud City and Bespin while I wreck his guys at the Carbon Chamber and the Docking Bay. I use all of my retrival to keep me in the game due to Ability x3 and his drains. In the end Boushh, EPP Obi and SOS stand Victorious on Cloud City.<br/>
