<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">okay...the last report kinda ended abruptly, so here’s the rest:  <br/>
<br/>
saturday was continentals day 2.  the details were this:  <br/>
<br/>
i took 7th??? (maybe 8th???) who knows.  i played like a moron.  either way, it was...Chu and scott diehl in the finals.  from what i could see, chu played his brangus deck first vs. diehl’s RST podracing.  i think chu won the podrace, but diehl blew up the bunker.  maybe he didn’t, but at one point i looked over, and chu had like 2 cards in his lost pile...and the next minute i looked over and chu had like 15 cards in his lost pile.  but i think chu got "the combo" on him (responsibility/much anger) and ended up winning by 20 or so?  maybe?  the second game was chu’s WYS vs. diehl’s tie bombers.  i wish i had gotten a look at the tie deck he was running, but whatever. i left at this point to go take a shower...don’t ask, but i guess chu won by 30 or someting.  <br/>
<br/>
sunday was sealed deck day, and we all popped our packs.  it was really pretty silly.  i got maul x2, senate objective, 6 senators, the "reduce battle destiny by 3" effect, the "increase drain by 2" effect, 2x rachalt hyst, 2x gun to play on rachalt hyst, and a few sites, etc...random cr@p.  the real kicker was that i pulled 3x podrace collision, boonta eve, teemto’s podracer, podrace arena, watto’s box, AND NO PODRACE PREP!  wtf.  i can’t pull ONE common card...ick.   on the lighter (or darker) side, i pulled the blockade flagship 2/0 site.<br/>
<br/>
game 1 vs. some guy from manitoba.<br/>
<br/>
this guy started with shmi’s hut, and i got some guys in the senate for a 1st turn flip.  he does alot of drawing while i get out a couple 2/1 tat. sites (i started with "his name is anakin" so he had to save some force).  he puts qui-gon at watto’s workshop, so i have to send maul and some other monkey.  i use yeb yeb al thorm to look at his top card, and it’s a 3, and i have the "reduce by 3 attrition" senate effect, so i can eventually beat qui-gon off the site without losing maul.  i draw a six for destiny and i’m able to track it for the next battle.  i drain him out a turn later.  i win by 19<br/>
<br/>
game 2 vs. eric olson<br/>
<br/>
i’m like "hey look, i’ve got maul x2" and he’s like "hey i’ve got qui-gon and his stick AND watto’s workshop AND credits will do fine."  if he gets quigon, then there’s more or less NOTHING that i can do to get rid of him except try and duel him...but olson doesn’t fall for it, and ends up draining me for 4/turn at the workshop.  i lose by 9?<br/>
<br/>
game 3 vs. chris praskac<br/>
<br/>
he says "my deck’s a pile" and i’m like "darth maul in your hole" and he gives it a go, but i’m like ...sure...i win.  can’t blame someone for getting cr@p.<br/>
<br/>
game 4 vs. brad stebbins<br/>
<br/>
toonbuck toora, yeb yeb al thorm, and some other mofo in the senate spell disaster for brad.  i think i make about 5 or 6 cards lost by using yeb yeb (he’s a machine from he11) and keep him from drawing destiny high enough to knock maul off any sites with ki-adi-mundi.  i end up draining him out and winning by 12 or so.<br/>
<br/>
so i’m 3-1 with + 30 or some low dif. like that.  olson whiffed his 4th game against the "podrace w/the box" guy and ended up in like...3rd or 4th, but the final is clint vs. dude with box/racing.  can you guess who won?  YES you can.  NOONE CAN BEAT WATTO’S BOX IN SEALED DECK.  blah.<br/>
<br/>
SLOPS FOR THE WEEKEND:<br/>
<br/>
1) joe gianetti for trying to convince some kid that he couldn’t use anakin’s podracer because he didn’t declare it.<br/>
<br/>
2) joe gianetti for trying to docking bay transit to a star destroyer launch bay (even though it’s not a docking bay) and trying to argue with the judge about it.<br/>
<br/>
3) joe gianetti for calling judges over for like 30 other rulings while trying to cheat out some scrubs.<br/>
<br/>
4) joe gianetti, while playing in sealed deck got this kid down to two cards with battle order out...and just sat there and retrieved 1 force at the marketplace, until the kid called the judge and says ’is there anything i can do’ and the judge is like ’you can draw up’ so he did...but it’s still pretty g@y.<br/>
<br/>
5) joe gianetti for saying "i played against this kid in sealed and i asked him if he minded if i retrieve my whole lost pile and he said it was okay so i did."  what a jack@ss.  he can’t even lie well.<br/>
<br/>
6) joe gianetti for being the ONLY person i’ve turned luke against while playing my BHBM deck in a tournament.  what a scrubby mofo.<br/>
<br/>
7) joe gianetti for getting caught rubbing cards on his crotch and winning mich. states like a chump.<br/>
<br/>
8) joe gianetti for having someone say "that guy may think he’s Fonzi or something, but the hair just doesn’t match-up" about him in their tournament report.  heh.<br/>
