Before:<br/>
So the week starts off with crap by me having to present a report in my science class which is like 50% of my grade.  I finish that up and seems like the week will never end but Friday finally comes and my tourny prep begins.  I start off by meeting up with Chris to play a few games and go to see if the other member of our crew is planning on going.  So we head down to the local store to meet up with Brandon.  He tells us hes probably going to go stand in line to get Survivor Series tickets.  We then go to our rides house and see what time hes going to pick us up and so on.  We wanna get something to eat and go to Dennys BUT dont get the BROWNIE.  HAHAHA.  After we head home and sleep I then awake and head off at 10:30.<br/>
<br/>
We arrive and wait around for a while fill out cards and get started.<br/>
<br/>
16 people showed up this week which is a good turnout<br/>
<br/>
Decks:<br/>
LS: EBO Standard with super falcon/7 other ships<br/>
DS: Bring him My way or the highway(same as last week ill post if you d-mail me)<br/>
<br/>
Off to the games:<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
LS vs Andrew Mewis Court Dvader/walkers<br/>
He starts off court which is a surprise to me and I have never played against this deck before.  He starts off by pulling a tat dbay and drawing up.  I have echo dbay in hand and pull War room and Corridor activate play my sites, honor and Rend Point also and draw to set up my hand.  His turn he pulls generic dbay and then plays LORD VADER with a saber to it.  I thought it was odd but oh well.  Heres where I screw up.  I activate and forget all about ebo so I ask him if I could go back and get it he says no so I just say whatever and start to get ready to set it up.  I play KFC, nein and firgan with gen cal and falcon with squadron assign.  He drains me for some and plays a walker.  I hit him for 1 and get my ebo this time.  I play keffix and play haven with Red Leader in R1 move nein up and move to keffix.  He drains plays no escape and draws some more.  I hit him for 7 play Leia to Cantina and Corran to ac which he got when he played jp.  He plays ds613 and some abilty 2 scub battles draws a 1 and I draw a 3 so he loses 1 guy and move vader with ds613.  I hit him for huge drains that turn play Meance fades and give him the go.  He hits me for a few moves vader into the AC.  I play Obi, Wedge to back up Corran battle hak vader hit he misses obi I cancel he loses vader and about 6.  We battle a little bit but the drains are too much in the end.  FW(+24)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Huge drains are cool but im not really liking this EBO<br/>
Lows:  Forgeting to search when I could have had EBO 1 turn earlier<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
DS vs Mike not an @$$ Mendoza EBOX/Rouges<br/>
Well I played Mike last week and he beat me all across the board so im gonna get revenge.  I start off pulling rendilli activate get D* dbay with emp and janus there.  He starts up with just his 3 sites(1 from hand) and thats it.  I hit him for the drain for 2 and draw up some.  He gets EBO and the garrison getting Zev and Wedge.  I drain play Vader to Endor dbay with a saber.  He plays Commander Luke with his obj and I barrier which helped me a lot but sets up EBO and a Incom Corp.  He takes 3 from Your desinty and 2 from drains canceling 1 with Rebel Fleet.  He drops 2 x-wingsto my rendilli and saves a few.  I decided to take my chance with with Zuckuss which he barriers but I back him up with Bossk and a lateral.  He loses the non lat x-wing and a few I have to lose bossk.  So lone zuckuss GREAT!!.  He plays organized attack for 3 x-wings deploying them to Rendilli and playing honor.  Battles I play projective which means he cant move Luke to Endor dbay now but I lose zuckuss and about 6.  I hit him for 1 from YD and a few to drains.  We are both getting low on force now.  He drops a rouge and decides to just move luke to north ridge.  I hit him for a few drains drop Iggy and to N Ridge and Dengar with a Dreadnaught to Hoth against 1 lat xwing and 1 non.  Battle on the ground cap luke flipping my obj but he doesnt get bd because its Wedge on rouge 1 so he stacks 1 making that 2 now.  I battle at hoth killing off those and a few.  He hits me for a few more drains but in the end I have a few more force than he does. FW(+9)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: FINALLY beating him<br/>
Lows: Zuckuss getting smacked<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
DS vs Paul McKelvey HBX/Odds<br/>
Well Ive played this in a fun game and beat it because of fast damage so Im preety confident.  I get regular start with emp to D* dbay.  He plays some systems and draws some up.  I hit him for 1 play janus and pull some sites using janus to get my hand set up and tracking going.  He sets up some more systems and with rebel fleep to delay my damage.  I play Vader with a light saber and search and destroy which hits him the rest of the game.  He gives me luke But still keeps taking from search and destroy.  I drain for 2. And set up the hand more getting all the stuff I need to stop him.  He gets his 5th system out and flips on my turn when I drop presence to Clakdor 7 and sec precautions for the damge probe with zuckuss, dominator and a dread.  Got it for 9 more.  Hell breaks lose now.  With 5 xwings with s-foils open and incom.  He plays Eject Ejectt on Zuckuss but misses(thank god).  Battles I lose everything and about 6 more.  Search and destroy still.  Drain him for somemore.  He decides to spread out.  I deploy Bossk against a lone wing and coursant with a lateral battle for the x and about 6.  Bossk drains some search and destoyer hits.  A ending battle of Dengar and Bossk against 2 x-wings for 22 to 4.  FW(+20)<br/>

Game 4<br/>
LS vs John Monroe ISB Imp Command<br/>
Well great in top seat with worst deck.  We start off buy just searching for stuff and getting the activation up he plays Ad Piett to exe dbay for his mob points and getting merijck.  I grab some sites and play Corran to exe dbay kill piett.  He saves up force but draws a few.  I set up some more with another site and fig dan.  Forgetting to drain 1 of about 25 mistakes I made this game.  He has enough so he comes with Vader igar and blizzard walker.  I play edge on Corran for 6 and miss to aviod the battle.  He moves vader to his Yavin 4 dbay.  I set up ebo that turn with some scrubs but dont have enough for any ships.  He drains I play lost in wilderness on vader placing him missing.  I get my space drains going with super falcon.  Hes draining for 1.  Hes canceling my drains with Den of thevies.  He takes some offense with Chimera with a few guysagainst lando in pulsar skate(dont ask) I hyper escape to hoth.  He follows me still negating my drains even more.  I drop haven with liberty, tantive, spiral and mirrax battle and clear out Chimera.  From then on we really dont have much battle just more of a chess ships match with him canceling my 1 drain I get off so I preety much in lock and end up dieing.<br/>

<br/>
Highs:  Not Much<br/>
Lows:  Getting all my drains either canceled or blocked<br/>
<br/>

Ls vs James Bottomley SYCFA ties<br/>
Well standard ties him starting with D* War room and Wakumiui.  I set up hoth with some sites and Rend point.  He saves some force and deploys Endor which helps my activation.  I get the last site out and deploy figran and KFC.  He plays 2x sythe squadron ties and Dreadnaught to Endor.  I set up some more with a system and ebo going down draw up some.  He drains I play surprise assult beating him by 1.  My turn super falcon han, leia come down to kill everything but sythe squadron getting Lendary Starfighter which hits the rest of the game.

<br/>
Game 6<br/>
DS vs Steve Daniel On/Off Hidden base<br/>
Well I havent played Steve since about 4 monts ago in Modesto.  I start off normally with Rendilli and Emp to D*dbay.  He goes hardcore with Luke with saber battles misses hak and loses battle for a stack.  I play mara for some back up but no saber in the deck.  Obi wan comes down hits mara but loses another battle.  I get mara back with No escape and Vader to Endor Dbay with a lightsaber and Janus with Emp.  He gives up Luke but loses a 3rd battle to IG.  So Im gonna go cross Luke.  I move my guys to the DS2 dbay he plays Ben Kenobi and pays about 9 to get him to DS2 dbay and says your gonna win anyways.  I battle with slash for Ben and about 11 + a 4th stack.  I move over and cross Luke with a Dengar in P1.  FW(+30)<br/>
