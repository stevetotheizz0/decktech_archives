<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">miscommunication is something that plagues me constantly. <br/>
<br/>
in my 3rd game of the DPC Normal, i played against Erik Petersen.  in my TR i addressed my disappointment in how long our game took.  Erik and i resolved that problem soon after our game.  i was not angry at him, for sometimes games do take time, but i was just angry at timing out.  it’s not his fault.  i hold no grudge.  i haven’t thought about since the DPC until it was brought to my attention tonight.<br/>
<br/>
retracting what i stated (as the truth and as what i felt to be true during the game) would be inaccurate, or so i believe.  <br/>
<br/>
forgetting to include in my report that Erik and i communicated to each other post-match about my disappointment was my mistake.  the issue was resolved then and there, and i thank him for not allowing that wound to fester.<br/>
<br/>
sometimes (okay...quite often) i’m a pretty bad sport if i feel i didn’t get a good game out of it.<br/>
<br/>
hey, i apologize.  any comments?   <br/>
<br/>
(i’m probably leaving something out, but try not to crucify me for it....that’s the miscommunication talking again) </font></td>
