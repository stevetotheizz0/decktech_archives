<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Lot’s of controversy at this tournament surrounding<br/>
the prize of the not yet released foil japanese vader.<br/>
<br/>
it was given as a raffle of sorts with first place getting<br/>
the best chance to win and last place getting a chance,<br/>
it ended up going to 5th place.<br/>
<br/>
anyways.  i get up, head to mc’donalds and buy<br/>
two breakfast buritos, end up at the card shop<br/>
at 9 am.  mike crawford(5th place) and little brian<br/>
green are there, i buy brian an oj, and james t arrives,<br/>
we are allowed inside moments later.<br/>
<br/>
the whole crew arrives, and at about 10:05 we<br/>
begin the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
ROUND 1 GAME 1  <br/>
<br/>
my light side ebo against Zach Stenerson’s Hunt Down.<br/>
<br/>
my light is a version of deadbolt.  used prep’d defenses<br/>
for strike planning, battle plan, and insurrection.<br/>
started mpg and include 3rd marker for later.<br/>
<br/>
i don’t remember what zach started with, but i knew<br/>
that I would have to get my ebo up, and drains up.<br/>
<br/>
i grab crix, deploy him to war room, and start grabbing<br/>
scouts, geezum grabs extra sites and ketwol finishes<br/>
up my three, i have ebo up in 2nd round.<br/>
<br/>
i win some battles in space and pull off legendary,<br/>
other stuff happened too, but eventually, I win by 9.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add more detail, but for the life of me<br/>
the shock of beating zach is too much.<br/>
<br/>
highs, beating zach<br/>
lows, can’t think of any.<br/>
<br/>
ROUND 1 MATCH 2<br/>
<br/>
My tie deck against brian herold’s agent’s deck.<br/>
<br/>
i slap him around, and well, my tournament report is sucking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the moral of the story is, I beat zach twice, and<br/>
brian herold once and lost to him once I got third!<br/>
