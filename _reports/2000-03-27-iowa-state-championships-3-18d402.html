<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">	This is the story of the Iowa State Championship as told by Seth.  I started seriously testing decks for state about two weeks before the tournament.  I&amp;#8217;d settled on a Corulag Opps. Manipulation for dark on somewhere around Thursday of the first week of testing.  I played about ten games with it against local people and didn&amp;#8217;t lose once.  So, it&amp;#8217;s now Friday before the tourney starts and I still have no idea what I&amp;#8217;m going to do for my light deck.  I turn to Decktech and decide to use a modified version of the Dagobah X-wing deck.  I meet several other people at Burger King the day of the tourney and we play a couple of games.  The Iowa City people show up, and I trade for a Kiffex that I desperately needed.  We went over to Mayhem Collectibles and filled out our decklist.  There were 35 people including Gregory Reid, Brad Gregg, Shawn Banwell, and Nate Ponce.  On to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 DS vs. Sam Peterson&amp;#8217;s Tatooine Pile<br/>
This kid was only about 8, and I didn&amp;#8217;t see any non-premier cards in his deck.  This appeared to be his first game.  I started fairly fast, flipping second turn and shutting down his drains.  The first couple of turns, he just activated and didn&amp;#8217;t draw even though he had no characters in his hand (I scanning crewed them all.)  He eventually gets a Shivistanian Wolfman and Kabe to the Cantina. Next turn, I drop DVDLOTS and battle.  Choke the Shiv and draw a 3 for battle destiny.  After that, its just me draining him for 8 a turn and him doing nothing.  Full win by 41 2(+41)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Winning by 41, beating on Kabe, not losing a force the entire game.<br/>
Lowlights:  Beating on a newbie, now I&amp;#8217;ll be set up to loose to Greg or someone.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 LS vs. Brad Gregg&amp;#8217;s Kiffex Opps.<br/>
He is my mentor and one of the top 5 players in Iowa.  I draw a dream hand with OTE, both my arconas, and Boushh.  First turn: Acitvate 7, Deploy Yoda&amp;#8217;s Hut from hand and Swamp from reserve deck.  Deploy one arcona to where he has an opp and something else.  Deploy Order to Engage from hand and draw all but one.  Second turn: Deploy Yoda, the other arcona, play the signal for TPTIFF and deploy that.  Next turn he flips his objective.  I don&amp;#8217;t depoly any systems so he can&amp;#8217;t get to Dagobah to cancel TPTIFF.  I take over his Kiffex and deploy Boushh and Rebel Fleet.  For several turns, it&amp;#8217;s just me draining for one at Kiffex and him losing 3 for OTE.  He deploys Endor and two bounty hunters in ships (Zuckuss and Dengar) which I rebel barrier.  On my turn, I drop several X-wings (but not enough to make my destiny not 0) and battle.  I don&amp;#8217;t draw (Curses!!!) to his 7.  His turn: he moves over and cancels TPTIFF.  I play AWRI and retrieve 10 somewhere in there.  He plays Hutt Smooch, capturing Boushh.  OTE and my drains of one kill him.  Full win by 31 4(+72)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Beating my mentor, getting a dream hand.<br/>
Lowlights: I wont be able to go to Star Wars night for a couple of weeks until he cools down (if he cools down)<br/>
<br/>
So, I&amp;#8217;m in first after two games and I&amp;#8217;m set up to fight someone really good like Greg Reid.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 3 DS vs. Travis Winters Profit deck<br/>
He is from Iowa City and pretty good.  He&amp;#8217;s a pretty cool guy and a great sport.  I&amp;#8217;ve tested against profit several times and always one so I&amp;#8217;m pretty confident.  I get play scanning crew 3 times on my first turn and get rid of all his rebels and draw 3.  On his turn he draws till he has 12 cards.  On my turn, I scanning crew once or twice and deploy an opp with a guy and draw.  He activates and plays a lost Grimtaash.  Damm! Two opps and two scanning crews gone.  He gets a alien out and springs Han.  On my turn I draw and get an abyssin ornament, an opp, Boba in bus, Bossk in Bus, some biker scout and M&amp;#8217;iyoom Onith.  On his turn, he deploys some rebels that&amp;#8217;s I couldn&amp;#8217;t scanning crew and some ships to Courlag and deploys Battle Plan (or Order, I can never remember.)  On my turn I deploy Bossk, Boba and battle him.  I draw a 3 to his 1.  My power 17 to his 10.  I loose Bossk from attrition and he looses both his ships.  On his turn he deploys some ships to Corulag and moves them to my Coruscant.  My turn.  I drain him (for free!) and play Abyssin Ornament looking for an opp.  There&amp;#8217;s not one in my reserve deck.  Arrrggggh!!!  Oh well.  I deploy M&amp;#8217;iyoom and an Opp.  Draw and let him go.  He activates and announces his drain.  I remind him that he no longer occupies a battle ground system, so he decides not to drain.  He deploys the Tantive IV and a 2/2 pilot to Corualg.  He draws up to 12 cards.  My turn.  I drain and use M&amp;#8217;iyoom&amp;#8217;s text for 12.  I kill 5 or 6 unique rebels including 3 Master Lukes and a Ben Kenobi.  I deploy an opp and a biker, flipping my objective.  I initiate battle against the Tantive IV and he reacts with the Spirial.  Unexpected this is, and unfortunate.  I draw a 3 and he draws less than 4, so Boba lives.  I kill the Spirial from attrition.  By now, things are getting pretty close.  On his turn, he leaves Corulag for Coruscant.  We drain back and forth for a while, and he drains/uses flip side of profit to kill me.  Full loss by 11  4(+61)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Travis is a great guy and it was really fun playing him.  I slowed him down a lot with scanning crews, screwed him with M&amp;#8217;iyoom and kicked him off Corulag.<br/>
Lowlights:  I lost.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs. Mike Jordal&amp;#8217;s Weird Ass Huntdown Manipulation.<br/>
This is one of the weirdest decks I&amp;#8217;ve seen in a long time.  He started Battle Order.  I get Yoda to the hut on my second turn and start spreading out to drain in space.  All he did early was deploy Barquin Dann at the Holotherater and start retrieving one with that.  I can&amp;#8217;t find either of my Trans. Terminated, so were both losing from that.  He deploys Your Eyes Can Deceive You on my lost pile and starts plyaing fear, which I grab.  He gets out Zuckuss in MH and Boba in Slave and starts battling/force draining me with them.  I play All Wings Report In to get a Xwing and he plays a lost Voyeur.  I finally get a Trans. Terminated and cancel Visage.  He deployed M&amp;#8217;iyoom Onith to the Holotheater somewhere in there.  I deploy Boushh, break cover, and battle.  I draw a zero, so he loses a force.  On his turn, he re-deploys Visage, deploys Vader and battles.  This time I draw a two so he looses M&amp;#8217;iyoom.  I loose Boushh.  After that, its me loosing from Visage and his drains in space and me paying for a drain of one or 2 per turn.  Full loss by 11 4(+50)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  I canceled Visage&amp;#8230;eventually&amp;#8230;and then he re deployed it.  Pushing his Fear.<br/>
Lowlights:  Everything else<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 vs. Brian Speiker&amp;#8217;s HB Asteroid Sanctuary<br/>
I&amp;#8217;ve played this deck last summer and lost pretty bad.  But this time, I knew what to expect.  He starts Yarna and never went over 12 cards all game.  I get a fairly fast flip and slow down his drains.  He gets a sanctuary going at Anoat with 3 asteroid fields and the big one.  I start getting my big drains going (10 or 12) a turn and repeatedly bounce his TK422 and Boushh with Scanning Crew.  He gets another sanctuary going at Kiffex (I think.)  He flips and on my turn, I guess his Hidden Base correctly (it was Roche, the one I used to use.) I move my Fett in Slave to Kessel to block his drain there.  With about 10 cards left, I play Abyssin Ornament and retrieve 6.  Its getting really close now, but I think I can pull it out.  I loose 13 next turn to drains/sanctuaries.  I now have 3 force left.  He deploys another ship to Kessel and battles me there.  I draw a 3, so my power is 10 to his 16.  I loose Fett and TWO!!!  On my turn I drain him for his last 9 force.  Full win by 1.  6(+51)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Winning, not letting him get his undercover spies out, blocking the drain at Kessel, probing his hidden base on my first try.<br/>
Lowlights:  Those Sanctuaries were killer.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs. Anthony Hendon&amp;#8217;s Huntdown on Endor<br/>
He won the last tournament that I played in, but I&amp;#8217;m confident I can do well against a Huntdown (IF ITS NORMAL!)  I start my usual stuff and he starts Security Precautions on my Dagobah.  My opening hand has Uncontrollable Fury, the Swamp, a few xwings and some red stuff.  He deploys a Endor site and draws.  On my turn, I go to search for my Dagobah site.  It&amp;#8217;s not there!  So he takes about 5 minutes to look through my deck muttering things to himself like: &amp;#8220;Hey! This is a good deck!&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;That could hurt.&amp;#8221;  As he hands me my deck back, he tells me that its going to be a close game.  He was right.  I draw and get my Yoda&amp;#8217;s Hut, Boushh, and RLiR1.  On his turn, he deploys Vader and his saber.  On my turn, I deploy Uncontrollable Fury on Vader, Yoda and the Hut and draw for a system.  On his turn, he gets another deploys another drain site with a tempest scout (I don&amp;#8217;t remember which one) with an AT-ST Pilot.  On my turn, I deploy Boushh where the walker is, and a couple x-wings to Kessel.  On his turn, he deploys Zuckuss and Boba and battles me.  I chose not to draw destiny because I don&amp;#8217;t have enough ability.  I loose an xwing.  On my turn I move my stuff to Tatooine and draw my Trans. Terminated to cancel Visage.  For a long time its us draining each other and my Uncontrollable Fury hitting him for 2.  I get an Arcona to where Vader is, and deploy Order to Engage.  He plays alter and draws a 1. Argggg.  Soon he gets another site out and starts draining me there too.  I keep draining and he redeploys visage.  He tramples Boushh (drew a 5) and gains the upper hand in the drain race.  He drains me out full loss by 5 6(+46)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Very fun game, getting Uncontrollable Fury in my opening hand was awsome.<br/>
Lowlights:  Him looking through my deck on the second turn.<br/>
<br/>
So I went 3-3 again.  I placed 13th.  Nate Ponce from Iowa City beat Gregory Reid twice in the final two games to take first place.  Shawn Banwell had the highest differential of the two people who went 5-1, the other being Brad Gregg.  Greg Reid placed fourth.  I got a pack of Cloud City and Premiere for prizes.  Larry Hutson had a bunch of revised R-3PO s that he picked up at DecipherCon and gave everyone one of those.  It was a great tournament and I had the most fun I&amp;#8217;ve had in a while at one.<br/>
