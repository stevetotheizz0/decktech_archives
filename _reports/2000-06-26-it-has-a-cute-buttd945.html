<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Time is beginning to get closer and closer to the Tatooine Regional and I need practice.  4 tournaments scheduled between Friday and the Regional and I plan on playing in everyone of them.  <br/>
<br/>
Friday night I go to Michael Sinclair's apartment with Big Daddy Girard for some play testing.  I beat up on Nibbles with a Yavin IV Throne room deck and then run my Set Your Course deck against Girard and his beast.  The beast was wearing the daddy pants that game I can tell you.  I figured out what to change and what to play and go home and make the decks.<br/>
<br/>
LS - Girard's Canadian Beats Deck, with my on Flava'.<br/>
DS - Set Your Course Deck that upsets people.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning Nibbles picks me up and we go and get Sinclair and drive down to Tucson.  Sinclair sleeps the whole 90 minute trip and I sleep for about an hour.  We get to Kards 4 You and wait for the rest of the players.  I trade a Gen. Solo FOIL and a Ben Kenobi to the store for a box of Endor for prize support for my tournament the 15th of July, then sell 6 random Chewies to the store for $35.00.<br/>
Then we play.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 LS vs. Doug Roan DS Asteriods TIES Deck.<br/>
<br/>
Doug hadn't been playing very much, but had a good idea for his deck.  he got some asteriod fields out and some TIES draining, but making him lose Force for his Dark Manuevers and then beating on Lone TIES with Capt. Han, ECC Chewie in the Facon was too much for him.  I had a good steady drain of 3 going on at Coruscant and then a drain of 2 at Kashyyk and kept blowing his TIES up with Asteriod Destiny.  I drained him out.<br/>
<br/>
FW +23<br/>
2(+23)<br/>
<br/>
After this game I went over to were Sinclair, Brett Kitani, Nibbles, and Enrique were talking.  I find this Pokemon key chain sitting in front of Enrique and ask him about it.  He says..."I saw it in Target and thought it was cool...and it has the cutest butt I have ever seen on a key chain...." that was pretty funny....<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 DS vs. Patrick Gimber's LS Profit/Elom Swarm Deck.<br/>
<br/>
Patrick is one of the better players in Tucson and he had a pretty good idea for a deck.  I started with Mara Jade and Miiyoom Onith at the Audiance Chamber and Security Pecautions.  I scan his hand first turn and ECC Lando gets a free ride to the lost pile.  I deploy a system and a Death Star Site and let him go.  He picks up his first turn and I get to go.  I drop Bubo at teh Audiance Chamber only after I scan his hand and then Monnok his 2 DFTD.  His next turn he drops that Jawa that can Gamble and we start Dune Sea Sabbacing.  He wins the first game of Sabbac and then Bubo gets to eat.  He had dropped two Eloms at the site to try and kill Bubo, but forgot to save Force so he couldn't pay the one for the attack.  Bubo decided that the Audiance Chamber was not in Las Vegas, so the Gambler must go, and ate him.  On my turn I drop Fett in Ship at Endor and move Mara and Miiyoom to Jabba's Palace.  Bubo then went on to eat 4 Eloms, Jedi Pack Han, a Tessek, another Gambling Jawa, and a Gran.  I drained him out with a drian of 7 coming from the 4 systems and a drain of 3 at Obi-Wan's hut.  It was a fun game having Bubo control the Audiance Chamber.<br/>
<br/>
FW +32<br/>
4(+55)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 DS vs. Kenyon Elletson's Jedi Test Retrival Deck.<br/>
<br/>
I had never played him, but he was playing next to me during game 2 and told me his deck.  I was happy at that point.  I got CBHYC and Secret Plans turn 2 and then fortified the drains in Space.  He passed all of his Jedi Tests, but the systems were the only Battle Grounds on the table and he would have been smeared at any of the systems if he attempted to deploy to them to satisfy the CBHYC for retrival.  He didn't have any LS Mains in his hand the whole game, thanks to Scanning Crew and Monnok.<br/>
<br/>
FW + 30<br/>
6(+85)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 LS. Andy Marchantel's DS RalOps.<br/>
<br/>
After game 3, Michael Sinclair was first and I was second.  However, we both played the same side, so he had to play Brett Kitani, whom he beat in Game 3, in Game 4.  I played Andy, who is from the Phoenix area and is getting better with every tournament.  He starts RalOps and I start with MWYHL.  I get Boush blocking on of his drains on Rallitir and then drop Melas, EPP Luke, Orrimarrko, and Boshek on the Space Port Docking Bay.  He deploys two more genaric locations to Rallitir and moves walkers over to them, but Projection of a Skywalker at each of them saves me from any Force Loss.  Uncontrolable Fury was deployed on Vader and Super Falcon went to Coruscant to drain for 3.  He dropped Bossk in Houndstooth there but I killed him quick and deployed Legendary Starfighter, so now he was losing 2 from Fury, 2 from Starfighter, and 1 from my drain.  Anger Fear did its work on him too, and I finished him off by adding a drain of 1 at Rallitir with the Tantive IV and Wedge.<br/>
<br/>
FW +26<br/>
8(+111)<br/>
<br/>
Brett beat Sinclair during my last game, so I had to win and I would win the tournament, and I did.  It was only my second ever tournament win, and it felt good, due to my getting abit nervous going into the prep work for Regionals.  I won an IG-88 ECC pack and some random packs, which all go to my prize support stash.  <br/>
<br/>
Nibbles drove us home and I hung out with my girlfriend that night, ready to play in the Sundat AZ Gamer tournament the next day, which Sinclair said started at 1pm.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday I get up at 12:00pm and call the store to make sure the tournament starts at 1pm.  Sinclair tells me that they just started and that he can give me the bye if I show up by 1pm.  I shower and get dressed and make it there by 12;50pm, just in time to see Girard beat Nibbles.<br/>
<br/>
So Sinclair offers a bye, but I tell him that I was late, so give me a 0(0) for game one.  I then get to play cards...<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 DS vs. No one...I was late...<br/>
<br/>
0(0)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 LS vs. Nibble's HDADTJ deck.<br/>
<br/>
We pick up for a couple of turns and then he puts out that Endor site that adds a drain of 1 if an Imperial was present, and puts Presence of the Force on it and says go.  I put Yoda at his hut and say go.  He drops Darth Vader and his stick at the Endor site and flips, Visage not being a problem due to me canceling it turn 1.  I activate and draw up some cards.  He then trys to drain me for 4 at teh site, but I play Lost in the Wilderness, but miss.  My turn I give him Uncontrolable Fury and say go.  He trys to drain me again, but I get him with Lost in the Wilderness this time, making Vader lost and flipping his Objective back.  I get a drain of 3 going next turn with EPP Luke and Orimaarko at that same Endor site and a drain of 3 at Coruscant with Super Falcon.  He tries to kill my guys at Endor, but Yoda deals away the attrition.  Super Falcon became a Legendary Starfighter after Zuckess in Mist hunter drew a site for destiny and he chose to los it instead of 5.  I won, he lost.<br/>
<br/>
FW +23 or so.<br/>
2(+23)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 LS vs. Aaron McCormack's DS RalOps.<br/>
<br/>
Aaron and I have played against each other so many times recently, that we are pretty tired of it.  He gets Vader down to the Forest with Presence of the Force there to drain for 2 and Boush blocks the drain.  He captures her and then I go at him.  I insert Anger Fear a couple of times..drain at Coruscant for 3 then 2 for a couple of turns, but he converts the system, which was rather rude of him.  I send a couple of EPP Lukes at his 2/2 Imperials and knock him off his locations, with Fury doing 2 damge every turn.  I won with Fury and Starfighter.<br/>
<br/>
FW +28 or so.<br/>
4(+52 or so)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 DS vs. Girard and his LS Beast.<br/>
<br/>
We had played this same game 4 times before this.  I hate playing him and the beast.  I scan him turn 1 and he has a Shocking waiting for me...that hurt.  I drain for 2 at Kiffex for a while, smacking Luke out of the Falcon.  I get Hoth out and drain there for a bit...but I Anger Fear and Vision did me in...but I am getting better against the beast.<br/>
<br/>
FL -17<br/>
<br/>
So I finished 4 (+30) or so.  I took 4th.  I had fun and am pretty confident with myself for Regionals.  I have 2 more tournaments this weekend, and then it is off to Vegas.<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>
