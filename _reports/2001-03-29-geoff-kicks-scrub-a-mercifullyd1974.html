<br/>
the kids came out to play today, so i arose from my decay<br/>
to meet them at their silly game, i came i saw i played the same<br/>
<br/>
as always i brought the blitzkrieg II, the hidden phil, and lando too<br/>
strike planning i start for every matchup, i eat them alive like burgers w/ketchup.<br/>
<br/>
game one i play against a little kid, who starts with the throne room (he’s really catering to my id)<br/>
no other starting stuff on the table, this kid can win? he doesn’t seem able.<br/>
<br/>
"why’d you play that starting interrupt?" i say, "you’ve got no starting effects to play?"<br/>
"oh" he says...looking on in woder, "i guess in this game i’m going to flounder"<br/>
<br/>
needless to say he pays the price, for "hidden phil" is not so nice<br/>

<br/>
game two this kid named tyler plays me, i see he’s got profit and it doesn’t phase me.<br/>
my BHBM is going to jack him, there’s walkers on Tat. and he doesn’t like ’em.<br/>
<br/>
EPP vader makes an appearance, of the audience chamber he causes a "clearance"<br/>
leia, luke, han, and a bomarr, they all get smacked up...much to the delight of Komar<br/>
<br/>
...who’s standing there watching me beat the hell out of this guy, i’m really afraid tyler’s going to cry.  <br/>
<br/>
oh well<br/>

<br/>
man i’m getting sick of writing like this.  it’s totally a chore.<br/>
<br/>
game 3 vs. Brad Augsburger’s TDIGWATT<br/>
<br/>
not sure what to expect from this one, since the carbonite chamber is his start, as well as All Wrapped Up, and i’m sure there’s some "all too easy" crap in his deck.  i go to bespin with falcon, he does nothing.  i go to the carbonite chamber with orrimarko and crix.  he comes to get me, i play It’s a Twap!  and he’s like "dammit" so i know he’s got all that "all too easy" crap in his deck....although it’s not too painful because he’s not flipped.  nothing really happens, so for the next few turns we just play cat and mouse back and forth from the casino to the carbonite chamber.  he’s lucky i’m giving him so much force from kessel and coruscant, otherwise he’d be doing even less than he is.  he does manage to drain me down to about 12 before i drain him out (he probed my base).<br/>

<br/>
game 4 vs. some guys Bothuwai Operatives<br/>
<br/>
whoa!  i haven’t seen this in like...ever!  good thing i start with battle order, eh?  well he puts out like ONE site, drops a bothan + operativer there (i think it’s the forest), and puts a bothan in my throne room.  Lord vader smacks up the TRM bothan for about 9 cards, and a walker w/ two pilots takes over the forest, hitting them up for another 3 or 4 cards.  scout jedi deploys and does a bit of damage to my walker, but i come back with another walker assault for a few more cards.  jedi scout REAPPEARS to attack me at the Bothuwai &lt;&gt;docking bay, but before his battle phase he attempts to play NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS!  whoa!  i’m like "your total is 1, and mine is like..5" and he’s like "oh i didn’t notice."  this guy obviously thinks that Inserts auto-damage you for like 10 or something?  who knows.  you can take a wild guess at how this one works out.<br/>
<br/>

8 (+95)<br/>
<br/>
game 5 vs. tyler’s Black Sun Ops<br/>
<br/>
this would be interesting, since i have no idea what to expect.  xizor moves over to the &lt;&gt;docking bay on coruscant, and i’ve got an OOC in hand w/epp leia...BARRIER, and then guri and xizor whack leia for 3 cards.  i’m kinda behind right now, so i signal for HotJedi and get out some more systems.  luke and orrimarko go down to coruscant w/ crix and they sit in front of xizor/guri/bossk/ig88 and i play It’s a Twap!...he sits there and i sit there, and i put more guys there, and he puts more guys there, and i play It’s a Twap! again, and now i’m firmly embedded on coruscant w/about 6 guys..occupying a bg site, and i have control of coruscant and kessel so i flip and start draining for alot..<br/>
he comes to space a bit, but i kill his stuff...he keeps draining me, but now he has to pay for battle order, and he can’t draw up because of hidden base...<br/>
i retrieve like 15 from OMDH and win.<br/>
<br/>
fw +35<br/>
10 (+130)<br/>
<br/>
game 6 is my BHBM against brad’s Hidden base w/stuff (i don’t know what kind of stuff).  he starts by like throwing out a few systems...kessel, kiffex, bespin, tatooine, aquaris, and i put my &lt;&gt;docking bay at kiffex w/a walker contingent.  executor comes down w/3 pilots to beat up wedge for 3 or 4.  lando in gold 1 gets smacked by another spacefleet, gling1 gets beat up by bossk, and then i move emperor over so i can start adding a destiny.  obi wan, protector wookie, and orrimarko come to get my walkers, but i draw a 6 and a 2, so obi wan dies.  epp vader and blizzard 2 come down and along with blizzard walker w/ds612/ds613 they all beat down chewie and orrimarko for about 12 cards.  i eventually control about 4 locations with LOTS of stuff and am draining for like 7 or 8.  he can’t keep up, and can’t retrieve because of CHYBC, so i win.<br/>
<br/>
fw +25<br/>
12 (+155) (or something like that #...i don’t remember too well)<br/>
<br/>
so what do i get for winning?  foil obi wan.  blah.  i’m not playing in this cr@p anymore becuase they all get discouraged....so i’m like "why don’t we all go up to chicago this weekend and you can try your luck against some of the kids up there" and they’re like "yeah right...we suck"...so i’m gonna be the good guy this time and drive around the kiddie mobile.<br/>
