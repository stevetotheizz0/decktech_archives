<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok here is my second try at writing this report.  Sorry but this is only going to be about the games...NOTHING MORE.  I lost my huge, really cool report..with much humor, and since that really sucks hardcore. Oh well.  I still feel like writing something so here I go.  This will be the Open only because I have little time before work.  I just wanted to thank all those who came with me on this trip...sorry I am making to short.<br/>
<br/>
My decks were LS WYS and DS Huntdown Machine<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 MY LS vs Brian Garrison’s Maul Mains Rating 1744<br/>
<br/>
I lost to Ted Hansens version of this during Playtesting so I was worried, but I had what I needed in my hand and beatdown Vader with 23 overflow.<br/>
Full Win by 23<br/>
2(+23)???<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I finished this one fast enough to get a beer at the bar, which I made time for alot :)<br/>
Lows: I really don’t remember any of my Dif’s So I will stay modest.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 MY DS vs John Hawkins New Age Revo Rating 2070<br/>
<br/>
This game took a really long time because of the match up.  I didn’t give him any battlegrounds, because I am not stupid, and he only had one...which was the Casino, I had Come Here you Coward, and the Ghhhk Effect out...so there wasn’t much either one of us could do.  This game I could make very detail, and how I did things, like How I used Evader/Monnok...which I had two Copys of.  But I am to lazy to write all the detail...long story short, if I drew Elis he would have lost to my force...because I would have cleared out the Casino...His only way to make me lose force was from Sabacc...Perfect Sabacc that is.  Oh well.  <br/>
Full Loss by 11<br/>
2(+12)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:Not much...John is a nice guy, but he thought I was going to stall...which I would never do.<br/>
Lows: I know I should have won...I needed two cards to win..Elis and Sniper...but only activating...a little was a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My DS vs Tom Kathman’s Harvest Mains Rating 1957<br/>
<br/>
I heard this guy was pretty good from someone...But I had everything I needed in my machine of a dark.  His Name is Anaikin Rocks...and I had nothing but Dark Jedi everywhere, he forgot about Leia not being able to Battle with Huntdown flipped, which really messed him up...anyway I win.<br/>
Full Win by 33<br/>
4(+45)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:Quick and Easy<br/>
Lows: Too Quick...I had to drink 2 beers to pass the time :)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 MY LS vs Doug Faust Court Rating 1778<br/>
<br/>
Well Doug is underfeated and so is Hawkins, and Christy, and Paul???Sorry Paul I don’t want to try to spell you last name.  Anyway I play Doug, and clear the Chamber out early in the game with the help of Protector canceling Boelo gametext...with like 8 overflow.  He drew Zuchuss as destiny...I thought he was going to use his Court Text to get Zuchuss to Tattooine to battle, my lone Mirax, but he didn’t.  He waited until he drew the ship.  Either way I take space with some overflow damage at well.  TunnelVision just makes sure I have what I need all the time, and this games ends quick with me winning.<br/>
Full Win by 23?<br/>
6(+68)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I never did lose to Court before with WYS<br/>
Lows: I thought I should have won by more, but ah well<br/>
<br/>
Christy wins his game by only one, but that was with his light...he will have his Machine of a Dark play the same guy to win again.  Hawkins wins, and Chu Wins, and a new round starts.  It will be Christy vs Hawkins, and Me vs Chu.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 My DS vs Jonathan Chu’s MWYHL directdamage Rating 2260<br/>
<br/>
I start Effect Grabber, No Escape, and Crush.  First turn I monnok and get two Visor Vision.  He is where my luck really sucked for me.  When I monnoked him I see Uncontrollable Fury...I have 3 Lord Vader’s in my deck.  I quickly get Come Here you Coward out, so he will not be able to retrieve with his Podracing.  Everyturn I use Crush to look at my deck and see if I can activate Lord Vader...well guess what it takes like 6 turns until I finally activate him and set up in the Cantina.  That was 12 force loss from Visage, and 6 force lose from the Podrace later...and finally I get him out.  Damn that sucked.  He start to insert AFA to make me lose 4 and use Effective repairs to keep doing this.  This is his only way to make me lose force.  Until he deploy Obi and Luke with Sabers with set up draw with the help of 3PO to kill Vader. I choose not to swing, because that way my draw will only kill one of them, and I can’t satisfy AFA that will come up next turn.  He forfeit OBI which he knew was a mistake, because then I get I have You now out from Reserve, and deploy Maul With Saber, and I seen that my destiny look good, with bad luck I will miss this swing.  Ok so I battle, I swing and I miss... SH IT...damn my luck.  I play I have you Now anyway, and Luke dies with 3 overflow, when if I hit him it would have been Luke and 10 overflow.  Ah well.  AFA kills me and my own Visage hurts us both, until the end.<br/>
Full Loss by 11<br/>
6(+57)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: It is always a pleasure to play Chu...he is honest.<br/>
Lows: Chu beat me twice so far, I guess he owns me.<br/>
<br/>
Dan won his game against Hawkins, to make him the only underfeated player, but he has to play him again.  I end up have to play Eric Bruen.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 My LS vs Eric Bruen’s Watto stuff Rating 1937<br/>
<br/>
Eric and I played once before at some Mega Tournamet in Cali that I won complete set of Uncutt sheets, but other than that we just kind of ran into each other at these big events.  He seems to always to well at them.  He needs to win this game against me, because he has a chance at the final.  I however do not have chance but I guess I will play for Glass :)  I play it safe the whole game...I decide To go to space with a huge force and I also decide to lose 2 instead of letting him deploy stuff for free...until late game anyway.  I did get a beatdown on the Prince with like 8 overflow, which pretty much gave me the win.<br/>
Full Win by 12?<br/>
8(+69)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: This tourney is over.<br/>
Lows: I guess I will have to play at Day 1 at Worlds, My luck sucks, but my skill rocks :)<br/>
