<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Greetings everyone.  Thanks for reading my report.  Peter Sundholm ran this 3 round event in Olympia this past weekend, and we had a turnout of 11 players.  Endor notibles Walter Zylowski, Derek Snook, and Myself, Charles Hickey were in attendence.  So it looked to be a few interesting games toward the end, if all the pairings went as expected.  I ride down with Snook, discussing past T.V. shows such as A-Team, and debating what kind of bunk to play for states.<br/>
<br/>
So, we arrive in Olympia, looking forward to the games, and Mongolian Grill afterwords.<br/>
<br/>
My deck selections for the day were, Rallops for the DS, and Profit for the LS.<br/>
<br/>
Onto the games:<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  Profit Vs. Tom Thomas Ralliter ops.<br/>
Tom chooses not to start anyone in the chamber, which is fine with me.  I get set up very quickly, rescuing Han, and having him with Ben Kenobi on Tatooine.  Masta Luke and Boush go wreck some Havoc on Ralliter, and I stop him from ever flipping.  Drains and direct loss do him in.<br/>
FW by 27<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Taking control early, having evasion when I needed it.<br/>
Lowlights: Beating Tom, he's a cool kid.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2. Rallops vs. David Kitzman throneroom main, no nudj.<br/>
Well, I start Imperial Arrest Order, cause I know he's Nambrum Boy.  Woo, did it pay off.  I activated, and got my hand set, then with 20 force saved, I deployed and flipped.  This game was in my control from here on out.  He never contested, cause he deployed everyon to CC, deciding to Nambrum, but forgot about I.A.O.  I invade Yavin, and drains do him in.<br/>
Fw by 21 4(+48)<br/>
Highlights:  Not much, it's a bad throneroom deck<br/>
Lowlights: Canceling Frozen Assets with Main Course, and putting the card in my lost pile.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3.  LS vs. Ghery Pettit Huntdown<br/>
Ghery chooses to start no Aliens, and that's fine with me.  Goo Nee Tay really slows him down, and I get Han rescued turn 2-3 with Ben Kenobi.  He set's up a drain of three with Tempest 1 and Mara at an Endor Site.  So I drop down a Mechanical Failure to Ewok Village, and go.  Ghery Drains 3, and I surprise Assault, but only make him lose 1.  Bummers.  So, Ghery fortifies the Walker with Ozzel and Dr. Evezan.  So, during my turn, I nabrum Boushh to the fortified site, and Sorry Ozzel.  I then Double Agent Mara, but fail.  Next, I deploy Masta Luke, and Battle.  I weapon Lev Maras sabre, and bounce Dr. E.  I draw a 5, and it's one that I retrieved from my flip, so I knew I had another 5 coming, so Leia Capped Mara.  So, Now it's just Luke and Leia against the damaged walker, and I play Skywalkers.  TP=19, to ghery's 0.  This was game.<br/>
FW by 30 6(+78)<br/>
Highlights:  Deck worked perfect.<br/>
Lowlights: Ghery is in a slump.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4.  DS vs. Walter Z's hidden base Kessel run deck.<br/>
I get some sites early, and flip with out him contesting me.  I skirmish him a bit in space, but once I get out location^3 and Ability^3 with Search and Destroy, Walter is losing 5-6 force a turn cycle.  I pound the last of his forces, and the direct damage is his death.<br/>
FW by 15 8(+93)<br/>
Highlights: The changes I made to compensate worked perfect.<br/>
Lowlights:  None, but I thought he was playing numbers early, so I dug for Vesden<br/>
<br/>
Game 5. LS vs. Derek Snook's 'Suck This Profit!'<br/>
Well, I'm activating 4 force, to his 10+, I get no characters or locations, and he get's set up.  This was an uphill battle the entire game, with Force denial, and Secret Plans.  So I can't wait to release Han, he has like 12 people in the Chamber, and I know he's sitting on Hutt Smooch.  Well, I finally walk Lei in, and spring his ass.  But My evasion is not showing up at all until this point, and he's content with the chamber and occupation.  I make him lose some, and he does to me.  Han gets Eaten By Bubo, cause my Fallen Portal missed, and it just crapped pout on me.  So, I start fofietig dudes in the chamber, just to make him lose to No disentigrations.  Well, I lose, but this is a game I could have won, if I had gotten a location earlier, and some evasion cards.  But a good damn game nonetheless<br/>
FL by 15 (8+78)<br/>
Highlights:  I finally got to test Profit against Tatooine Occupation<br/>
Lowlights:  Profit lost, ARRRGHHHHH<br/>
<br/>
Game 6.  DS vs. Derek Snook's Hidden Base deck.<br/>
Well, I get set up, with an Early Search and Destroy, and Start contesting him in space with my Flips.  I get drains in, and kick him out of the good systems, and have decree going in effect.  Dereks drains are reduced to crappy, and I have the location and Search and Destroy Going.  I probe, and he loses like 2 foce. (alot of systems on table)<br/>
FW by 14 10(+92)<br/>
Highlights: Revenge against Snook :-)<br/>
Lowlights, nothing, except him capping Zuckis in Ship. . .Again. (but I knew it was comming this time!)<br/>
<br/>
so, I finish in second, behind Walter Zylowski, who decided to win his last two game by huge differential, while I played against Snook.<br/>
