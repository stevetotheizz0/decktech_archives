I’ve never been to Geneva for a tournament so this would be new.  Kuperman is avoiding me by getting his butt kicked in New Jersey and I think Schaefer is on a religious retreat to lower Indonesia so we’ll see who shows up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know all of 1 of the 16 people in the tournament.  I’ve got my Jedi Profit deck for light and Hunt Down Podracing for Dark.  Numbers is no good so I’ve got a couple mean characters to fight in the Hunt Down deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
Hunt Down vs. Mike Maciejewski QMC Space deck<br/>
<br/>
Mike is very new.  He got overly excited when I traded him an Oola before the game.  He lost 11 from the Podrace, 4 from a fight with Luke, 16 from the Visage and 26 from drains.  Quick game.<br/>
FW 2 (+44)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Sheesh I won by alot<br/>
Lows:  Sheesh I won by alot<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
Jedi Profit vs Stefan Behr SYCFA Ties<br/>
<br/>
Stefan wasn’t going to play in this tournament until I loaned him some cards before the game.  I didn’t know the kid, but he seemed ok.<br/>
<br/>
He gets Merrijk to the Death Star and out come the systems.<br/>
Naked 3PO gets pulled with Seeking an Audience and I start to cycle through my entire deck.  Qui-Gon frees Han, but not before Altering the Sienar Fleet Systems.<br/>
<br/>
The Podrace is going well for me and Tie Interceptors start coming down in masses.  It’s a drain race, but I sense his attempt to Twilek for the Fleet and a couple Short Range Fighters are lost from losing the Podrace.  <br/>
<br/>
Jedi abound on Tatooine and Home 1 finishes off Kiffex for the win by 30.<br/>
<br/>
FW 4 (+74)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: SAC beats Ties, even with TINT/OE in play.<br/>
Lows:  I’m in the zone.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
<br/>
Jedi Profit vs. Peter Behr Hoostino Hunt Down w/ #’s<br/>
<br/>
This kids got a T-shirt that says "Your Deck Sucks"  I get the brothers Behr back to back.<br/>
<br/>
I think the numbers should be out for a Maul + stick or two.  this can go a long way when Vader has to come down early to flip, Mara and Maul can be back up to come down for a beat.<br/>
<br/>
I start YCHF and numbers are out.  On turn 3 I’ve got 3PO, Artoo and Jedi Luke out so my numbers are 15.  I should be playing odds, not him.<br/>
<br/>
The Podrace is close and Peter comes down with choke Vader to square off with Jedi Luke.  I know his destiny is obscene, but I’ve got a stick on Luke and two senses in my hand.  He starts the duel and I sense the Focused Attack.  Luke wins and the movie ends.<br/>
<br/>
Peter wins the Podrace, but I free Han and retrieve everything I lost.  All he’s got is the Emperor against 3 Jedi and I pull out the win with drains by 14.<br/>
<br/>
It was this close because of Visage and Counter Assault.<br/>
FW 6 (88)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
Hunt Down Fortman style vs. Peter Behr QMC<br/>
<br/>
It’s a rematch and I’m confident with this matchup.  I can let him Path from Vader once, maybe twice, but by then Maul better come down and rid the Mining Colony of Jedi.<br/>
<br/>
Sebulba pulls out to a commanding lead in the race and Boba Fett orbits Bespin first turn.  Peter get Dash up to Bespin and we fight.  No problem I’ve got killer destiny.  <br/>
<br/>
Apparently it is all sitting on the Podrace cause I draw a 2.  He draws a 1 so i just lose 5 force and prepare to fighht on my turn.  Vader drops down to Leia’s Hut and I fight in space.  Boba gets a 1 and Dash gets a 5.  I lose Fett and 4 cards.  <br/>
<br/>
This is not what I expected.  It’s turn 3 and I’ve lost 10 cards, Dash and Ten Numb are at Bespin and Bespin CC respectivly draing for 2.  Vader and his duel stick at at the hut draining for 1.  Next comes the great equlizer...<br/>
<br/>
I win the Podrace and here comes 11 my way and 11 his way, the hard way.  I’m back in the game with one race.<br/>
<br/>
Luke and Obi come down to CC in an attempt to set up Celebration.  Vader does the Epic Duel 2-step and I’ve got a Darkside EPP of my very own.  <br/>
<br/>
Next turn, Obi leaves and he takes 9 force with him.  Bounty Hunter clear the system/sectors and I get the win by 24.<br/>
<br/>
FW 8 (+112)<br/>
<br/>
Highs : Watto’s Box turns the game around 180.<br/>
<br/>
Lows : What the hell happened to my destiny in space.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
Hunt Down Fortman Style vs. Brad Stinton CC Mains<br/>
<br/>
   Brad is undeafeated along with me, but he’s just back from college and doesn’t have all the new cards yet.  He completely forgoes Podracing.<br/>
<br/>
I get the Emperor to CC along with Choke Vader.  Premiere Obi w? stick deploys to the Lower corridor.  I check my destiny with the droid 4,4,1. I move Vader over and chance a duel.  I’ve got no stick and he’s got one.  <br/>
<br/>
We tie.  Next turn Lando and Lobot come down with Obi and fight Vader.  Swing misses, but the power chases Vader away.  I draw for a couple of turns and the Race hits him.  I get everything back and he loses a ton of cards (is 11 considered a ton?)<br/>
<br/>
Vader + Duel stick comes down and Obi bites it the second time.  The old man takes his 9 cards and goes home to momma.  Maul joins Vader against Lando and Pucimer.  We both cover our eyes and when the dust clears, the two Jedi each have cigarettes lite and Brads deck is done.<br/>
<br/>
FW by 26, 10 (+138)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Another game, another dueled crazy old hermit.<br/>
<br/>
Lows:  It doesn’t matter how many Paths you have when you have to lose 11 to the Race.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
Jedi Profit vs. Brad Stinton YMSYL<br/>
<br/>
It’s rematch time.  I’ve tested the new Walker deck and It’s just a mad drain race against Jedi Profit.  Once again Brad ignores the race and Qui-Gon frees Han early.  <br/>
<br/>
Naked Threepio searches for my deck and I get 2 Monks out along with some SAC.  I get the quick lead in damage, but YMSYL catches up fast.  Brad is spreading out to 3 Marker sites, the DB, the Corridor and the War Room.<br/>
<br/>
Here comes a Garrison, Sense.  That saved me, he plays another since they are non unique, I sense it again.  The race is over and he loses 6.  He loses 2 more Garrisons from his deck and I said you’ve got 4 Garrisons?  He had been trying to get one from me.  He says he’s got six in his deck and my draw dropped.<br/>
<br/>
I activated like mad and got Threepio to find that same sense again.  His turn he Garrisons and I sense it.<br/>
<br/>
My turn I activate like mad and Threepio finds the sense again.  His turn he Garrisons for the last time and I Sense it.  I drain him out on my turn for a win by 21.<br/>
<br/>
FW 12 (+159)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I won by alot, but those garrisons scared me.<br/>
<br/>
Lows: All Brad had to do was start TINT/OE and I lose that game big time.<br/>
<br/>
I get a Maul for the win and I’m happy.<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
-Tony Maravola for trading me a maul for a Qui-Gon.  There are a million Qui-Gons in Chicago and no Mauls.  The distrib is messed up around here.<br/>
-Stefan for remembering to give back those cards I let him borrow when I forgot about them.<br/>
-Mike Maciejewski for pulling a Qui-Gon (what else is new) from two packs after he lost to me.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
-There’s nothing more sickening then Watto’s Box.  The 22 force swing lost only once and that was when Vader got dueled out of the game.<br/>
