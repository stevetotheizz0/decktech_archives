<br/>
Alright folks, the day starts out I’m over at Shaner’s place because I spent the night there after my Friday night warm-up.  We get up at about 9ish and leave 10ish to go to the store, pick up some cards and Robert Seymour.  I call shotgun, haha, me being by far the smallest person in the car.  We get down to Tucson at about Noon.  I play hearts with 4 people, yes a game of hearts with 5 people, really weird.  Anyhow I win that game so I know my luck has been wasted, time to eat at subway and get the tourny on its way.<br/>
<br/>
My Decks:<br/>
Light Side - Testing all the Way<br/>
Dark Side - TIE Rage/Set Your Course<br/>
Rating: 1782<br/>
<br/>
Both these decks are strong, but they don’t always win because I am "The" SW scrub<br/>
<br/>
First Game:<br/>
Me vs. Andrew Emmott’s Hidden Base (rating 1601)<br/>
<br/>
I have my sub sandwich and he’s not here yet, so even though everyone is playing for 5 minutes I actually get to eat.  This was good because I had no strength.  We start.  I get a good hand.  I drop Seinar, Wakeelmui, however you spell that, Merry, he drops Kashyyyk, I draw up last 2 cards.  He goes and says I should concede right now.  Apparently he was playing hidden base with just the home one and everything else was EPP rage/destiny adders.  Granted all his system said Force Drain -1, that sucked but my TIEs basically roamed free and I drained the heck out of him with my TIEs.<br/>
<br/>
FW +32<br/>
<br/>
Goodness:<br/>
EPP Vader is cool, especially with a permanent ghhhk on the death star.<br/>
A TIE for going over to Yoda’s Hutt to cancel a Stone Pile, that was cool.<br/>
Great conversation and laughs throughout the game.<br/>
<br/>
Sadness:<br/>
I played against a hidden base deck and really didn’t have a space battle.<br/>
Winning by so much I have to play a good person next round.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
<br/>
My Training Deck vs.<br/>
Shaner’s Ral/Ops (which is actually DJ’s &amp; very good) (rating 1907)<br/>
<br/>
This isn’t cool, I played DJ a couple weeks before and he beat me by like 16 or something, but this isn’t DJ, so he can’t play the deck as good since it isn’t his, so I hope<br/>
<br/>
Both of us had normal starts, his docking bay non-unique dudes, and me setting up camp at the green desolate planet.  Basically the turning point of the game was when Shaner put down Search &amp; Destroy.  This made me real mad because I hate that card.  Previously I had put down Ounee Ta, (good card).  He has like a biker dude and chicken walker stuff down there, vader at another site, and emperor at another with some crony.  I go, Melas, Tawss Khaa, Boshek, EPP Luke, and Lando with beat stick for 9 Force!!!!!  This was very cool.  I kick the crap out of the emperor and some other guy there, and start chasing chicken walkers.  I finally get off test 5 and do my retrieval thing.  Then I get the coolest combo, Bron Burs with a disrupter pistol, with a permanent 7, this guy is a beating.  For some magical reason I through down test 6, why I don’t know, but it didn’t do anything for the whole game until afterwards we figured out I can’t battle Vader, BIG Whoops, but if anything its one less card I didn’t get back.  Bron Burs comes on down, pops Vader and Janus takes it up the butt and says thank you sir may I please have another.  I ended up overpowering him and that was about it.  I also had Red Leader kill off the Chimera so he had to pay for his drains earlier.<br/>
<br/>
FW + 16<br/>
4 (+48)<br/>
<br/>
Goodness:<br/>
I beat a real good guy with a real good deck<br/>
I beat a deck I lost to a couple weeks ago<br/>
My rating is going back up I hope<br/>
Not starting Daughter or Yoda in my hand (long story, I always get 1)<br/>
<br/>
Sadness:<br/>
Not remembering the game text of Test 6, thou shalt remember that.<br/>
Shaner for initiating 3 battles and making me lose 6 force for Draw their Fire/First Strike before he died.<br/>
<br/>
Next round, yippie and guess who I get to play, Scot Vales, I told myself to put in numbers protection at the beginning of the tournament and I didn’t, Oy Vey.  Now its my turn to take it up the butt.<br/>
<br/>
Scot Vales Death star trash compactor/numbers/death star plans/surprise assault/A.F.A<br/>
Vs. little TIEs with no numbers protection (his rating 1640ish)<br/>
<br/>
Game starts out, I get my Seinar, I always start that thing, we have a real good relationship, I get it in my hand, and it gets to sit on the table and do some really cool stuff.  I put out Merry, get Kashyyyk and throw a TIE up there.  I don’t think he’s playing space so what the heck.  I also throw down CHYBC, this is the most amazing card, plus I start with Secret plans, no retrieval for you.  This was cool, because he tried to drain at the holotheatre, how bout no.  He gets Tawss Khaa down, and I’m like yes, no numbers, then he puts down EPP Obi somewhere and I’m like cool, but then he tries to do his retrieval thing.  I can’t let him do that.  Vader comes down, takes out Obi, and this cool card called Set for Stun sends Artoo on a trip and death star plans to the lost pile.  This was cool.  After that I did see numbers come back when Jedi Luke came down.  More so, I took a couple surprise assaults, but I have TIEs, I can retrieve some back, and I took a numbers up the butt for 12, because Twass Khaa was still down.  All in all the finish was amazing, I’m draining him like no other and I’m taking all this weird force lost.  Finally, He has 2 cards in hand, 1 in Reserve deck.  Throws down numbers, I’m like whatever, then goes Wars Not Make One Great.  I’m like, ewwwwwww.  Who plays that, I’m like, I want a war, lets rumble.  I have no hand and nothing else to do.  I figure he can drain me 1 or I could drain him first, so I active the one card, and I’m clean.  I drain I win. Whew.  I look down, and it’s the 4th card in, pretty close.  Close game, and I stuck it out.<br/>
<br/>
FW +16<br/>
6 (+64)<br/>
<br/>
Goodness:<br/>
Another good opening hand<br/>
I won a very close game without numbers protection.<br/>
Brandon for not being there and not saying I should have had a condom when I got it.<br/>
(rule of thumb, must include Brandon in a tourney report)<br/>
<br/>
Sadness:<br/>
Not remembering numbers cruncher in my deck (which it is now)<br/>
Vader for killing Obi, probably should have let him stay there so I would have had to keep about 5 force.<br/>
<br/>
This is good, now I get to play a good person probably again.  Guess who, Jay Webb, he came in late and got a bye, played 2 scrubs, now gets me, and the game wasn’t pretty.<br/>
<br/>
Jay Webb’s Endor Ops (which is the deck I can’t beat) (rating 1580ish)<br/>
My Lost Yoda &amp; Daughter on a deserted planet<br/>
<br/>
Basically here’s the whole game, first turn he gets down Ephant Mon, and Ominous Rumors and Rendili, pretty buff.  I go put down Yoda &amp; Traffic Control, (this is bad, because it means I will get Leia in my hand sooner or later.  He goes and pops down a death squadron star destroyer with merry, weeee bit buff.  I go and end up getting Leia in my hand, because I said I would.  I take 2 drains of 4 and that sucked.  Basically it was our openings that were the game, there wasn’t anything I could do, not like I could beat an Endor deck anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
FL (-22)<br/>
6 (+42)<br/>
<br/>
Goodness:<br/>
None to be mentioned<br/>
<br/>
Sadness:<br/>
The entire game, especially Leia<br/>
<br/>

After the tournament I just got a ride back with Shaner to my dorm, and chilled out for the rest of the night, hoping tomorrow I would do just the same.boy was I wrong.<br/>
