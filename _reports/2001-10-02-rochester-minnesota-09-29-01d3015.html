<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">School was starting to suck again, so I decided to put off my Music History project, dust off my cards and head down to Rochester for a tourney.  After the hour drive, I arrived to be the sixth person, two more people showed a little later and we got underway.  My rating going in was 1733.  For decks, I was playing BoomRace and SYCFA TIEs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Light vs. Brad Gregg (1914) Watto<br/>
<br/>
He started the Watto stuff with IAO/Secret Plans, Mob Points, and Crush.  I started RST, racing, and Strike Planning.  I drew an opening hand with all red cards.  Great.  I grabbed Crix, Solo, and I Did It, before starting the race.  He flashed Anakin and drew something low.  He pulled the Executor and picked up.  I pulled A Step Backward with We Weish to Board at Once, which he grabbed.  I then Signalled for The Shield Is Down, grab the Bunker, pick up and say go.  He drew a 5 and I tried to play A Step backward before draing mine, but he argued that I have to have a destiny and won.  I let it slide even though I was pretty sure I was right and drew two fives.  He did a whole lot of nothing and saved some force.  I dropped Crix, Blount, and Kensaric to Landing Site and grabbed the Back Door and Deactivate, along with a Charge via TMAC, and say go.  He drew something insignificant and I drew a five and something and played A Step Backward.  He finally did something, deploying Watto and P-59 to the Junkyard and also put Merrejyk at the Executor: Dbay and pulled Tatooine.  If I had been thinking I probably would have pulled Cracken and whooped up on Merrejyk, but I wasn’t, so I didn’t.  I then dropped the Bunker, Cracken, a charge, Deactivate, Solo and moved everyone in to the Bunker.  On his turn, I drew a five and a six, winning the race, which I hadn’t expected to do on this turn.  I didn’t have any force saved, so I didn’t retrieve.  He lost his six, while flipping and making me lose two.  On my turn, I blew the bunker, hitting him for eight and dropping his hand.  I got another two on him from the drain and spread to my sites.  He eventually, realizing I had no space, put the Stinger at Fondor and Zuckuss at Tatooine.  I left the Back Door empty for one turn and he dropped Xizor and Vader w/Saber there.  I brought down Obi w/Saber and chopped Xizor, clearing the site.  After that, there wasn’t any interaction.  I got Midge out, draining for five and edging every couple of turns.  He had the three Tatooine sites, Tatooine, and Endor controlled, while Tatooine Occupation did three damage.  When I got under 15 force, Threepio came out and We’re Doomed limited the damage to three each turn.  Eventually my damage got to be too much for him.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+12)<br/>
2(+12)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating a good player.<br/>
Lows: Making some stupid mistakes.  I could have used two force a couple of times instead of losing, stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Dark vs. Peter Jacobson (1672) Mains and Toys<br/>
<br/>
I started Set Your Course with IAO/Secret Plans, There is No Try/Oppressive Enforcement, and You Cannot Hide/Mob Points.  He started Obi’s Hut with Don’t do that Again, Insurrection/Aim High, and Insight/Staging Areas.  Luckily, I drew Wakeelmui and Seinar in my opening hand, along with Sullust.  I dropped all of those and a TIE to Sullust with a gun.  He got Threepio out to the Home One: Dbay and picked up.  I drained and he lost Corran off the top.  That made all the difference.  The Emperor went down to the Death Star: Dbay where Qui-Gon joined him.  A couple turns later, Qui-Gon grabbed his stick, but was never able to hit Palpatine.  The game was pretty boring otherwise.  I set up at Sullust and Endor, and put Keder down when he dropped his characters.  He just couldn’t get any sites out until the end.  I won because of his slow start.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+28)<br/>
4(+40)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning.<br/>
Lows: Beating a good guy because of some bad luck.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Dark vs. Andrew Stenson (1709) WYS<br/>
<br/>
He started Don’t Do that Again and some other random stuff.  I can’t remember anything about this game other than that he inserted Anger, Fear twice and I battled both times.  Once Keder against Jedi Luke, the other a couple of TIEs against the Falcon.  I think I whooped him up in one big battle to essentially end the game, but I could be wrong.  Either way, I won.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+14)<br/>
6(+54)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I don’t remember.<br/>
Lows: Inserts blow.  I spent five minutes looking for a fricking piece of tape to mark one of my sleeves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Light vs. Andrew Stenson (1709) Hunt Down/Racing<br/>
<br/>
He started IAO/Secret Plans, Mob Points/Cannot Hide, and Crush.  First turn, he flashes and draws the Cloud City: Dbay.  He drops the Landing Site and says go.  Nothing happened until after the race was over.  I couldn’t get The Shield is Down, so I wasn’t getting much force.  He couldn’t get any sites, so he wasn’t getting much force.  I won the race after a few turns making him lose 11.  We started fighting over the Bunker, but he couldn’t keep up with the drain at the Back Door.  Lord Vader sat at the Podrace Arena draining for a big one.  Palpatine got chased from the Bunker by Qui-Gon.  I don’t remember how he kept losing force, but cards kept hitting the lost pile.  I killed lots of guys and never even blew the bunker.  Edge helped at the end.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+30)<br/>
8(+84)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning the race and the game.<br/>
Lows: Not blowing the Bunker.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Dark vs. Brad Gregg (1914) WYS racing<br/>
<br/>
He started racing with Squadron Assignments.  First turn, Sebulba flashed and drew a 3.  My destinies were definitely not with me during this game.  I grabbed the non-battleground Coruscant: Dbay and got the Emperor to the DS: Dbay.  He dropped Dash to Kessel, I believe and picked up.  Next turn I drew a five, and he drew something and played A Step Backward to get rid of the five.  It was downhill from there.  I deployed a TIE with gun and killed Dash.  Next turn, he dropped Theron Nett to Tatooine.  I put down another TIE and another gun and battled.  I shot and drew a two.  He played A Few Maneuvers, so I used Fighter Cover to redraw, and drew another two.  So, I fired again using more force and drew a one.  We tied in power thanks to Fighter Cover, but I wasn’t feeling very good.  Next turn he dropped Wedge to Alderaan and I figured he was going to move to the Death Star and I didn’t have enough to stop him, so I barriered Wedge.  He moved Theron to Wakeelmui and said go.  I drained and picked up looking for some back up.  His turn, he played Grimtaash and killed four TIEs and something else.  After that it was pretty much over.  He won the race next turn and buried my TIEs, so I couldn’t retrieve them.  I’m a scrub and forgot that Cannot Hide cancels Numbers, so that hit me for three.  Wedge sat at the DS uncontested and I couldn’t find my spies.  Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
FL (-35)<br/>
8(+49)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Not much.<br/>
Lows: @#$% for destiny.  Getting smacked<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Light vs. Ben Steines (1608) ISB mains<br/>
<br/>
Last time I played Ben, I barely won in a very good game.  He started ISB with the 2/0 Coruscant site, IAO/Secret Plans, Mob Points, and Imperial Decree.  First turn he flashes and draws the Yavin 4: Dbay.  He deploys the Hoth: Dbay from reserve and says go.  I get The Shield is Down and the Bunker and drop Crix, Blount, and Kensaric to the Landing Site.  He goes and draws more bad destiny, a lightsaber, I think.  I draw two high destinies and he ended his turn.  I grabbed Deactivate and dropped the Back Door and Solo with Chewie.  He gets more bad destiny and I get more good ones, so he puts Merrejyk and Palpatine at the Hoth: Dbay.  I drop the Bunker, move everyone in and say go.  His turn, I win the race, without enough to retrieve, as he loses his six.  Next turn, I blew the Bunker retrieving six or so, while he dumped his hand and lost eight.  I also got my drain of two in.  I spread to my two sites, while he set up at the Yavin: Dbay with Maul, TS6 and some random ISB scrub.  He also put Presence at each of the Docking Bays.  He was outdraining me, so I tried to do some damage dropping Obi and Cracken on Palpy and Merrejyk.  Double Agent merrejyk, but I missed the swing and he drew high, so Obi and Cracken died.  I edged once, maybe twice, but We’re Doomed saved me again.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+6)<br/>
10(+55)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning a close game.  We’re Doomed.<br/>
Lows: Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
So I grabbed second to Brad, winning an IAO foil and some packs.  I headed back to school, knowing full well that I had to finish my Music History project.  What can you do?  Now, for the obligatory...<br/>
<br/>
Props:  Brad for winning.<br/>
        Pete for being a cool guy.<br/>
        Stenson, for being my @#$%.<br/>
        Everyone who showed up.<br/>
        Kev for proving just how stupid all those people were who went and filled up there gas tanks on September 11th and 12th, because gas was "supposed to hit four or five dollars a gallon".<br/>
<br/>
Slops:  Dr. hoekstra for assigning this stupid project.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the read.<br/>
