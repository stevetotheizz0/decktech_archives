<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hello this is my first TR. I would go on to explain all about what happened before the tournament but I just did so right now I pretty pissed. My light deck is a Tosche Station mains deck that had 62 cards (whole story later on in the TR) and a SYCFA SD and bounty hunters in their ships deck that I have never used before. The morning of the tournament I get two friends to come with, both I can cream. We arrive at the tournament at about 1050, and we play with a cool Yoda furby thing the TD brought.  The games for game one are announced. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My DS deck vs. Adam The State Champion&amp;#8217;s HB OMDH mains deck.<br/>
<br/>
Well I have never played with the deck I&amp;#8217;m about to use and I&amp;#8217;m playing the state champion, so I figure I&amp;#8217;m about screwed. I put out SYCFA all its crap prepped defenses secret plans, battle order and Mob points. He puts out the Hidden Base crap squad ass. Heading to the boat, insurrection, and something that I forgot. We draw our starting hands, mines okay or at least I thought it was (keep in mind I have never used this deck). I hesitate to pull Carida, so I draw my pile, and get the Carida. He deploys a DB and system from deck and deploys wedge in his ship to tatooine. I activate and attack him with a SD and a guy I think, he looses Wedge and it covers. He builds up on the ground and I build up in the space, and we start draining each other for a few each turn. We have a few battles at DS DB and in space some. And at that time it looks really close, but then he starts doing some OMDH stuff and I kill the ships and guys, so we drain each other, I drop U-3PO, he kills it, and he out drains me and wins by 6.<br/>
FL 0(-6)<br/>
<br/>
Good- I only lost by 6 to the state champ, and I did it with a deck I hadn&amp;#8217;t used before.<br/>
<br/>
Bad- I could have won if I had played a little differently									         							<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My LS vs. Greyson Thompson&amp;#8217;s Raltiir Trooper deck with guns.<br/>
<br/>
We put out our starting stuff. I start Tosche Station and Obi-Wan&amp;#8217;s Hut using careful planning. He puts out Ral Ops, the crap for it prepped defenses entire legion, weapon forfeiter, and Mob Points. We draw our starting hands, mines pretty cool, some mains a c/tv, and some other crap. He pulls some sites and some troopers, while I build up force activation and mains at tosche station. I use the TV to find naburn after he flips, and move all my dudes to a site with a lone trooper squad leader, and battle, I end up grabbing an assault, and making him lose the trooper and 9. I spread out to make his Obj. flip back. Nothing much happens except  I get a DoS at a revoed obis hut for a drain of 4. After a while I win by 29.<br/>
FW 2(+23)<br/>
<br/>
Good- Winning by 29 against a deck I&amp;#8217;ve never played with my current deck.<br/>
<br/>
Bad- None really.<br/>
At this point I&amp;#8217;m feeling really good about my decks, and I think I have a shot at second.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS vs. Henry Jicha&amp;#8217;s Court, massive SAC , vader beat-down deck.<br/>
<br/>
We put out our starting stuff. He puts out court, its crap prepped defenses, power of the hutt, mob points, and No Bargain, (see game 2 for my starting). He gets out some effects loses a card to court. I start dropping mains at the pit ( I don&amp;#8217;t know what to expect), he drops some aliens to the audience chamber, and pull some DBs and a Mob Points system. He gets sail barge at the tosche station. We drain each other for one for a while, then he drops vader, and tarkin and kills Obi in a duel, and beats down on my other people. I try to get some more mains down but its no use, I get Harc and stop some of his drains, but he cancels anything I try to do, so he ends up winning by 23.<br/>
FL 2(0)<br/>
<br/>
Good- Henry won or lost every game (when this was played) by 23, I think that&amp;#8217;s pretty cool<br/>
<br/>
Bad- Losing by 23. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My DS vs. Henry&amp;#8217;s (again) Hidden Mains with big SAC<br/>
<br/>
He starts Hidden Base crap, heading for the boat, squad ass, Insurrection, and YISYW, I think (for my start, see game 1). I get some guys out in space and drain him the whole game. He pulls some dbs, gets massive activation, and builds up some ground force. All this time I have palpy, miyoom, and vader sitting at the ds db. I miyoom him once for 2. He attacks the crew and drops OTE, that gets me for about 6 the whole game. I pretty much out drain him in space. <br/>
FW 4(+13) <br/>
<br/>
Good- I won the game, tournament is finally over.<br/>
<br/>
Bad- I broke Henry&amp;#8217;s 23 record.<br/>
<br/>
I take 3rd in the tourney overall.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now for the story I promised from the beginning. After the last game I saw Henry counting his decks to see if anyone had any of his cards. I decided to look though mine too. So I check my DS, its fine, then I look at my light, and it has 62 cards, I count it  over and over like 10 times until I realize that it is 62 cards. Sense I&amp;#8217;m honest I tell the TD about it, he says its alright but not to do it again. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Lowell&amp;#8217;s parents for driving and to Don for running the tournament and for letting me get away with a 62 card deck.<br/>
