there’s this con in normal il.  it’s really just a mini-con, but the thing is that they are having both swccg and 40k tournaments.  so since my younger brother plays 40k i figure’d we’d both go and have a good time.  the information on the con website says that they’re expecting 50-70 people for the star wars event.  <br/>
<br/>
lol<br/>
<br/>
i get there early cuz my brothers rogue trader tournament starts at 9.  the starwars doesnt start till 10, so i just hang out and look around at all the goofy con crap that is just plain crap.  after my bro starts his first game, i wander over to the other building where the sw is to be played.  much to my shagrine, there is no one there.  so i just walk up and down the hallway for a few minutes and then i hear someone yell WHAT???  and of course, it’s eric olson.  it turns out that olson (2 time IL state champ), ron fonck (the td), and frank (one of corellia’s finest) all drove together to come to flatcon.  not flat, just level.  it’s about five to ten and we have 3 people for the tourny.  great.  Aaron Komar and two other guys that i havent seen before show up and we are 1 person short of a sanctioned tourny.  hmmm.  at this point, we’ve all paid about 20 bucks for the con, drove a lot, and are generally pissed off at one geoff snider.  but ron thinks he posted the tourny for 12 on the web page so we wait around and talk about crap for an hour and a half.  at 11:30 frank calls geoff at cyberia, cuz no one is showing up and we all want product.  i dunno what snider said on the phone but he got us a box of coruscant, which i guess is okay.  at noon, nobody else has shown up yet so we just start playin a f’ing unsanctioned tourny.<br/>

unsanctioned game #1<br/>
<br/>
my senate lott dodd crap -vs- eric olson’s rtp that somehow wins<br/>
<br/>
it’s a good thing this game was unsanctioned, i played like crap.  i start my usual crap and figure i should have no problem beating rtp.  my opening hand has lott dodd, another senator, and a db.  now i had just made some changes to the deck the night before and i couldn’t remember if i still had 3 db’s in my deck.  so i go and look for one and of course it’s not there.  olson gets to look through my deck and see’s that i’m planning on pulling off a mid game podrace.  therefore, olson doesn’t lose any podracing cards the whole game.  i flip my objective, get the honor killing senator out, and put a prescence on the senate chamber.  olson get’s 8d8 over to leia, misses twice, but free’s her the third time and retrieves force.  i top deck chybc, but i get it back next turn with no escape.  chybc saves my butt, and keeps olson’s retrieval to a minimum, like a death star plans for 5.  during the course of the game, maul gets placed out of play, and so does p-59.  ig-88’s one chance to capture leia missed and he got placed out of play too.  lott dodd had finally pulled all the podrace elements out of my force pile and i throw it all down for some good ole boonta eve action.  olson saved his racer and all his interrupts so he was able to race too.  i forget to flame anakin, so sebulba draws a two, and anakin draws a two and a three.  olson puts the 3 back in his deck.  the rest of the podace goes like this;  anakin 5,5,5,5,6,4;  sebulba 2,2,5.  so anakin pops the box and i have exactly 11 cards left to lose.  <br/>
<br/>
YAY SEBULBA!<br/>
<br/>
result:  FL by 13<br/>
<br/>
hi’s:  it was an unsanctioned game.<br/>
lo’s:  playin like crap at crap con.<br/>
<br/>
oh yeah, the con had this gay thing goin on where if you lost a game you got a sticker that said " i died at flatcon"  and the person with the most stickers at the end of the weekend won some big loser trophy.  thanks to olson i got one of these "fun" stickers.<br/>
<br/>
unsanctioned game #2<br/>
<br/>
I GOT THE BYE!<br/>
<br/>
so i walk around the con for a while cuz there’s supposed to be some chain mail chick that looks pretty hot, but she’s not around so i go see how my brother is doin and it looks like he’s having an okay time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
unsanctioned game #3<br/>
<br/>
my wys -vs- i have no idea’s senate that does nothing.<br/>
<br/>
this game was pretty sad.  we were both only activating like 9 force a turn.  i got some ships to kessel early and was draining for 3.  he got his senate goin and put some guys on tatooine.  battle order was keeping him from draining almost the whole game, and he never moved anyone into the cantina.  so all i did the whole time was drain for 3 at kessel and setup my hand for the trippler.   once i got mirax and threepio out it only took me 2 turns and i had everything i needed.  i didn’t even flip till the last turn.  the trippler went like this.  deploy beggar, use his force to deploy han in front of choke vader with stick and tarkin, deploy luke to an adjacent site, battle with han and the trippler, run luke run, swing at vader, with destiny’s setup by mirax and threepio, hit, make him lost with satm combo, han shoots tarkin, destiny is 5 and 1, thats tarkin and 33 more.  game.<br/>
<br/>
result:  FW by 23.<br/>
<br/>
hi’s:  pulling off the trippler.<br/>
lo’s:  it was a pretty non interactive game, he neve came into space to satisfy battle plan, so he just sat there and pretty much did nothing.<br/>
<br/>
THE BEER GAME<br/>
<br/>
the beer game is possibly the most fun card game i have ever played.  basically you have 2-4 players, there are 2 decks of i dont know how many cards.  one deck is the beer deck, the other is the action deck.  the beer deck contains beer cards, game cards (like pool and darts), and special cards called "it’s getting late"  and "last call".   the action deck has cards that you get in your hand, the actions do things like make players buy a round of beer’s, make a player discard half his beer’s, or you may buy 3 beer’s this turn but skip your next turn, or cancel another players coin flip for pool or darts.  each beer cost’s 2 beer bucks, you start with 20 beer bucks, the player with the most beer’s at last call wins.  so we start playin this game and it’s a f’ing riot.  seriously you have to play it to see just how fun it is.  the last turn came down to this, the guy on my right had the most beers, but there was one beer left and he couldn’t buy it, olson and i were tied for second, but ron had skipped my turn with some weird card, and olson would be up next to buy the last beer and win, so the guy on my right plays this other gay card that will skip olsons turn and thus win him the game.  but olson plays the size matters card which makes the guy lose half his beers, AWESOME.  this means that olson and i are now tied for first, but i had more beer bucks left so i win!  <br/>
<br/>
hi’s:  2x chug-a-lug is broken<br/>
lo’s:  none really, this game is hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
unsanctioned game #4<br/>
<br/>
my senate -vs-  the same guy’s ls senate jedi counce and jedi<br/>
<br/>
maul sucks.  i figured it would be a good idea to get maul into the jedi council chamber cuz a drain of four would be pretty good.  i got maul and saber in my opening hand, but it took me 3 turns to save up enough force to put him in play.  but he beat all the jedi there by a turn.  next turn yoda and depa billaba go to defend the jc.  he doesnt battle, so i battle him on my turn, miss depa, draw a 1 and lose 2 to the battle.  this went on for 4 F’ING turns.  then mace and p_nis head show up and maul has to leave.  i was able to take over the senate chamber, and maul went to tatooine where he belongs.  but the jedi just cant leave maul alone and obi and luke show up.  once again mauls bad destiny’s cost me a lot of force.  after a while though i was able to setup a few destiny’s  and duel obi and battle luke off.  i tried to pull off another podrace but the guy drew up before i could finish.<br/>
<br/>
result:  FW by 8???<br/>
<br/>
hi’s:  taking the senate by force <br/>
lo’s:  maul had his head up his a$$ for most of the game.<br/>
<br/>
well, that’s it for star wars.  frank won the tourny cuz olson managed to lose a game.  we all split the box of coruscant and nobody got anything good.<br/>
it was only 5 o’clock and everybody took off to go kill snider, but wait! i cant leave cuz my brother is gonna be playing 40k for another 4 hours.  so i go get something to eat and look around for the chain mail girl again, but she was hiding in the garbage, or she got fallen portal’d, or set for stun’d, or something.  then i found some guys playing a game called starfleet battles so i sat down and learned how to play that, and it was pretty fun.<br/>
<br/>
finally the 40k thing is done at about 9:30 and my bro and i take off for home.  <br/>
<br/>
