<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">If you read my Day 1 Report and many of the others posted, then you would have known<br/>
that that tournament ended around 3:30 AM. I wasn’t to happy with my light side deck so<br/>
for some reason I was determined to change it.  So at 4:00 in the Morning I make a new<br/>
Light Side Deck.  I get about 3 hours sleep, and then get up test my new deck once, and<br/>
wake up Matt to make sure he makes it, and get down to start playing in the Real Worlds,<br/>
which was called Day 2 this year.<br/>
<br/>
Since this was important to me I do remember the games a little better than I remember<br/>
the ones from Day 1, but still there might be things I forget.  My DS is the same BHBM<br/>
deck with about 3 card changes, and my new Light Side Built just hours before was a<br/>
Profit Deck.  When I go back to think about it I probably would have done better with my<br/>
old light, but don’t we all say that.  I had really intense games, and at times I did what I<br/>
had to do to scrape up a win.  I thought My dif was low the day before, this tourney it was<br/>
even lower.  After talking with John Arendt we realize how many from Tatooine made it,<br/>
and it was 6 players, 7 if you count Jeremy Lamere(honorary Tatooine player), that was a<br/>
little to be proud of.  Anyway on to the games:<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS vs John Arendt’s Huntdown with Duel Rating 2120<br/>
<br/>
Me and John are at a lot of big tournaments, but only now we face each other, in fact we<br/>
played on table one.  He started with Control early on when he Altar Honor of the Jedi<br/>
which went to my used pile, and I believe I never got it out again. Also after tracking<br/>
destiny he turned Jedi Luke to the dark side, which hurt a bit, but I did free Han to get 10<br/>
force back, which I was able to keep the game close.  I did get a spy to cancel Visage, and<br/>
when I drain over there, he Counter Assaulted I lose force.  He did get coward out, but I<br/>
had 2 battlegrounds so I can drain, but this time I grimtaash first to see if he had another<br/>
Counter Assault, and that net me 2 Altar which I didn’t complain about and he had no<br/>
Counter Assault, so I drained.  He was trying to find Circle so he can get Ben off the<br/>
table, but that card avoided him to my relief.  I mainly lost when Dark Jedi Luke used I<br/>
have you Now against Leia his own sister, plus a few drains in space and that was it. <br/>
Good Game.<br/>
Full Loss by 8<br/>
Total: 0(-8)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Keeping it close after I thought it was going to be bad.<br/>
Lowlights: Having my Jedi Luke turned....<br/>
<br/>
I check to see how other Players are doing and it turns out Matt lose his first one as well,<br/>
with the other Tat players doing ok I believe.  Losing my first game is not something I<br/>
wanted to do, but it happened.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS vs Josh Martin’s Hidden Base Rating 1972<br/>
<br/>
Wow I have to play another Tatooine Player.  Well when I saw his objective I knew my<br/>
dark can beat it, but Josh is a good player so he might be able to pull it off.  Basically he<br/>
deploys early, and I take advantage of it with beatdown, I had SAC in my hand so I wasn’t<br/>
worry about his Barrier, which wasn’t in his had anyway.  I win a battle, and he loses<br/>
force, plus stacks a card.  I soon capture Luke and he soon loses 3 more battles, so there<br/>
is 4 cards stacks, and I set up a losing duel, but I am not sure about just what card is under<br/>
that, I lose the duel of course, but I only draw a 3 and I needed a 4 or more.  So I have I<br/>
more turn of drains to take and my objective damage.  Next turn I lose duel, and draw the<br/>
number I need to turn Luke to the Dark side, making Josh lose all force, I just like winning<br/>
like that.<br/>
Full Win by 17<br/>
Total: 2(+9)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Winning a guess, it was a really fun game.<br/>
Lowlights: Not losing force to my own Objective for about 3 turns, sorry Josh.<br/>
<br/>
Ok now I am 1-1 lets see if I can keep it up.  The funny thing is the next person I have to<br/>
play is Jeremy Lamere, so now I thinking is this worlds? Or is this the Tatooine Regional<br/>
since the first 3 people I play are from Tatooine.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS vs Jeremy Lamere’s Hidden Base Rating 1927<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that Jeremy and Josh were playing the same deck, almost card for card, so I<br/>
did know what to expect, and I played to make sure I had the up hand, but Jeremy did<br/>
keep it close.  Just winning a few battles here and there, is what did it for me however, and<br/>
taking advantage of all my stuff.  I win.<br/>
Full Win by 13<br/>
Total 4(+22)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Well since I did know what to expect that helped.<br/>
Lowlights: Not really a Lowlight, but kind of weird to play 3 Tatooine players in a row.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LS vs Bruce Savin’s BHBM Rating 1728<br/>
<br/>
This game was important to me because since I built this deck earlier this morning I still<br/>
didn’t know if it was capable to win.  It start off by him being very cautious, which was<br/>
good really, I had Jedi Luke, Ben, and Gift in my hand, and was dying to use it.  Soon I<br/>
draw Weapon Levitate, and thought this is a good time.  I use Frozen Assets first, then<br/>
Drop Ben, Luke, and Ben Saber, and battle Mara, Emperor, and a Walker.  I Weapon lev,<br/>
Mara, and slice her, and play gift to clear the site.  Soon after I free Han, and he sets up a<br/>
drain of 2 in Space and another on the ground.  I am doing profit damage, and tracking a<br/>
It could be worse for one of his drains.  Soon he grabs that, so we play some technical<br/>
game until I win.<br/>
Full Win by 16<br/>
Total: 6(+38)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: My Ls won so it could be that bad, it might be able to hold it off today.<br/>
Lowlights: None really I did what I wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
Well I am 3-1 now.  That is what I wanted at the half way point to be at least 3-1.  Maybe<br/>
my next 4 games I can go 3-1 to pull out a good finish.  Well lets see.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My LS vs Martin Akesson’s BHBM Rating 1916<br/>
<br/>
At this time I am up to like 5th or 6th place, which is kind of cool.  I am feeling a little<br/>
good, since this deck just beat BHBM, but he is a good player so lets up see.  First things<br/>
start to look good, and Martin plays light a champ.  I decide to give him Luke very early<br/>
so he would have to lose force every turn.  I block drains with Boushh, and it starts slow. <br/>
He soon sets up a drain of 2 in space with me looking for cool stuff in my deck.  I counted<br/>
his deck and counted mine, and realized I could win, if I just play it right.  Well this is<br/>
when IG-88 comes down in front of Han and Chewie, why did I not put someone else<br/>
there? and Battle, I try Fallen Portal he senses, I altar, and he Sense anyway, I then try<br/>
Narrow Escape, and he has one more sense, which does my in.  That did it for me when he<br/>
captured Han.  I did have a Sorry about the mess in hand, but he move IG over to the<br/>
DSII docking and I could get Ben with saber over from where he was at.  Good game.<br/>
Full Loss by 11<br/>
Total: 6(+27)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Ahh...something it was a good game<br/>
Lowlights: not leaving someone else with Han and Chewie so I could draw battle destiny.<br/>
<br/>
I can’t lose anymore from here on out it I will have a chance, or so I think.  Matt has<br/>
decided to play one more game before he drops, because he is having some tough match<br/>
ups.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My DS vs Hayes Hunter Throne Room Steam Roller Rating 2064<br/>
<br/>
Right at the start I had a bad draw.  At the same time he has a god draw, first turn he<br/>
drops 2 twix locations, and draws.  Next turn he drops 3 more twix location and draws.  I<br/>
knew it was going to be bad for me, but I wanted just play my game and maybe things will<br/>
work out.  Of course it didn’t he was activating way more force than I was and he had<br/>
total control and with Goo Nee Tay out he had Force advantage.  The bad part is when he<br/>
OOC my Vader in my lost pile and that was it for me.<br/>
Full Loss by 24<br/>
Total: 6(+3)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Well I did get to play Hayes, and he is so funny and he made my loss a fun<br/>
game even though I got crushed.<br/>
Lowlights: I lost by way to much not there is not a chance.  <br/>
<br/>
Well I am 3-3 and now I just want to win my last two games to have a respectable finish<br/>
and a decent placing.<br/>
<br/>
Game 7: My LS vs Alex Klammrodt’s Dark side Beatdown Rating 1937<br/>
<br/>
It was nice to meet Alex he is Avatar here on Deck tech for those who don’t know, and he<br/>
had a interesting deck.  I thought he had this game when I had Ben and Jedi Luke with<br/>
Saber in the Audience Chamber.  You would think that was enough to hold whatever beat<br/>
down he had coming.  Boy was I wrong.  He has Mara, Vader, Ig-88, 4-Lom, Jabba, Epp<br/>
Fett, all deployed in Chamber, and battles, he plays I have you Now, and slices Luke, and<br/>
cancels Ben text.  He drew really good, and this is like only the 4 turn in the game, I<br/>
couldn’t believe it.  I lose both Ben and Jedi Luke and like another 13 cards, or was it 23? <br/>
It was a lot.  I am think I lost at this point, but soon I find my evasive cards, he had<br/>
already grab, my Grimtaash, my Altar, and my Fallen Portal, so since I have only one It<br/>
could be worse, I used it to save my life.  With 2 Undercover’s blocking drains, and It<br/>
could be worse for the space drain, and now I finally drew Someone who Loves you, I<br/>
free Han.  I just make sure Narrow Escape, and Rebel Barrier work like crazy to pull out a<br/>
win out of my @ss.<br/>
Full Win by 8<br/>
Total 8(+11)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Coming back from such a losing battle.<br/>
Lowlights: Thinking Ben and Jedi Luke can hold there own...sometimes no :)<br/>
<br/>
Ok the last game is upon us.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8: My DS vs John Arendt’s Hidden Base Flip Rating 2120<br/>
<br/>
Well we get to play again it turns out.  Maybe I will get my revenge.  Which I did, but he<br/>
kept it close.  It was about even for a while until he flip.  I soon deployed two ships to<br/>
probe at two different places.  I got it at Kessel right away which helped out my cause. <br/>
He had a fleet at Kessel so I moved away, and let him have that Drain of 3.  He did deploy<br/>
Ben and Orri to one of my docking bays and realized he didn’t have enough force to move<br/>
to the Endor one, I took advantage of that by deploying Ig-88 and Mara with Saber and<br/>
some other beat down.  I capture Orri and slice Obi and win he stacks a card and loses like<br/>
12 cards.  That helped my cause.  It was just a moving around game from there.  I pretty<br/>
much let him have the drain of 3 at Kessel, because I was afraid of Legendary Starfighter<br/>
and he played well to keep my win very low.<br/>
Full Win by 4<br/>
Total 10(+15)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Well I did go 5-3 which is good in Worlds.<br/>
Lowlights: Player John again was kind of weird, I wish I won by a lot more, but I didn’t<br/>
have a chance anyway.  Fun game<br/>
<br/>
It was over, and I wait to see where I placed.  I ended up coming in 19th place overall<br/>
which is not to shabby if I say so myself.  Congrats to all who made it to Day 3, and Sokol<br/>
you rock for winning it all.<br/>
