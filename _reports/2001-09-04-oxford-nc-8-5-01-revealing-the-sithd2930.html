<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ya, hello, and welcome to another episode of the greatest saga ever : SWCCG tournaments. Ok, jk. :) <br/>
<br/>
I’ll try to keep the pretourny stuff to a minimum, but hey, thats the juicy stuff :) OK. I moved to NC to start school again about 3 1/2 weeks ago. I was feelin kinda lonely, as I didn’t know anybody, so I was really lookin forward to the upcoming tourny in oxford, for a box. After talking to paul myers online and signing over my soul, he hooked me up with a LS deck that romps everything, on the condition that I not reveal the deck to anybody except those I played, or where it came from, and especially not to post it. At least, not til after dragon con. So now that dragon con is over, whatever, I like shareing cool stuff like i like women; in other words A LOT.<br/>
<br/>
Basically it was the most f’d up profit I’d ever seen. I’d thought a while back about doing a profit numbers deck, but it just seemed unreasonably weak versus some decks (I was gonna put 8d8, artoo, and jedi luke at the H1 docking bay...but then the deck couldn’t fight and playing battling charachters in multiple tends to kill odds.) So guess what! this was a profit racing deck, using AFAs and numbers, and like 45673905706790756209 anti battle/ damage cards. It worked like a charm, prvided the opponent didn’t know what was coming. I loved it instantly :)<br/>
<br/>
For darkside, I needed a high differential deck, so I went with a solid Hunt down, but one that used podracing too.that might have been a mistake, but somebody up there likes me apparently, cause 2 games I mighta lost with it I won, and only by either technicallity or bad luck on the opponents side....<br/>
<br/>
Ok so that friday (tourny on sturday) Caleb Foth came up from greenville sc, to play in the tourny and just hang out<br/>
so we make and work on decks, I make the profit, and he plays with my hidden base. I try to give him some pointers, but caleb is one of those guys that know what all the cards do but not necessarily how to play them, so thinks I am telling him what they do and says he knows. whatever, its kinda funny. He plays the HB deck WAY to aggressivly, doesn’t wait for the opponent to drop their characters elsewhere before dropping teh forest and stuff like that. Its cool, he’s happy. We make these cool T-shirts we’d been takling about. Basically, I made up this company called ScrubWear 2001. All the shirts say (on the front) "All Your ____ Are Belong To Us". The _____ is filled by whatever term you want. Example, my shirt says "All Your Deck Are Belong To Us." Caleb’s was "Scrub". ANYWAY, the back has a number on it (your number in the team) and can have whatever you want on it. Mine has a smiley face and says "have a nice day." (its awesome cause thats te side the opponent sees when yuo are walking away to give them your score card) hehe just kiddin. :)<br/>
<br/>
So we head out, following the directions, get lost twice, stop at Burger King. I dominate THEIR 99cent menu (yeah, eric, yuo can have wendys. I got da king baby) ok, enough o’ dat, we get grub, and find this store. THIS PLACE ROCKS. Some kids are playing some decks and I casually walk over and talk to them, notice that one is playing SYCFA flip, a deck I know inside and out, having built (i think) the best version of it. I might be wrong, but haven’t seen a better one yet, so whatever. The kid is doing it all wrong, but I don’t say too much, just that he might like to use A Million Voices. He’s a good guy, and I’m just happy to see a non cheese deck seeing play.<br/>
<br/>
Adam Weinstein shows up, I realize I met him last year at Heroes Con (he tried to get the t-shirt I won off me) and he’s like the coolest SW person I’ve ever met. We chat a bit, I meet his dad (don weinstein is awesome too...he’s also my padawan learner so I totally like love this family thus far). OK. N E Way. The TD gets down to it, and we’re off!<br/>
<br/>
Me (DS) Huntdown Racer solid<br/>
Me (LS) Profit Racer cheeseball<br/>
Caleb (DS) Senate manipulator<br/>
Caleb (LS) HB Flip control solid/ ten numb superstar<br/>
<br/>
my rating is 1779 (not including 4-0)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1::::<br/>
<br/>
My LS vs. Lee Taft (1364) Senate<br/>
<br/>
this game isn’t fair. This is lees 2nd tourny ever, so I don’t insert on him early (I feel REALLY bad just beating the heck outta someone just getting into the game, especially when so many others are quiting) He does some senate stuff, I tell him about what some of the cards do, tho I commend him for doing a good job and knowing his cards. I win the race, pop inserts, free han, avoid battle, and win the game by 34.<br/>
<br/>
HIGHS: meeting a new player, figuring out how to play this deck.<br/>
LOWS: having to make sure I had good differential and having to insert.<br/>
<br/>
2(+34)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2::::<br/>
<br/>
My DS vs. Alex Devito (1553) QMC/Secure Route<br/>
<br/>
Well, he starts downtown plaza and bespin, plus usual stuff (squass, etc) and I start the race. I get 3 from him so I activate 8 first turn :) stack a 5 on the racer, then deploy Lord Vader + GOOD stick (never leave home without it) to his DTPlaza and pull Flagship bridge. I flip, and he loses one to visage. his turn he just plays the DB, draws and loses 1. My turn I drain 3, stack a 4, play (cor) Maul + stick and evazan combo to the DB. He loses to visage. His turn, he deploys another site and draws, losing one. My turn, drain and stack a 6, draw. His turn, kill vader with the ’uber beatdown’ tho I could have kept vader and lost like 7. He loses a bunch and vader covers. I lose one to visage. My turn, drop EPP vader to plaza, emperor + mara jade + stick to other site, move evazan over, win race, retrieve like 5 and he loses 11. shortly after that the game ended. FW (30)<br/>
<br/>
HIGHS: absolutely owning a deck I thought would be a tough matchup.<br/>
LOWS:beating another low ranked player.<br/>
<br/>
4(+64)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3 ::::<br/>
<br/>
My LS versus Caleb Foth (1647) senate manipulator. <br/>
<br/>
CALEB GETS BACK ON MY COOL SIDE definately forever with the class act he did here. Even tho he knew what I was playing hedecided to play as if he didn’t. So he doesn’t start the numbers killer. I follow his lead and don’t start Honor. We play enough and are good enough friends that the game doesn’t matter except for purposes of being the game. Anyway, I pull my droids early with seeking an audience . the turn before I get ready to insert numbers, caleb plays teh numbers killer. O well. I beat up on him, he on me, then retrieve 20 lategame dispite CHYBC and secret plans.<br/>
FW(31)<br/>
<br/>
HIGHS: My deck not having to rely on numbers to win.<br/>
LOWS: playin my bud<br/>
<br/>
6(+95)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4 ::::<br/>
<br/>
My DS versus Adam Weinstein (1822) TIGIH my deck.<br/>
<br/>
I finally get to play someone who has some points to give up :) basically his deck is my deck, except that he uses TIGIH as a base (so huntdown is hurt) and uses maintenance droids, not artoo and naked 3po. oh, and his deck is a choke deck. GREAT. I activate 6 first turn, flash him draw like a 4 or 5, play Dark Path, leave some draw some. He moves luke over and plays some droids, inserts. so now I can’t use dark path with an insert in the deck. I draw pretty high and so does he. I play vader to the DB, capture luke, and flip both objs. so now he’s losing 1 a turn to visage. His tun play some stuff, pass. Basically the game goes on this way for a while. He tries the beatdown with obi, who I duel, and then he trys to On The Edge after the duel is over to cancel the duel. I am dead sure it doesn’t work that way, but the TD rules with him, so I am denied of 9 differential and a very toasty obi. He then draws two 1’s for race destiny and a 2 at a bad place to do so. I dark path a 6, so I win the race, and the game. I drain him out a few turns later. FW (23)<br/>
<br/>
HIGHS: playing and beating adam. And meeting him too.<br/>
LOWS: Bad ruling, and narrowly winning the race.<br/>
<br/>
8(+118)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 ::::<br/>
<br/>
My DS versus Henry Jicha (1767) MWYHL racing<br/>
<br/>
So his deck is designed just to beat me. So this is probably the deciding game. So what? We each play a good game. I wonder about a few of the moves he tried to do. Henry strikes me as a very good player, and there were a couple of things (like play podrace prep and then draw) or I should say TRIED TO DO that cost him the game. One problem a lot of players have when they are good, and I am not saying this is the case of henry by anymeans, is that they will conveniently forget rulings if its in thier favor to forget them. So I tell him he can’t do that (after he draws destiny BESIDES the podrace prep.) and he’s like can I take that back (now we both know there’s a 6 on top. if he gets anything other than the 6 he wins, but if its just the 6 we tie, and I win. So I’m like, sotty dude, but his is for a box, so NO you can’t take back the action. Sorry. And he’s cool with it so I don’t feel to bad about it. Henry’s deck was teh perfect counter to mine, so I only pull out a win by 9 after duling (again) obi succesfully :)<br/>
(FW 9)<br/>
<br/>
HIGHS:henruy being cool about making making a mistake and me having to be a @#$%.<br/>
Lows: henry should have won that game. If not for the podrace prep, he would have. must destroy darkside deck after tourny.<br/>
<br/>
10(+127)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 6 ::::<br/>
<br/>
My LS(yeah!) versus Mike "Oqrygg" Merletto (1805) ROPs/shaft<br/>
<br/>
Basically I play droids and inserts, then lost in hte wilderness his atst pilot. I play jedi luke, numbers pops, he loses like 14. He shafts luke then puts ozzel in front. I play OTE and make artoo undercover at the AC, then lose 4.<br/>
His turn AFA pops, so he’s gotta attack luke. He deploys mara, then gets her saber. Then I play double agent and kill her. He then plays vader and he gets barriered. so he loses 7 and moves ozzel away. My turn, lose 4 after inserting again, and move over in front of ozzel. his turn I could have won the race before, but waited due to secret plans. I win this turn, and he loses 3 to moves vader in front of luke. My turn I play Lando w/ axe to retrieve 10 then 4 more with I did it. drain/ damage him out the next turn.FW(25)<br/>
<br/>
HIGHS:meeting mike. he’s awesome. LITW his atst pilot guy. everything. epp obi + resilience for OWNING.<br/>
Lows: Shaft? naw, I got around that :)<br/>
<br/>
12(+152)<br/>
<br/>
HOLY CRAP!!! this is like the best 4 me EVER ata ny tournament. I get a box and a foil sense. I then sell half the box for $2 a pack, then open te rest and get an AI yoda and and AI mace. Super phat.<br/>
