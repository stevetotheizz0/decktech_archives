<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">  Tim Guzman here from Mos Vegas, Tatooine.  I wasn't planning on writing a report, but here I am it's late and I just want to.  I was looking forward to this tournament, because it was over a month since I played in one.  I was glad to see a good turn out of 19 players.  If you click on my name you will see the Light Deck I played. Basically I played a Profit Deck I call P&amp;L(Profit and Loss), very fun and really strong.  Of course that went undefeated in this tourney.  On the Dark side I played Ralltiir Operations, using chicken walkers and well you know the basic package.<br/>
<br/>
On to the games:<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My DS vs Danny Rider's Profit Deck.<br/>
<br/>
We have practice on Thursday nights and Danny was there with this cool Profit deck.  He beat me in practice, but for some reason he change his deck, before the tourney.  I started IOA because well I just have to and he starts Wise Advice, which is really the good thing he did this game.  I choose not to put any aliens down hoping he would rescue han soon, so I can kill him.  He did what I was hoping so after a easy flip I was able to do what I wanted to han.  I went to go get Sniper and he was finished with the first han.  Then I trample another Han, but wait he had one more.  That one stayed for the rest of the game, but it was not enough for him since he wasn't really draining for anything. And toward the end I put down AAA and did him in.  I win by 17<br/>
2(+17)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:I beat a good deck, if he was a better player it would have been a tough win.<br/>
Lowlights:I was hoping to play a tougher player<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my LS vs JT Marty's Yavin Occupation with Numbers.<br/>
<br/>
First turn he drops 2 Biker scout with bikes and insert.  I am a little upset, but I see nothing but beatdown coming for him.  I deploy Mowman Undercover to help ease the loss that is soon to come.  His next turn he just draws some cards.  Well this is great I activate and up come the insert I lose only 3 force.  I deploy Leia with Anaikin's Saber and her Blaster rifle, I beat down one of the biker's, I do not know why he did not react the other one over, maybe because I would make that one lost during battle.  Anyway he losing a lot from that, and now drops two more Biker scouts and Epp Vader and battles.  I think to myself this is to easy.  I clash Vader shoot one trooper with her gun, that ones lost use and draw a 5 for destiny.  He lose yet more cards.  I decide I would at least lose some more force until there was 10 cards in lost pile, then I get those back when I flip.  This game was a little to easy.  Full win by 30<br/>
4(+47)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:The deck did good against Numbers<br/>
Lowlights: I wanted to play someone tougher<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS Vs Brandon Gravo Hunt Down<br/>
<br/>
Well he knew my deck for the most part, just not a few of the changes.  For some reason I remember a little about what happen.  I lost a few from Visage and when I thought that was enough I rescued Han and retrieved 10 of those cards back.  Then I deployed a Bothan Spy and Orr to cancel Visage.  I wasn't worried about them because I had a Narrow Escape in my hand, which he grabs after a certain battle.  I do remember one battle that cost him a lot of force and pretty much was the game winner, that and having to lose force for my mains spread out.  Full Win by 20something I think 29<br/>
6(+76)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:His Huntdown was good going undefeated in the previous Tournament so it was good to beat that.<br/>
Lowlights:None I had fun.  Brandon is going to get tougher and tougher as time goes on.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 MY DS Vs Kris Lavignes Lightside OPS with Mains.<br/>
<br/>
Well most of us know that Ralltiir Ops is strong against everything, but when playing Ops it gets a little tricky.  For some reason I have an ugly draw.  I had all my ships in my hand.  I don't like this because it slows down my flip.  Anyway I started Battle Plan which slow him down for awhile.  I was looking for cards to flip mine and battle him at the same time.  It was close most of the game.  Now I was going to set up Bright Center on his planet to completely shut him down and hence probably win the game.  It was his turn, he only has a drain of 2, I lose one out of my hand and one from the top of the Reserve. Well you guessed it, it was Bright Center.  Now that that plan didn't work I did what I could do to make him lose force. He had a Tantive that just would die with boosted forfeit Characters abroad and coming abroad everyturn.  I came up a little short. Full Loss by 7<br/>
6(+69)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:I played a tough opponent.<br/>
Lowlights:I played against Ops, that gets a little boring.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 my DS Vs Noah Singers Profit Decks.<br/>
<br/>
Well he starts saying that I am the third person today who played Ralltiir and how he ripped the decks apart with 30 or more victory.  I go oh really.  Anyway I have a god draw, if only I had this draw in the previous game.  I flip very soon, he tries to go battle on my planet I react all chicken walkers over and he put cards in the lost pile.  I battle him in space after some time goes by and Deploy AAA which eventually he can't keep up with.  I have a lot of cards on the table so... Full Win by 13<br/>
8(+82)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:Helping Noah come back down to earth<br/>
Lowlights:None<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 My LS Vs Noah Singers Court Deck<br/>
<br/>
Well I have to play Noah again.  He is playing Court and the two aliens he gets out for free are Ephant Mon and Jabba.  Well this is going to slow me down a little.  I will need to kill Ephant Mon soon.  But he keeps backing up the Audience Chamber with Character after Character.  So I set up at the Farm and JP: Palace and wait for him to come out in the open.  He does with lots of characters, including Ephant Mon.  My turn I deploy Order to Engage, OH and before that I played Sorry About the Mess on Ephant Mon.  So when he was dead I deploy Leia and broke her cover.  I let him battle me at the Palace and Played Fallen Portal, Clash of Sabers, Courage on Luke, Double Agent on Mara, and Skywalkers.  When the dust cleared he only had Jabba left standing and I had everyone there because of Ben.  I move everyone over and free Han.  He even Trap Doored Leia to the Rancor Pit and retrieved some force from that, but it wasn't enough I Made Ordered to Engage him again.  Sometimes its best just to loose the 3 force, but no he battles again, I Gift and Clash and he loss's the game.  Full Win by 33<br/>
10(+115)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:It is so much fun to play a lot of interrupts.<br/>
Lowlights:Didn't I just play this guy?<br/>
<br/>
Well I came in second with a 5-1 Record.  I think my rating of 2002 will be going down, even with a 5-1 because of who I played, but oh well that seems to happen sometimes.  Kris Lavigne came in first going undefeated.<br/>
