<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Man it’s a been awhile since I’ve written one of these. I wanted to win this tourney, I mean I WANTED to win! Why? Because I know that I’m good enough to win. I know that I’m good enough to just dominate the local scene here for at least ONE tourney. So far, I have not done that. (Still, I can’t remember the last time I didn’t place in the top 5). I’m not trying to be arrogant, but y’know, you work hard at something and you want to get the best results possible, so I wanted to win. In preparation, I built like 3 LS decks and they all sucked it up big time, so I was at a lost come Friday. Then, I see this WYS deck that won some tourney in Germany (not beatdown) built by Julien Riveria’ (Spelling?). It has like 21 characters and the interrupts are basically all for battling. My kind of deck. I build it, and feel confident that it can go 2-1. But, the deck only has 4 locations total, the 3 starting ones, and a Spacesport Docking Bay, relying on Staging Areas for activation. With that in mind, I know that if I come against DB Huntdown, I lose. Oh well. Dark Side was far less difficult as I had a Maul deck that went 3-0 last tourney ("THE Maul Deck" on my page), and I knew that deck was strong. Come Saturday, my decks are WYS "mains", and "THE Maul Deck".<br/>
<br/>
This tourney was held at Seattle Star Wars Mecca "Broken Games", was run by Martin Norris (without who we would be lost), and ended up with 16 people. In attendance we had State Champ Nick Jones, Joe Olson, Michaek Mikalian (Spelling?), and on his "Farewell" Local, Charles Hickey. Basically, to win this tourney would not be easy. My rating going into this tourney was 1870.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: "THE Maul Deck" V.S. Rhys’s EBO Deck o’ Randomness<br/>
This 1st game of the tourney would be Rhy’s like 8th game of Star Wars, so not much happened. First turn I drop Maul + Saber, get out JP, move Maul over. Rhys grabs stuff with ANSB, and draws. My second turn I drop Mighty Jabba to the AU and Search and Destroy, say go. Rhys does pretty much nothing on his second turn, except deploy Kiffex. I just keep setting up on Tatooine (Mara + Saber) and force drain and S&amp;D him. Eventually Rhys deploys Karie Neth to  Kiffex, and a Planet Defender Ion Cannon (WTF) to Hoth. On my turn, I drop IGiIG2000, battle Karie and kill her. On Rhys’s next turn, Redemption and an X-Wing go the Kiffex but he can’t battle. (He still hasn’t deployed anybody to Hoth). My next turn I drain, then drop BihT followed by First Strike, he loses everything at Kiffex. From that point, I don’t think Ryhs deployed another card, and I drained him for the easy win.<br/>
Full Win by 42<br/>
2(+42)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning by a crapload.<br/>
Lows: Playing a Newbie.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS "WYS Crap" V.S. Gregg’s DB Huntdown.<br/>
Crap, well, "auto-loss" I tell myself, but I still don’t want to just give him the game. Gregg starts HD with IAO, Crush, and Mob. Points. His first turn he drops Emperor to the Cantina and grabs the Exec. Docking bay. My first turn I look for a DB and find none! Well, I just draw a couple. Gregg drains and drops Janus to the Emp., then draws looking for Vaders. My turn I drop Mirax + Skate to Tatooine, Palace Raider + Craft to DB 94, flip, and deploy Menace Fades along with the Spaceport DB. Gregg drains and drops Mara to the Spaceport. On my turn, I drain, then deploy ECC Chewie and EPP Han to Mara. I battle, and Gregg plays YAB on Chewie.Then he hits Han and draws like a 3, so I lose Han plus a couple. Gregg finally deploys Vader (to Cantina) and flips. My turn I drop Luke nextdoor to Mara, deploy a Freighter Captain to Chewie, battle Mara, play Run Luke Run! from lost pile. Luke MISSES Mara, then Gregg nails Luke. I draw a freakin’ 1 and a 2 to Gregg’s 5, so Mara covers and I lose the Captain. From here, Gregg and I just keep dropping guys and battling. I’m playing Portals and using weapons like every battle, BUT I NEVER DRAW ANYTHING HIGHER THAN A 2!!! WTF? So, to make this short, after 4 turns of battleing, I have killed Tarkin and Gregg has killed 2 Captains, 2 Lukes, 3 Raiders, Talon, and Wedge. So, basically, I run out of characters and get drained to death. (But Mirax did hold Tatooine the whole game).<br/>
Full Loss by 14<br/>
2(+28)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Lotsa Battles!<br/>
Lows:  Not winning a singe one.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: "WYS Crap" V.S. Michael Peralta’s Dark Deal Mains.<br/>
I decide to not start Insurrection and instead start YISYW in case of speed deal I can grab Menace or Battle Plan. Mike starts I’m Sorry, IAO, and TINT/OE. Mike grabs his two sites with "I’m Sorry" at the start of the game, (Incinerator and West Gallery) and deploys them alongside his starting site, the North Gallery or whatever that site is. My first turn I drop a Raider + Craft to DB 94, don’t find the Spaceport Docking Bay in my draw deck again so I Tunnel Vision for it, and deploy it with a Captain there to flip. I draw a couple and tell Mike to go, holding a Portal. Mike debates whether or not to drop on the Captain, but decides to just be patient. He grabs DD with his Obj. (he pulled Bespin first turn), and draws and saves. Well, with that one pause, the game is set. I set up another Raider + Craft at the Spaceport DB effectively locking him out of the DB’s, get set up with some good space cards, and just wait. Mike soon deploys FiS1 to the Sector with Djahs and the Port Town District, DS-61-4 at the West Gallery, and Blizzard 2 to his starting site, then he drops Dark Deal. My next turn I deploy Menace Fades, then drop the Falon with Melas and Chewie piloting with a Captain for fodder, battle Fett. He loses like 4. I move the Falcon to Bespin and set up Menace. Mike drains, then drops DiPO to the sector, my turn. Not a good move. I drain for 4, deploy Tatooine Celebration, then drop Dash and Mirax on the Outrider to Dengar, battle, lose Dengar and 15 please. I move the Outrider to Bespin and the Falcon moves to protect the Celebration. Mike can’t do much, but does drop Tempest 1 + Chiraneau to battle at the Spaceport DB. I don’t bother reacting, and he loses everything while I drop the Captain. From here, I just drain and retrieve.<br/>
Full Win by 33<br/>
4(+61)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: My crap LS winning<br/>
Lows: He never got fully set up so the game was short and easy.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: "THE Maul Deck" V.S. Joe Olson’s Hidden Base Mains<br/>
Actually, Joe’s deck wasn’t all that M&amp;T oriented, it had like 2 Bens, 2 Qui-Gons, 3 Jedi Lukes, the Super Falcon, Naked Threepio, some retrieval/Portal action, and 5 New Hope Out of Commisions. Weird. Anyway, Joe starts Hidden Base with Battle Plan, DDTA, and Insurrection. I start Landing Site + Jabba’s Palace. I drop Maul+Saber first turn and move him to JP after deploying the AU and Bad Feeling Have I. Joe drops Dagobah and Yoda’s Hut, CC Docking bay, Threepio there, then draws. My turn I grab another JP site, and just draw and wait. Joe drops another Docking Bay, then Qui-Gon to Maul, but I barrier. On my turn I debate dueling Qui-Gon, but I have idea what Joe’s destiny is like, and I don’t have a spare Maul, so I decide not to. I merely drop First Strike and battle. Joe tries to Fallen Portal but he has no force, and I weapon Lev. Qui-Gon’s saber. I swing, miss, but draw like a 5 to Joe’s 1. Joe forfiets Qui-Gon. On Joe’s turn, he drops Ben Kenobi to Maul, but doesn’t battle, and plays a couple of OOC. On my turn, I play a Monnok lost and get two Fallen Portals, and the only character I see is Jedi Luke I drop EPP Vader to Maul,and Boelo in the AU. I battle, play I Have You Now, Joe senses, I alter, he senses again. I swing and hit Ben, then realize Joe shouldn’t have been able to play the senses due to First Strike. Damn. Oh well. I still draw pretty good destiny, Joe draws a 5, he loses Ben and like 4 cards, I lose Maul. I move Vader to Boelo, and say go. Joe plays a couple OOCs but all he gets is No Escape and Qui-Gon’s Saber. He draws, and plays another OOC, and gets like an Alter or something. My next turn I decide I better start dropping mains fast, so I re-deploy Maul to the landing site and give him another Saber, then move him over to JP.<br/>
From here the game gets a bit hazy. Joe was dropping Jedi Lukes and Bens all over the place and battling. Meanwhile I was dropping Bounty Hunters and mains and battling back, but First Strike and Bad Feeling Have I gave me the edge even though Joe had deployed Savrip. Joe was also playing 2 OOCs like every turn rotation so I was careful about how I forfeited. At one point Joe deployed the Spiral and Corran Horn to Corulag so he could drain for free, but I followed him with ZiMH and BiHT and cleared him off the system in one battle. Joe started to ICBW my drains, and I had already lost my Omni Box/It’s Worse, but the battles were going my way so I was still ahead. Eventually, Joe tries to play some On the Edge’s but I sense them, and he finds he is out of characters, (I think the rest of mine were on the table), so I just drain him out.<br/>
Full Win by 17<br/>
6(+78)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Playing Joe, and seeing "THE Maul Deck" work like a charm.<br/>
Lows: None really, a very entertaining game with mass battles and minimal force drains.<br/>
<br/>
Right now the big tourney news is Kyle Kruger, the 1580 kid who played Ewoks for a year, is undefeated after beating Charles Hickey with a deck that just starts the Tatooine system and Podraces. Hmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: "THE Maul Deck" V.S. Kyle Kruger’s Tatooine Podrace.<br/>
Kyle’s starting effect is Launching the assualt so he can grab Home One, I start the same as the other games. Kyle plays Balanced Attack on my turn to grab Crix, then forgets to Podrace giving me a chance to drop Bad Feeling Have I, but my opening hand has NO characters. I search with JP, and find all 4 Mauls in my reserve, but I only count 15 out of 18 characters in my deck, so I decide to draw and get EPP Vader, EJP Dengar, and Aurra Sing. Not bad. Kyle initiates the Podrace and deploys Crix to the Podrace arena, looks for a scout bu doesn’t find one, so I get to verify. lots of good destiny, mains, Tatooine sites, and Celebration. I give him his deck back, smile, and say "We’re about to battle up in here!" Kyle is like "Damn right!"  My next turn we Podrace, I draw a 1. I drop Boelo to the AC by himself, deploy the Dungeon, then draw into GOOD cards. (Maul, his saber, DLOTS, EPP Fett, EJP Dengar, Barrier, Weapon Lev., Sniper/Dark Strike, and YAB I believe.) and before I end my turn I use Teemto’s Podracer to replace my 1, but draw another 1. Kyle notices Bad Feeling, so he deploys Obi’s Hut and drops Geezum to Crix (at the Arena) and pulls the Slave Quarters, and I am impressed. What Kyle’s deck does is start the System for Celebration, Podraces for early retrieval, then use Launching to hold the system, and Geezum safely pulls all the activation and Celebration sites he needs. Plus he plays mains for battles. Cool. <br/>
On my next turn I drop Maul and his saber and move to Obi’s Hut, ready for anything. Kyle deploys DDTA, Battle Plan, and Menace Fades, then pulls the City Outskirts and draws and saves some. My turn I pay to drain for 5, then drop Aurra to back up Boelo, and just wait. Kyle uses DDTA to grab Advantage, drops Jedi Luke + Saber + Lightsaber Profiency to Maul, but I barrier. On my turn Kyle’s race total gets to 21, and mine is only like 17, but I’m not worried. On the previous turn I had stacked a 6 and 5, so I lose one to duel Jedi Luke with Maul, and the Jedi goes down. Drain for 5 again. Sweet. Once again, I just wait. (This is what is in my hand: Sense x2, Weapon Lev. x2, Alter, DLOTS, EPP Vader, ECC Iggy, EJP Dengar, EPP Fett, Jabba’s Through w/ you, First Strike, You are Beaten, Sniper/Dark Strike, Twi’Lek Advisor, and BiHT), just waiting for that oppurtunity. Kyle deploys Shmi and Threepio via Slave Quarters, and moves them to the Arena. My turn, I drain for 5, notice Kyle only has 5 force saved, Twi’lek for Secret Plans, and Kyle decides not to place his race destiny. I just wait, just wait. Kyle’s next turn he drops another Jedi Luke (no saber) to Maul, battles, and I hit the Jedi, but he draws high and the site is cleared. He draws some, but leaves six force. On my turn, I lose the Podrace, everything goes to back to my deck, lose 6, Kyle retrieves six. I drop EPP Vader to the Landing site and move him to the Hut, hoping to distract Kyle. Well, I do, and he drops premiere Obi-Wan, and I hit the old man, the site is cleared. Kyle draws all his remaining force. I inwardly grin, as I nonchantly activate, drain, then drop Iggy, Fett, and Dengar to Shmi, Crix, Geezum, and Threepio. I drop First Strike, (Kyle responese "Oh Crap!"), then battle. I capture Geezum, shoot and Dark Srike Shmi, play Jabba’s through w/ You, draw the same 6,5 and draw a 3. Lose Threepio, Crix and 12. After that, I deploy DLOTS + Saber and move him to the Hut, start draining for 7 a turn, and that’s game.<br/>
Full Win by 27<br/>
8(+104)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Kyle’s deck, I think it has potential. "THE Maul Deck" going 3-0 again.<br/>
Lows: Podraceing, ugh.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: "WYS Crap" V.S. Nick Jones’ DB Huntdown.<br/>
This game was silly. For the 3rd time the docking bay was not in my reserve, Nick drops Emperor first turn, then in his next two turns backs him up with Vader, Tarkin, Sim, and Janus. Meanwhile, my hand is full of characters, but I;m only activating 7 a turn and can’t deploy ANYWHERE due to his mains all over my sites. I never get a power flip, so I never stay flipped, and once ZiMH and BihT go to Tatooine and I lose all my ships to drains, this game just sucks.<br/>
Full Loss by 40<br/>
<br/>
Final Score: 8(+64)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Absolutely none. Nick plays for blood and "the win" and has a terrible playing manner, and my deck just sucked it up.<br/>
Lows: 7 force a turn, that’s terrible.<br/>
<br/>
So, the scores are announced and I edge out Joe by 2 for a second place finish, behind Nick (like last week), pick up a Twi’Lek foil, and pull Naked Threepio, Aurra Sing, and Daroe from my packs. Not bad, but not great. We all say thank you to Martin, and Hickey mentions he might come next week for the free tourney. (farwell my ass).<br/>
