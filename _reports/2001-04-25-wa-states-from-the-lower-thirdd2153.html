LS-Modified Avatar*s Quiet Mining Colony<br/>
DS-My improved fairly standard Court Deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Court vs. Stanley Gu*s (1444) Profit<br/>
<br/>
Well this is going to be an interesting Game.  I start Power of the Hutt, All Wrapped Up and No Bargain. He starts Seeking An Audience with the Signal.  Well I draw my 8 and get exactly squat, I get Bossk in Bus, Lateral Damage, The Sarlacc (ok they was not bad), The Cantina and 4 other Red cards. So I activate deploy the Sarlacc and the Cantina and draw the remaining card Mara Jade Cool. He Deploys Artoo using Seeking and searches for A Gift  using Artoo but it is not there so I get to verify and look through most of his deck and there is not much except Mains and Tusken Breathing masks.  My turn I get Mara down at the Cantina and use court to look for a DB, no DB but while I am there I go ahead and grab Mara*s Stick and a Vibro Ax for Snoova and let him examine the rest.  <br/>
So we go a few turns I searches using seek and says there is nothing there for him to pull so I go to verify and find a Tamtel Skreej so I make him pull it and he deploys to the DB 94 I ended up battling and capturing him with IG-88 w/gun and haul him back to the AC.  This is where I make a colossal mistake on his next turn he drops Master Luke, Sergeant Doallyn and Princess Leia Organa as captive to Snoova, which flips my objective. My Turn I add Jodo to help out and instead of moving thinking I can draw a Trap Door and feed one of my captives to the Rancor that I pulled and deployed. What I should have done was move them to the dungeon and retrieved the only 4 cards I had lost so far and had IG-88 escort them to there doom. Next turn he drops EJP 3-Po to the AC with some scrub and battles, this is where My mistake costs me he target Snoova with Master Lukes ability and Snoova comes back to hand and Leia is released so he retrieves 5 I Shoot Doallyn with Boba and when it is all said and done master Luke and Boba are the only ones left standing. He moves Master Luke to the Great Pit.  Next turn I drain and draw trying to get something useful. He drains and drops Tamtel and a scrub to the AC and battles well I hit Tamtel with the blaster but I do not get a destiny, so there goes Boba and han is released. Well he heads into his Move phase and I say whoa slow down Sarlacc attacks Master Luke every battle phase and he says OK and I draw the destiny for the Sarlacc a 5 for 9 total and he draws a 2 for 7 total and Master Luke is eaten.  His turn He drops Chewie Protector and scrub and battle Mara at the Cantina well Mara Slices Chewie and he draws a 1 and  I draw a 5 so it is a 9 to 9 tie and he loses both. Next turn I drain and get a few people out when they call time so he finishes which is nothing cause we has 1 drain of 1 and we count.  He counts 31 and I count 25 I lose by basically 1 turn of drains. <br/>
<br/>
TL (-31)<br/>
0 (-31)<br/>
<br/>
HL: A very good interactive game once things got rolling.<br/>
LL: Things did not get rolling until 45 minute into the game.<br/>
Props: to Stan for taking advantage of my error and not stalling when he was down quite a bit.<br/>
Slops: Me not feeding the Rancor when I had the chance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My Quiet Mining Colony vs. Tom Ryan (1388) Agents of the Black Sun.<br/>
<br/>
I had not idea what to expect I have been working on my on AOTBS deck so I know what it does I just was not sure what he was going to try to do.  I starts IAO, Mob. Points and some other card that really did not do much so I do not remember. I started Menace, Squadron Assignments and Do or Do Not/Wise Advise.  Well it started off slow with him on Coruscant and me on CC I get setup Flip and get Celebration Going by about turn 4. He mean while has gotten a bunch of DB*s out and flipped. Well I cannot find Luke or his ship to pull him but it is not hurting as I am retrieving 2 or 3 a turn with celebration. I had the Outrider with Dash and a Ralltiir Freighter Captain and Pulsar Skate with Mirax at Bespin and he has been save force and drops Stinger, Virago, Zuckuss in MH and Bossk in Bus to Bespin. I had been holding an out of nowhere just in case.  He initiated Battle and drew a 2 and 2 for destiny after I had dropped Bossk in Bus to 0 power, and play out of nowhere and draw a tracked (the only reason I bring this up is I have never been very good at tracking) 6 and a 3 so he loses the Bus and ZinMH and because I had played No Questions Asked Earlier My ships are immune to attrition less than 7 so I lose nothing he retreats to a system he had deployed earlier and I move the Skate to Bespin CC. By now he has a Healthy force at a the platform on Endor. So I start consolidating my people at the lower corridor and deploy Luke w/ stick there and drain for 3 with Pucumir.  The nice thing about Quiet Mining Colony is if you do not use the DB and they cannot find theirs or do not have one the only way to get to you is Ellis.  Well he finally found his East plat form and used transit. Then he marched over to where I was. He put a Bounty on Lando with Blaster.  Well I use No Questions Asked to sniper at one of his people during my Control Phase and missed. So I went ahead an initiated Battle I would have ended the game here if he had not had Guri as I could have drawn 6 Battle destiny but I took out 3 of his guys dropping there Forfeit to 0 with Han, Leia and Lando with guns and tried to slash Guri and missing by 1. Well we each draw our 1 destiny I draw a 4 and he drew a 2 and I forfeit Wedge Antilles and say go. Well basically he moves away and I drain him out 2 turns later. <br/>
FW +20<br/>
2 (-11)<br/>
<br/>
HL: Winning against a decent deck that challenged mine.<br/>
LL: not much<br/>
<br/>
Props: he was losing cards all over the place but never lost his cool. <br/>
Slops: Forfeiting ZinMH and the Bus instead of Stinger and the Virago to cover attrition he would have stayed in the game a little longer. And to the idiot that messed up there pairings because he did not no the difference between a - and +.<br/>
<br/>
Well I feel good I am 1-1 and still feel like I am in the area that I feel comfortable in. <br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My Quiet Mining Colony vs. Tristan Zimmer (1500) Ral Ops <br/>
<br/>
Well this is not some thing I had expected.  I start my stuff he starts with 3 effects that I did not bother writing down because they were not going to have much impact.  Well I am not sure what to expect figuring bikers or AT-ST*s; rather than take the Battle to him I play my deck using my interior sites and flip so he cannot modify my drains or cancel them once I flip.  Well, we get going and he searching and getting Site out an has a couple plain Troopers Out and I am get flipped about turn 3 cause I cannot find Lando. Well I should have beat him down early cause he Ellis* to where my crew has gathered and performs a Trooper Assault Beat down at least I took out a few of them with weapons fire. I had to lose all but 1 person to attrition (this was a game breaking mistake as I had Savrip out on turn 2 and could have forfeited and covered it all from hand and launched a beat on my turn. so we play cat and mouse because I can not draw squat.  I Grimtash lost figuring he has at least a duplicate trooper assault or trooper in hand nope not a single duplicate in the bunch.  Well that was a waste. He drops a Baron Fel in Saber I and a Dread to Bespin and we battle some how I lose Melas and he moves away he spreads and drains me out.<br/>
FL -26 aprox.<br/>
Total 2 (-37 or so)<br/>
<br/>
HL: none this game was terrible I am surprised the differential was so low.<br/>
LL: See HL<br/>
<br/>
Props: He brought the game to me and my deck crumbled.<br/>
Slops: Me for not thinking that anyone would play a RalOps Trooper beat down any more.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
<br/>
My Court vs. Justin **Dinky Winkie** Ryan (1421) Rebel Strike Team<br/>
<br/>
I start the usual and he starts but I have not a clue what his starting effects were. He posted a TR and does not say so it must not have had an impact. Well we get going and I start pulling stuff and with Power of the Hutt and deploy Guri and IG-with Gun at on of his sites and he starts sweating. Buy turn 5 I had control of Endor with Zuckuss and Bossk in their rides and a the too droids making him worry and consolidate his forces at the platform. He is losing to my drains and to Court cause  he did not want to challenge me on Tat. I had lost the Sarlacc to an early drain but the Rancor was still there. I got the pit in a draw and deployed it and used Power to get the Hutt mobile and proceeded to transport a whole beat down crew to the platform. Next turn he decides to battle, BAD IDEA, he had no idea what I had there evidently he was not paying attention, because all he saw was 5 aliens, 3 droids and a Barge against his 10-12 man crew. Well with everyone on the barge being immune to attrition &lt;6 he was in for it even without two of the people I had. I had Mighty Jabba, Ephant Mon, Boelo, Jodo Kast, Boba Fett w/ Gun IG-88 w/ Gun, 4-LOM w/ gun and Guri. Well 4-LOM canceled Obi-wan*s Game text, and IG-88 missed capturing Chewbacca of Kashyyyk and hit General Solo with Boba Fett*s Gun. Boelo Canceled his only battle destiny and I drew five-battle destiny and he chose to cancel 1 using a card I cannot remember, 1 for ability, 1 for Mighty Jabba*s game text, 1 for Ig-88*s game text, 1 for Boba Fett*s Game text and add the final one using Jabba*s Through With You I believe. I drew a 5,4,1,3 and he canceled a 2. So he Forfeits Obi and someone else and I use All Wrapped Up to get Obi to IG-88.  Here he makes another mistake he cannot move everyone away so he stay put rather than transiting to DB 94.  Well I have another Jabba*s Through With You in Hand so I activate and battle same scenario only he is down more people I draw a 5, 4, 2, 1 and 3, and he loses everything there. Now I make a mistake that while not costing me the game severely affected my differential for this game, which would have affected who I played in Game 5 (remember this).  I Transit to DB 94and say go. He is low on Force so all he does is Activate and drain. So My turn I Drain and Move the barge to the Great Pit but for get to have Ig-88 disembark and walk hi prisoner into the AC. To shorten this up I drained him out 1 turn before I could feed Obi to the Rancor. What I should have done was had Jodo And Boba fly to the furthest sight to block drains and had Ephant, Jabba and Boelo move to the Adjacent site to block that drain while I moved the droids over to feed the Rancor this would have result in at least 10 more differential because he only had 2 lame scouts at each of the site and as long as I did not Battle and only drained I would not have lost any force and been able to retrieve when obi was eaten. As it was I got the full win by 18.<br/>
FW +18<br/>
Total 4 (-19) or so<br/>
<br/>
HL: Winning and Dominating his space location to keep him from flipping<br/>
LL: losing the Sarlacc to an early drain.<br/>
<br/>
Props: To me for take the Battle to him and beating him on his planet.<br/>
Slops: To me for not thinking out my moves better. Him for not running when he had the chance.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
My Quiet Mining Colony vs. Andrew Taylor (1437) Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi <br/>
<br/>
Ok remember that mistake last game 2 more differential points and I play someone else that is not playing Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi.  This is the only deck that I have no chance of beating.  I have been looking forward to playing Andrew for a while, he is 9 but has been playing at least 4 years and regardless of his rating is a good player. So I am stuck I had figured I would be playing fellow scrubs all day 99% of which would not be playing Hunt Down, I get the only one that did. Please pardon the lack of detail as between lack of defense and Card draws like Game 3 (lousy) I got my A$$ handed to me by a 9 year old.  We start and first turn he gets out Vader to my site first turn luckily I start Guest Quarters so it is activation of 2 but only a drain of 1 for him. My turn I get out the Pulsar Skate with Mirax using the Squassin and Bespin Cloud City. Well we end up matching drains for 6 or so turns I am losing to visage the entire Game as I have no way to cancel it. So I have drawn a few here and there and Rather than get more ships out and just make it a Drain race. I drop a lone Han w/ gun and holding Houjix in hand to Vader/Tarkin like an idiot so he cancels my weapon Destiny with Tarkin and I get no battle destiny, should have waited until I could drop a few more people. Well that did not hurt to bad but did not have the desired effect either. Well I final get Luke with Saber and drop him and few others against Mara and Janus and battle at the Lower Corridor well I slash Janus but do not draw high enough to get Mara and I lose a Scrub his next turn he moves Beat down crew to me and Mara away and initiates duel between Vader and Luke Well I think I have a shot because there was no way he was tracking so I flip to 5 and a 4 and think that I have little shot at making this well he flips a 3 so I think well maybe I have a shot at a draw and then he flips a 6 well I just lost a duel by 1 DOH!  So I let Luke cross over and lose 7 because losing 21 and him was not an option that would have ended it right there well he continues to out drain and damage me and all I can do is try to make him lose as much as I can to get the differential down.  Well I do not do a very good job of this I Grimtash used when I should have waited till my turn and played it lost but All in all it was very ugly.<br/>
FL (-31)<br/>
Total 4 (-50)<br/>
<br/>
HL: None<br/>
LL: Re-Read the details.<br/>
<br/>
Props: to Andrew for dominate this game from the start.<br/>
Slops: to me for not having any thing to counter Hunt Down and not Going to space and staying there.<br/>
<br/>
Well I need a win her to keep from sinking to the depths of scrubdum.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:<br/>
<br/>
My Court vs. D.J. Peralta (1871) TIGIH Scouts <br/>
<br/>
D.J. is the only player I have ever played more than once with the exception of a friend of mine.  There is a little history hear from Regionals game 1 last year see that report for why I am not liking D.J. much. Any way I start my usual and he starts Strike Planning and a few other things that did not affect the game.  Well once again the opening draw sticks it to me a bunch of red and Dengar with Gun and Mandalorian Armor. Well I use Power of the Hut to get some stuff out to the AC and he ends up Bo Shuda there so there goes my only drain and I am Drawing Crap and losing 4 or 5 to drains I finally get Ig-88 and 4-LOM out and then drop Dr. E/Ponda with the Armor and Dengar to a sit where he has Wuta and Obi W/stick. Well Wuta gets blasted and he has to forfeit Obi who is captured via All Wrapped Up and 4lom is gone to cover Attrition. IG-88 and Obi head back to the docking platform and toward the AC I had got the Sarlacc out early and he had lost a few to my Objective. He transits to Tat. and uses the scout that gives all other scouts land speed of 2 when moving with him to skip over the Sarlacc and spread into the Palace and drain at the dungeon and Rancor pit. Well I get Obi to the AC and then back out to the Sarlacc. Up until I captured Obi I was facing a 35-card loss but now I felt I had a shot. I drain where I can and attempt to feed Obi to the Sarlacc and miss I drew a 2 and here a big sigh from D.J. which has me a little Baffled because he did not draw a destiny and I move Dengar W/gun and Dr. E/Ponda with the Armor to the same site as Luke RS and scrub who are draining for 3.  Well ok so he drains and initiates battle at Luke*s site he goes Dr. E and Ponda are minus 3 power because of Luke*s stick that he had deployed earlier I say fine because the armor makes them plus 2 armor 5 and immune to attrition. So he slashes and Dengar and misses and I Fire hit the Scrub and Operate to make him lost. We both draw destiny and he flips a 0 while I flip a 5 he loses Luke to cover and asks if I want to take him with All Wrapped Up I count how much force I have left and find I do not have enough time to get Luke back to the Sarlacc before the 2 force lose to his Objective kills me off so I say no and Luke is lost. Well 3 Turns later he drains me out after the Sarlacc eats Obi on the turn after battle he did not draw destiny again and had to lose 8 force and place Obi OOP.<br/>
FL (-14)<br/>
Final 4(-64)<br/>
<br/>
HL: Feeding Obi to the Sarlacc and that was about it.<br/>
LL: Not drawing squat and having him take over the Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Props: to Him for packing Bo Shuda since many here play court and for taking the battle to me unlike his friend Justin in Game 4 and to Me for knocking 20 off the differential and coming close to pulling win from the jaws of defeat.<br/>
Slops; to my deck and the opening hand god*s for killing me fro a third time today.<br/>
