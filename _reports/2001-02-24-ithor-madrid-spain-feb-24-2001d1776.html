Sorry, there’s no pretourney this time. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I didn’t go past weekend to the tourney, so I’m anxious to play. I have played a couple friendly games since then and I’ve lost most of them, so I’m a bit worried... so I change some cards and that’s all. I know I will see some Watch Your Step decks and since I haven’t playtested vs. them I dont know how if I will do well. But I see that objective can be a problem. <br/>
<br/>
I have playtested my LS deck against Hunt Down and Scum decks, and it eats them alive (well, about 75%). I’d like to eat Tie Swarm decks, too. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Decks:<br/>
Dark Side: My Take On Prodigy (going 3-1 in tourneys -with a timed lose).<br/>
Light Side: My Take On Hidden Mains (going 2-0).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Bye. <br/>
I go buy the newspaper and have a coffee. That’s good. Get back to the store and a couple players let me see the game they’re playing. It’s my friend Victor vs. Mario Tarin’s ISB/Scum deck. Things are getting nasty for Victor, so I trade some cards, buy a couple Reflections2 packs, wander around, etc... when I get back to see how it’s going, Victor loses by 29. Ouch! <br/>
<br/>
FW +0 (2 +0)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: The coffee. 2 points, baby!<br/>
Lowlights: I dont play, and differential will probably cost me the tourney. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS vs. Victor?’s Watch Your Step.<br/>
Okay, lets face this objective. I go with No Bargain, Power Of The Hutt and Secret Plans. He starts Squadron Assignments, Staging Areas and Battle Plan. My turn, deploy Hutt Influence from Reserve, search for DS: War Room and see Tatooine: Jabba’s Palace is in my Force pile, so I just draw and get it, along with Scum &amp; Villainy and Brangus Glee. He goes, deploys Kessel and the Falcon with somebody there. I deploy T: Jabba’s Palace, Audience Chamber from Reserve, get another DS: docking into hand, deploy Brangus to the War Room, Scum to the Chamber, followed by Jabba, Gailid and Boelo. His turn, he drains, I Control, exchange the Control with a docking bay. He then decides to come after Brangus with Jedi Luke with saber, who moves to the War Room. At this point, I know I’m going to win this game. My turn, use 3 force to drain, deploy Bib (from hand) and Boelo (from reserve) to T: JP, Search And Destroy (he will lose a ton of cards because of this). He goes, uses 3 and drains me for 3 at Kessel, I play Control and retrieve it into hand with a docking, then I retrieve both dockings into hand with Put All Sections On Alert. Uses another 3 and drains for 3 with Luke (I lose crap from hand). He’s short of cards in hand, so he just draw a few. My turn, use 6 to drain for 4 (off the top, Mossep was on table, too), deploy Blast Door Controls, First Strike, Zuckuss In Mist Hunter to Kessel (where he has the Falcon, Han and Lando), retrieve 3, he loses, 1, play Projective Telepathy and cancel the battle. Then Zuckuss moves to Tatooine, and Brangus back to the War Room. He drains for 3, I play Control and get it back with a docking, and drains for 2 more (I lose more crap from hand). He deploys Pulsar Skate and Wedge to Tatooine, I Rebel Barrier him, he deploys Mirax Terrik there, too, and Order To Engage. Then he moves Jedi Luke to face my poor Brangus at the War Room... <br/>
I drain for 4 (off the top thanx to Mossep, and remember Search &amp; Destroy is hitting all the time). It happens that the card sitting on top of my Lost Deck is Brangus Glee. So I look for a docking, excange Brangus into hand, deploy Boba With Gun, 4LOM with gun and Dengar With Gun and battle Jedi Luke, I retrieve, he loses. He fails and doesn’t hit anybody, and I lose Boba to attrition. And the Jedi dies, of course. I draw, get Put All Sections On Alert in hand, exchange for the docking bays again, the next turn he drains for 3, I play Control, exchange it with a docking bay, deploy Boba Fett In Slave 1, battle, retrieve, cancel the battle with Projective Telepathy... <br/>
<br/>
FW +21 (4 +21)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Winning vs. a WYS deck. <br/>
Lowlights: Nothing. <br/>
The Ugly: He never flipped his objective. Brangus &amp; Control combo. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS vs. Ignacio Esteban’s Watch Your Step/funky retrieval.<br/>
It’s been a long time we dont play each other, but I know I will have competition. As ever, we menace each other, and joke and prepare for a tough one. This is 2 in a row I play vs WYS... He starts Menace Fades, Insurrection, and another I cant remember and I start the same as 2nd game. I get Hutt Influence out, deploy DS: War Room and draw to get T: Jabba’s Palace. He goes and gets out the classic Kessel, Falcon and Han. I deploy Jabba’s Palace, search for the Chamber, for a docking bay, deploy Scum to the chamber along with Gailid (from reserve), Jabba, Ephant Mon &amp; Boelo to T:JP, and Search &amp; Destroy (he will lose every turn for it, except a turn I forgot...) . Also, I deploy Secret Plans using a Twilek Advisor (this card was probably game). Next turn he drains at Kessel, deploys Lando to the Falcon, Pulsar Skate with Mirax and Wedge to Alderaan, moves them to Death Star and I go. Deploy Blast Door Controls, First Strike, Zuckuss In Mist Hunter pays a visit to the Falcon, battle-I-retrieve (3)-you-lose (1), Projective Telepathy, move Zuckuss to Tatooine. He deploys Chewie Protector and Melas to a Tatooine site and flips the objective, but it only takes me 2 turns to clean that site, retrieving cards with Scum, then, Search &amp; Destroy hits again. He retrieves some cards here and there, but Secret Plans slows him a lot. Then, he decides he doesnt like Gailid and deploys Jedi Luke to the Chamber when I only have 2-3 cards in hand, and it happens one of them is None Shall Pass, so this is finished, cause thanx to Mossep it’s impossible for him to deploy, and retrieval. <br/>
<br/>
FW +10 (6 +31)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Winning again vs. WYS, and against Ignacio. :-) <br/>
Lowlights: Nothing.<br/>
The Ugly: Brangus and Control combo. It’s near to broken. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS. vs. Ignacio Esteban’s Agents Of Black Sun. <br/>
Well, I dont want to remember a lot about this game. Let’s say I have never played well against capturing decks, and this one was worse. I cant understand how it could happen, but in his second turn he captured Jedi Luke with Anakin’s saber and Chewie Protector, and I was very sad, cause I initiated that battle. Next stupid thing I did was moving Ben with saber to the Audience Chamber, controlling it and NOT cancelling Scum &amp; Villainy. His turn, an alien galore hit the Chamber and had fun with old Ben. Since I had Order To Engage out (what a joke), he also battled me at another site, so hard that I had to lose my life force so he will not retrieve more next turn... <br/>
<br/>
FL -29 (6 +2)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Playing Ignacio<br/>
Lowlights: Losing so bad. I played like a scrub.<br/>
The Ugly: I’m stupid, if I had won this game I’d won the tourney. I’m a loser.<br/>
<br/>

1. Miguel Tarin (6 +a lot).<br/>
