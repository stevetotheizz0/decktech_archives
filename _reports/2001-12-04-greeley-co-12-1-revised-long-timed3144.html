We Brought Brian Hunter along with us and this was Chris 6 month return tourney.  He went 4-2 and was really happy, he took the time off work to go to this last Greeley tourney.  We bring Brian with us along with my Friend Cody Jewell; we all come in big hopes of placing high.<br/>

<br/>
Tom McGee YMSYL Garrison drains<br/>
<br/>
He starts of all the YMSYL stuff.  I start my normal stuff.  He starts off by getting Vader and Tarkin to Hoth early.  I get Captain Han with Chewbacca Protector to Kessel, The outrider with Dash and Melas to Tatooine and a palace raider in patrol craft with Talon Karrde and Mirax to the Spaceport DB.  He drops a walker and a character to there and tramples the patrol craft.  He then misses a trample on Talon Karrde cause of his game text, I drop more characters and we fight.  I Out of commission some cards and retrieve some.  He never gets anything-big going and its agreed he hat the worst draw ever well until he played his deck the second time.<br/>
FW +19 2(19)<br/>
Props: Tom was fun to play with.<br/>
Slops: not too interactive.<br/>
<br/>
Cody Jewell EBO pods<br/>
<br/>
Hmm ok time to play one of the three people I came with.  He starts EBO podracing with ANSB and I start Phantom menace instead of Wattos box.  First turn I stall Anakins pod and draw a 6.  I draw some cards and we lose to visage.  He pulls sites and plays some sites and we lose to visage.  My turn we draw he draws pretty low and I draw a 5 draw a few more cards and lose to visage.  He continues setting up and then we lose to visage.  He step backwards and I grab it. I draw a 6 and he draws low.  I deploy Vader flip and make him lose to visage.  He gets EBO out and Naboo but doesnt have force for ships.  He loses to visage.  I activate and draw race destiny I have enough to win.  I retrieve my pile and draw one card its Maul.  He loses to visage.  He plays some ships to Naboo and lets me go.  I drain put maul in his ship there (Tatooine maul) and let him go.  He drops Corran Horn on spiral initiates organized attacks and I havta lose maul and card from hand.  I drain him out.<br/>
FW +34 4(53)<br/>
Props: To me for handing him his @$$ its going to be a long 3hour ride home.<br/>
Slops: To his deck for not doing anything.<br/>
<br/>
Brian Hunter WYS<br/>
<br/>
Well he is Playing WYS; I am playing HD My Way I get wrecked.  Well its a long game and playing the #1 rated player in the world its kind of hard to get any offense going.  I flip and win the podrace, he It could be worses but I its worse for a bit and he doesnt have his its a hit.  He retrieves a lot and then I drop Mara and cross Luke to the dark side.  He attacks Mara and crossed Luke with Phylo and Han.  He hits crossed Luke and I hit Han and Mara survives the battle.  He has palace raiders everywhere and this is where it all gets weird.  I drop Tatooine maul in his ship to Tatooine.  He just lost Kessel to a force drain.  Now he goes from draining for free retrieving with celebration and force draining plus one at his docking bays to a canceled celebration no force drain bonus, menace fades no longer suspending Maras +1 for saber and needs to pay for battle plan.  Well he gets a lands his ship and embarks Melas, next turn he launches then he beats up on maul and drains me out<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;21 4(32).<br/>
Props: Maul for being able to influence the game so much<br/>
Slops: umm I didn&amp;#8217;t win what a surprise =P<br/>
<br/>
Tom Meade Light Saber Combat dark<br/>
<br/>
He is playing Lightsaber Combat and my WYS is setting up too slow.  He gets maul with a presence of the force to the core and is draining me for three.  All game he pays to drain me but I fail to mount anything to fight back.  Late game I lower his differential as much as possible but winning is out of the question.<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;14 4(18)<br/>
Props: To Tom for winning<br/>
Slops: To me for losing<br/>
<br/>
Well the competition seems pretty hard here with only 10 players and about 4 people that I am worried about playing.<br/>
<br/>
Tony Fanchi Senate Naboo drains<br/>
<br/>
He starts off Senate I have never beaten senate.   He flips about third turn and I flip right after.  I set up docking bay drains but never get the celebration going.  Not much happened.  He drained me with Vader and Blizzard four at battle plains I drained, not too interactive.  In the end I won, cant remember too much about this game.<br/>
FW +25 6(43)<br/>
Props: I won<br/>
Slops: Cant remember much about this game, it was already about 11:00 pm and I had not much sleep<br/>
<br/>
Well final game now and I am tired as hell.  Being 3-2 I really need to win cause going 3-3 sounds like a bad idea.<br/>
<br/>
Chris Compton Hidden Base Pods<br/>
<br/>
Hmm he beat me the last time I played this and its a bad match up for me.  I decide not to play Wattos box but I start security precautions.  He flips pretty early and the podrace is going nowhere fast since he step backwards me and keeps drawing low.  I get maul in his ship and probe his system, he loses 9 force I flip and he loses to visage the rest of the game.  He dropped Luke with Lightsaber to fight Vader, I try to duel but he cancels it, he initiates and hits Vader.  I Vaders eye and I have you now and draw 5 5 6 1 he loses Luke and a lot more and I lose Vader, next turn I no escape to get Vader drop him and he continues to lose to visage.  I end up with a lot of cards in hand and he just stacks his last two life force on the podrace that never ended while I only had one destiny on Sebulba.<br/>
FW +22 8(65)<br/>
<br/>
Props: to the dark Jedi for being pimps everywhere.<br/>
Slops: to the podrace for not ending.<br/>
<br/>
So I end up in third behind Brian hunter and Chris Fanchi.  I played all three people who I rode up to the tourney with and beat Chris and Cody.<br/>
