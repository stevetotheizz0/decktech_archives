Hi all, long time since I last wrote a tournament report.  <br/>
I was Light in last weeks ECC sealed, so I didnt really <br/>
want to write about that ;-)  Todays tournament was a <br/>
Swiss open with lots of prizes run at Australia on Collins.  <br/>
I decided to play a MWYHL M&amp;T deck, without emphasis on <br/>
beatdown, but using funky Threepio tech and, of course, <br/>
plenty of high destinies.  I was a bit stuck for dark <br/>
because I wanted to play something strong, but didnt have <br/>
any dark ECC so I played a Stuart Jones inspired ops deck <br/>
with Kashyyk for cancelling TPTIFF.  I turned up and <br/>
realised that I only owned one Abyssin Ornament so I <br/>
chucked in an extra operative and a reactor terminal.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1 DS vs. Bengs MWYHL Brentsons Beats<br/>
<br/>
Well, Beng was playing Michael Josems regionals deck and I <br/>
was playing Stuarts, so we were in for a hell of a long <br/>
match (see Michaels tournament report of the Calamari <br/>
Regionals if you dont know what happened).  I started off <br/>
with a couple of ops and grabbed my reactor terminal.  I <br/>
think I flipped early with a bunch of AT-STs.  Beng got out <br/>
TPTIFF and for some reason got EPP Luke out to complete JT1.  <br/>
At this point I was afraid that test 2 was coming, but it <br/>
never reared its ugly head.  Beng committed his mains and <br/>
I deployed IAO, battle plan was out but I occupied space.  I <br/>
ran away from a lot of battles at the beginning, preferring <br/>
to fight later when I had decent stuff out (I never drew a <br/>
Vader).  Towards the end it looked as if I had enough <br/>
momentum to drain Beng out, but Terry called time.  I <br/>
counted 18, Beng had 19 and I sat there looking like an <br/>
idiot with reactor terminal and 2 cards in hand.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Bengs one of the nicest people to play against.<br/>
Lowlights :  Timed loss by 19? #$%&amp; off!<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2 LS vs Chians CCT Scum and Villainy<br/>
<br/>
Chian was playing sabacc as well as trying to flip the <br/>
objective.  He got a lightining-slow start, picking up <br/>
heaps to try and avoid a massive beatdown (am I that <br/>
intimidating?).  I sat there picking up to get a traffic <br/>
control, looking through my deck to see if there are any <br/>
grimtaashes in my force pile.  Theres one, but I miss it <br/>
because I deployed a bacta tank.  He dumps down a whole <br/>
bunch of guys to the Carbon Chamber and Im happy to just <br/>
dump Obi-Wan at the pub and an Insurrection (told you I <br/>
wasnt focused on beatdown).  After freezing Wedge, he gets <br/>
some guys at the AC and then starts sabaccing, this is when <br/>
I kick myself for throwing out my ONE grapple and a <br/>
Projection of a Skywalker.  We have some battles and I end <br/>
up controlling cloud city.  Being only able to use aliens, <br/>
Chian eats a drain at Kessel for about 8 turns before <br/>
putting Fett in Slave I down and, despite the fact that I <br/>
have about a 12 card reserve deck and at least half of it <br/>
is destiny 5 or more, I just cant seem to kill it!  Im <br/>
draining for a lot, but hes retrieving enough to stay in <br/>
and just ekes out a win by 2.  <br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Winning about half of the sabacc we played.<br/>
Lowlights :  Would the world just explode if I had a little <br/>
bit of luck?  Come on, one 5 over about 5-6 battles isnt <br/>
unreasonable!<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3 LS vs Tristans ISB ops/Dark Deal<br/>
<br/>
Tristan is from interstate, so I had no idea what to expect <br/>
from him.  When I saw ISB and IAO I nearly had a heart <br/>
attack envisioning my small army of decent characters <br/>
chasing his mob of random crap across the galaxy, all the <br/>
while depleting my reserve deck.  The first location that <br/>
Tristan deployed was Cloud City.  Here was my first sign of <br/>
hope.  On about his 3rd turn Tristan got out Bespin with <br/>
Sunsdown on it and about 4 ISB duded at the casino.  I <br/>
signalled for TPTIFF instead of Traffic Control and parked <br/>
it at Dagobah next to the Tantive.  He drains for one and I <br/>
look at the disarmed in my hand but decide to lose it off <br/>
the top.  There goes Traffic Control.  Seriously, a little <br/>
bit of luck wouldnt go astray.  Maybe Ill get some for <br/>
Christmas.  Maybe.  Tristan only gets out about 3 locations, <br/>
a hit squad clears one out, Obi-Wan with his rusty - err <br/>
trusty- stick beat up some more crappy guys.  At this point <br/>
the situation is looking ok although Im not causing him any <br/>
damage, but I finally get out Order To Engage. Vader and an <br/>
entire legion of resurrected crap decide to take on my guys <br/>
and its just a massacre.  EPPs + destiny rig is some good, <br/>
although he has enough guys that he can lose the 3 that are <br/>
hit an forfeit another few.  Bossk in Bus and a Dreadnaught <br/>
set up an occupation and the Falcon decides to take them on.  <br/>
The worst battle in history ensues, both of us drawing 0s.  <br/>
As you can tell, this game is dragging out but wait- on the <br/>
horizon - its a main, its a plane, its R-3P0!  He comes <br/>
out with all guns blazing, forcing the ISB agents to fight <br/>
me, but its all to late.  Another timed loss that I think <br/>
I couldve won (arent I @#$%y?)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Super R-3P0, hero of the rebellion, mercilessly <br/>
hunting down ISB agents.<br/>
Lowlights :  Our TD, Terry Lyons, feels sick somewhere <br/>
around here and goes home.  <br/>
<br/>
GAME 4 DS vs Tristans Hidden Base<br/>
<br/>
Allright, its Stuarts deck, and Stuart doesnt lose to <br/>
hidden base, does he?  Does he?  Nope.  Not much to tell, <br/>
I flipped early, converted Coruscant, probed with Security <br/>
Precautions, prevented any beatdown (there was none, but I <br/>
had ghhks and imperial barriers) and played my SOLE Abyssin <br/>
Ornament for 6.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  What- you mean I finally get to win a game?!<br/>
Lowlights :  Boring deck vs boring deck.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 5 DS vs Ronnies Endor Objective<br/>
<br/>
Great  Im playing the only deck that has difficulty <br/>
stopping this deck from blowing up the bunker.  Oh well, <br/>
I guess Im just starting the game with 8 less force.  <br/>
Ronnie is out for revenge after I drew 4 battle destiny <br/>
against him in last weeks ECC sealed and makes no effort to <br/>
conceal the fact that hes going to try and beat the living <br/>
$%^&amp; out of my ops, with an ASP droid and ewok catapults <br/>
sitting on Endor.  He blows up the bunker surprisingly <br/>
quickly and gets out Kessel and Dagobah.  I see TPTIFF cycle <br/>
around about 3 times before being lost to a force drain- <br/>
phew!  Ronnie sets up a massive beatdown with EPP Han, <br/>
Chewie and the Endor effect that makes Life Debt used and <br/>
some scouts.  Fortunately, I barrier Han, Ronnie doesnt <br/>
fight and I then use my tracked destiny to squish Chewie.  <br/>
The Executor makes a guest appearance to stop the drain at <br/>
Kessel and I quickly drain him out.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Winning a game when I started off with a <br/>
massive disadvantage.<br/>
Lowlights :  This game seemed fairly one-sided.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 6 LS vs Ronnies CCT Scum and Villainy<br/>
<br/>
Well, it starts out the same as game 2, with Ronnie taking <br/>
IG-88 and the JP Dungeon into hand and me giving him Wedge.  <br/>
Ronnie gets All Wrapped Up out early and I sit there <br/>
debating what to do.  We both pick up and I get a used <br/>
Grimtaash off.  Obi-Wan goes to the Chamber to drain, but <br/>
gets the living daylights beaten out of him and IG-88 <br/>
holds him with the binders (Ronnie did say that he wanted <br/>
his revenge!), although I do manage to move an ugnaught <br/>
away.  Next turn I beat down on the ugnaught with Jeroen <br/>
Webb and Tawss Khaa.  I finally decide that I want my guys <br/>
back, so I send Luke to the chamber to slice up IG-88.  He <br/>
manages to kill him after Obi-Wan missed being frozen, but <br/>
I still get Wedge and someone else back.  At this point Im <br/>
more or less in control of Cloud City, so Ronnie runs to <br/>
Tatooine and I project both sites.  Ronnie gets some gamblers <br/>
out, but its not very hard for me to win the wagers.  <br/>
Kiffex shows up and, once again, I drain him out.  <br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Knowing how to beat this deck.<br/>
Lowlights :  IG-88 + Binders + All Wrapped Up was better <br/>
than R-3P0. Nooo!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I finish up on 6(+30 something) after a horrible start <br/>
to the day and manage to come about 10th.  Despite being <br/>
left to run the tournament, Michael manages to come first ;-)   <br/>
Everyone ended up with about 5 rares, 2 packs of Cloud City <br/>
and 2 of Premiere (told you there were heaps of prizes) to <br/>
conclude the last tournament before the new year.<br/>
<br/>
Terry              :  Get better soon.<br/>
Stuart             :  Ill try Vaders Personal Shuttle.<br/>
Everyone           :  Merry Christmas and a happy new year.<br/>
