<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">PRE TOURNEY: well we got a fairly humble number of people to this tourney, 12 in total but hey it could have been worse.Rob the Td has started doing weekly tournaments, and one week 10 different people will come, the next week, a dif. 10 and so. if they all came at once we could have a freakin, worlds or something. anyway i’m playing TDIGWATT troopers (major kick @#$% deck, only lost 1 game in 3 tournaments) and a QMC super tech varient(QMC A PLACE FOR TECH) that i had been discussing with the esteemed mr.Martin Falke(the guys a genius) , working out the bugs and teching it against the most popular and powerful DS decks out their today(ie Senate, Watto’s deck).<br/>
on with the TR:<br/>
<br/>
GAME1:LS QMC VS Clarrie Brown’s Walker Garrison deck<br/>
Ok an unusually Ds deck for sure but i was fairly comfident in QMC. clarrie started slowly deploying walkers to non BG hoth sites while i was getting goD draws, picking up Liea, han, path and WEDGe in the first draw. second turn i deploy a couple of drawn sites and draw up to 12. on his 3rd turn i lose 2 to YMSYL. next turn i deploy, flip, dive though teh force pile and pick up hyper escape so wedge is safe. from then on it is largely a damage race with me loseing 5 to YMSYL, and me draining him for 3-5.<br/>
    however celebration is working a treat and MIRAX is setting up a beautiful on the edge/off the edge double hit. wedge and farmboy luke on artoo in red5 are holding off the chimeara and bossk, eventually power pivot sees them off for good. he is playing for battle plan and i’m not. Lord Vader makes a feable attempt at EPP Han’s life but path teleports him to safety. corran horn attempted to rush a lone imperial walker, but couldn’t call his mumma in time to get back up from obi-wan and ended up getting himself TRAMPLED. Menace fades prevented the terrible WALKER GARRISON and i drained him out for the win in a fairly close game.<br/>
FW +8<br/>

GAME2:DS VS Jonny Law’s RTP<br/>
As a wise man once said, RTP defeats itself.It is the domain of fools and baboons. in possibly the shortest sanctioned game i have eva played i was set up with 2 troopers per site(thanx 2 tactical support), TIES at cloud city, bossk at bespin and dark deal on table with trooper assaults in hand just as 8D8 hit the table. poor jonny was losing cards hand over fist, faster than he could think.<br/>
sorry about the slim details except that there wasn’t any. drains in excess of 10 per turn make for real quick games. i did play several lost interrupts so the dif. is lower than you would expect.<br/>
FW +25<br/>
<br/>
GAME3:DS VS TYNG’s LS SENATE.<br/>
Tyng seems to be fond of aiming for the ’ultimate deck’. a deck that is so solid, so teched that it is prepared fro any thing.it also seems that in this attempt for the ultimate deck it requires so much RED cards that it leaves no room for characters. i monok tyng on the 2nd turn and see hes got a couple senator, EPP obi, Kal fahl’n C’ndros and a premiere xwing. hmm. i draw up looknig for  plaenty of troopers, and sufficient ships to hold the system since where thers x-wings, theres x-wing cannons.<br/>
    Tyng flips with palpy(pre old crinckly) and the liea senatop and later deploys the bird man that prevents me drawing more than 1 destiny at systems. i deploy troopers, obsidian7, DD. land the tie and move the troopers to 2 sites.his turn he does nothing.my turn i pay for B.plan and drian for 6.ha cancels one witha senator.his turn he does nothing. my turn i deploy chimeara thrawn, obsidian1,flip. ozzel joins the boat. <br/>
    tyng them deploys home one with hashh’n, KFC, xwing w/laser. battles. i play imp.command. he says ’no yo can’t draw more than one destiny’. he shoots the tie. i draw a 3 he gets 5, KFC makes mine 0. i lose ozzel. my turn i drain for 3. he loses it. i deploy lateral damage.’no’ he says and indicates hassh’n. i deploy interceptorw/ laser. battle. shoot the xwing. i draw 4 so does he. i lose tie. he loses 2-3 cards dif. then i seperate the troopers who i had moved togehter, as i have 3 trooper assaults in hand, even with his senses, thats 9 force if he wants to cancel em, cause of TINTOE. <br/>
  so in his turn down comes EPP obi, qui gon, yoxgit(??). nothing too bad i think. out trots the BEGGAR!!!!!!!!on the old shmi’s hut goes begger and he sucks up my 3 force with some crap and battles. now no TROOPER ASSAULTS cause of b.plan/DTF. i still have 5 troopers. 2 get sliced. i draw 2 he draws 3. i  lose the 2 hit +a cadet. he pretty much finishes his turn .i have 3 troopers in hand including the 2 death star troopers who add a destiny. i play tactical support and pull another 3.<br/>
    i deploy em all. battle. trooper assault. 8x4=32 + 4 from DD +CC trooper power bonus+1 ship at CC+total battle destiny= 44 power. tyng has obi and quigon. he draws uncle palpy(+3=6)) so thats 17 VS 44.them +10 cards. i drain some more. i win.<br/>
FW +17<br/>
<br/>
GAME4 QMC VS ben may’s BHBM???!!!<br/>
 ok. this one is bad. he starts Mob points. i don’t have don’t do that again and besides my start is fixed anyway. he is activating and extraordinary amount of force. i’m still setting up. down come the star destroyers. i never get celebration out cause. i never can stay put at the system. i lose on the edge off the top. i play off the edge once. basically i have the usually suspects, lleia, lando,han, pucumir, obi, running around CC desperatly trying to out drai his a$$, cause menace fades don’t work and chiraneu drains for 3 at bespin and kashyyyk. i manage to evade him with keep your eyes open and hyper escape but it eventuallu comes down to a battle involving dach&amp;melas on th eoutrider, mirax in her ship, luke in red5, wedge ina laterally damaged red1 with a cannon. he has chimeara, thrawn, 2x death squadron star destroyer and bossk. i had to pull dash from force so the power pivot when begging. he battled. i cancelled ONE of his 5s but lost alot. eventually Vader came down and broke up the pucumir drains and luke was forced to land and submitt himself to the dark side.<br/>
FL -12<br/>

GAME5 DARK DEAL VS MATT MOHL’s QMC.<br/>
<br/>
i guess you all know his deck.its been on the top 10 for weeks now(undeservingly too i might add).<br/>
i get lots of troopers and go for the quick flip.i also have a trooper assault of cause. i deploy dark deak and land the tie used to do so. he deploys a whole load a crap to cancel DD. in my turn i attempt a trooper beat down on melas and chewie by excluding malas from the battle with stunning leader, however this only allows him to PATH away chewie, inbattle.(he only had one force and first strike was down.) B.plan is hurting me. he is draining. i have chimeara, bossk and a tie, not enough to dislodge wedge, keir santage with  lasers and pivots. he then decides he wants to lose the game. <br/>
    As i sit there dumb founded, he plays a blind off the edge on wedge RSL, draws another off the edge, he curses, puts wedge in lost pile and continues to draw.(i’m not even sure off the edge can be played at a system.)<br/>
guess what happens. chimeara and ozzel, aided by imperial command battle lonely keir santage. i get power pivoted, but he loses everthing. he deployes hobbie on his xwing to cloud city sector n waits to build up a force. i reinforce ozzel with bossk and zuckuss and deploy Cloud city occupation.<br/>
now he is paying to drain for 2s and i drain for 4 and deal another 3 damage with occupation.he doesn’t take long to fold. a tight game.<br/>
FW +5<br/>
<br/>
GAME6 QMC VS MATT MOHL’s AOTBS<br/>
well this is the deck you good people of deck tech seem to idolize: MATT MOHL’S AGENTS OF THE BLACK SUN!!<br/>
please watch as this antiquated piece of jizz gets fed a big donkey d1ck (don’t worry, he knows i’m kidding, he loves it).<br/>
he starts his turn with palpatine to the guest quarters.in my turn i start looking for sites. he doesn’t pay to drain for one. i get goD draws. he moves toward the north corridor with dengar and palpy, so leia deploys for 2. i deploy wedge on ship and us squad @#$% to get farmboy luke and artooin red5. i give them a cannon. i have a path so i flip.i grab GNT from force. GOO NEE TAY+ bespin text= opponents character deploy+3 to cc sites. he is flipped so he makes me lose 2 to the blacksun objective. he deploys slave1, zuckuss and 4-lom against wedge and luke.(he later claims that i was ’hiding’ the x-wing laser under the x-wing. um.. where do you usually put it?)battle. luke shoots zuckuss. wedge calls 4-lom’s momma to tell her the bad news. i don’t cancel slave1’s destiny cause i felt sorry for him.i lost wedge. he losses slave1 to power dif. in my turn i deploy dash and mirax. i path around draining with pucumir, lando, obi etc. IG88 manages to capture han. lando shoots him with the No Questions Asked AO. celebration doesn’t come out strangly enough. OLD PALPY sits outside the north corridor having his drain cancelled, unable to move toward obi and pucumir. i start edgeing. he draws up.<br/>
FW+19<br/>
<br/>

Clarrie Brown 10+77<br/>
Me 10+62<br/>
ben may 8+50 odd<br/>
tyng 8+ 40 odd<br/>
