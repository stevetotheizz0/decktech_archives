<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Heh heh. Sorry bout that last crappy TR I wrote. Like I said, I was pissed and  wasn*t thinking straight. So, anywho-in-the-hey, here is a highly refined version of it. It doesn’t suck, so don’t give it a one star because, unlike that other un-godly piece of jank I wrote last night this doesn’t suck. Righty-o! Onto the TR.<br/>
<br/>
First off, I am playing a Dueling, Racing high destiny Hunt Down for DS, and  a whacked-out WYS for light. The WYS has mad retrieval as you will see in one of my games.<br/>
<br/>
Game one: My DS "Bad-Luck-O-Rama" vs. Alan Sagan*s PodProfit.<br/>
So, he starts Goo Nee Tay which kinda sorta sucks for me, but oh well. I plop Mara and Dr.E and P.Diddyat the AC. I stall him and draw race destiny and its a ...1. I draw a Vader when I have like 24 cards of destiny 5+ in my deck. Sucky. He deploys HotJ. Ok, so we both kinda bide our time for the first few turns, all the while the race is getting suckier and suckier for me. I finally get a Vader in my hand (after 3 are acting as race destiny) and deploy him to the AC. During the move phase I lose to my own Wattos Box with my race destinies being Vader,Maul,Site,Maul,Vader. Does that suck or what?!?! That pretty much finished the game off, with me losing to Visage for like 4 turns and my race sucking so bad. I end up drawing out so he doesnt free Han, so I get a brutacular loss. Ow.<br/>
<br/>
FL -21<br/>
0 -21<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Playing Alan. He’s a cool guy. Kicks my butt. <br/>
Lows: Drawing 4 1’s and a 0 for race when I have big desiny.<br/>
Ugly: See lows.<br/>
<br/>
Game two: vs Green Hat. Sorry man I really suck with names plus I have never met you before, sorry again.<br/>
So its my WYS with 7’s mech cycle tech vs. no obj. TIEs with pilots. He starts Kessel, drops a TIE Int. there and says go. I activate, convert his Kessel, drop Dash in his ship with an Ntruder Missile and battle the TIE. I fluke out and draw a 7. So its 13 to 0. He loses 10 after forfeiting the TIE. Next turn he deploys a cloud sector to Tatooine. After deploying 1 TIE interceptor to Tatooine and the cloud sector he says Go. I drain and play Rebel Artillery (techyness to the max) to add another loss and cycle a 7. Then I deploy someone to the Cantina and flip. Then I deploy Wdge and ship and take out the TIE at Tat. cause some extra loss. From there there were no more battles or anythng of interest, just a drain race. <br/>
<br/>
FW +31<br/>
2 +10<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Several very satisfying beatdowns.<br/>
Lows: none<br/>
Ugly: BEating on lone TIEs.<br/>
<br/>
Between Games: Hmm... lunchtime! Kevin Wan and I try to figure out where to eat by standing on the sidewalk spinning while pointing. Very entertaining for small-minded folks like me. I decide we should go across the street to Little Caesar’s pizza. But, just as we get to the crosswalk, I discover Kevin is afraid to cross the street. Pfffffft! ROFL! He take’s the verbal beating with a good laugh and then we decide to go buy some pie and sugar jazz at the bakery, but there was a huge lineup of people buying bread. So FINALLY we decide to the Golden Fish Cafe. I order egg rolls with plum sauce while Keving orders some kinda burger with fries thing. We take it back to Hyperlight. I try to eat my egg rolls cleanly; without success. I try to hide my face from the 4 inches of sprouts and egg roll fillings that are hanging from my mouth. Not pretty. Anti-pretty. OK, after eating stuff the next pairings are called. Me vs. Matt. Matt? Hmm, I think to myself he must be new, I have never seen him before... imagine my surprise when I look at my command card and realize its Matt Lush. Cool! I get to play one of the best people in the world! <br/>
<br/>
Game three: my LS Retrieve-o-Matic vs. DS Senate jazz.<br/>
So I waste the first 5 minutes of the game watching the LotR trailerm much to the annoyance of Roxanne, the TD. Then I finally remember I have a game to lose and gt to work. He sets up his senate thing (whatever senate decks do, I can’t really remember exactly) and deploys Maul to the Landing Site and moves him to the DB. Says Go. I deploy Kessel with Dash and Outrider with an Intruder Missile there and say Go. His turn he gives Maul his stick and puts more senate guys at the senate. (Forgive my ignorance I havent seen many senate decks) Oh yah, he also drained me at the DB and Sensed my Lost in the Wilderness. Sucky. My turn I drain, he cancels with that political effect, I drop Luke w/ Stick and Han w/ Gun and battle free because of Battle Plan combo. His Phantom Menace has no efect because luke not a Jedi so Luke tries to chop, misses, gets chopped by Maul, and then Han, in a very calm manner steps up beside Maul, says "Dodge this" and draws a 6, blowing a big hole in the side of Mauls pointy noggin. I draw a 4 and a 5 destiny or something and he draws enought to take out Han. Luke hangs around in my hand because he’s very Resilient and I say go. After that there were several more battles where Maul died at the hands of Invinco Luke, and I retrieved about 40 force (no kidding!) from on the edges but I still got out drained because My main drains were being cancelled. No biggy. I lose to Matt Lush. Surprise surprise =^p<br/>
<br/>
FL -8 (Yay! Only 8!)<br/>
2 +2<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Retrieving 40 force, 7 On The Edges. Never ending Lukes, 5 Jedis Resiliences. Realizing who you thought was some scrub is Matt Lush, priceless. <br/>
Lows: Ummm... my crappy attempt at humour?<br/>
Ugly: Maul being no match for some little whipper-snapper.<br/>
<br/>
Game four: Vs. Green Hat again. I feel so sucky I cant rememebr your name! Really sorry!<br/>
My DS "So far so sucky" vs. his non-obj. matching pilots thingy. My space is severely lacking in my deck so I am kinda worried, but I think I’ll be ok. I get a nice starting hand so I deploy Tat Db w/ Vader w/ Schtick there and flip. He takes Visage. His turn he deploys Home One Warr Room with some scrub there and says go. I am racing slow incase I lose some cards but I haven’t yet. I deploy Maul and Saber to Tat:DB. Say go. So now he’s taking Visage every turn and a drain of 2 each of my turns, and 11 podrace hit whenever I want it pretty much. He Deploys Alderaan and some X-wings there and says Go. I drain him and say go. Rinse, Lather and Repeat. for about 5 turns. Save the X-wings. He Saves up all his force for a bit and plays Home one at Alderaan. Bye this time he really has hardly any force left so I finish the race and drain him out in 2 more turns or something.<br/>
<br/>
FW +42<br/>
4 +44<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Only losing 1 card which was a lost interrupt of mine.<br/>
Lows: Him losing his systems to force drains and Visage.<br/>
Ugly: Luke or Ben never showed up... at all.<br/>
<br/>
Game five: Me vs. Alan Sagan again. <br/>
My Whacky WYS vs. his ISB Scum brutalness.<br/>
He has tech start grabbing Tat. System with Nemo Advisor and grabbing Nightfall with Twi’Lek. Then he deploys Chall Bekan and 3 ORS to my Cantina. Hmm... this is anti-good. But techalicious none the less. I grab Dash’s ship once again with Squassin and put him with a Int. Missile at Kessel. Weird how I got him in each of my starting hands. Then I say go. He drains me and deploys Jabba’s Palace AC with Skinny Jabba and Boelo there with Scum and Villainy. My turn I drain and play Rebel Artillery at Kessel. I drop Han w/ Gun and Melas at the Cantina, shoot Chall, he ends up losing Chall and 2 other ORS. I just forfet Han. His turn he drops some aliens (cant rememeber what) and battles Chall. I lose Melas but I clean out the site. Not a heck of a lot happens rest of the game, he starts cancelling my drains at Kessel with Den of thieves and I am tired so I kinda flop out. <br/>
<br/>
FL -23<br/>
4 +19<br/>
<br/>
Highs: That tech settup of his.<br/>
Lows: None.<br/>
Ugly: None.<br/>
<br/>
Game six: my DS vs. (DAMNIT sorry I cant remember your name either! I will appologize next tourney!) My ds vs. his MWYHL weird thing with no testing.<br/>
So he doesnt get out a Podracer so I take my time racing. I get Vader w/ Saber out to the Tatooine DB and say Go. He puts Yoda at Yodas Hut and says go. I play Maul w/ Saber at DB and say go. He Puts Jedi Luke and Premier Obi at Endor DB and gives them both their Sabers. I have a focussed attack in my hand and a really high destiny deck so I drain at the DB and then yoink Vader into my hand and draw. I get a Tarkin! Cool! So he drains me, we are both taking Visage damage. He says Go. So I drop Vader and Tarkin, start a fight, Duel Luke, He draws 5 and 4. I draw 6,4,6. Also I will win the Podrace this move phase. Luke crosses, he loses 6, and the battle continues. Obi gets sliced and diced. I cancel his battle destiny. i draw a tracked Visage of the Emperor. He take a bunch of damagem and the podrace finishes him off. I barely have enough to pay for  the retrieval. Actually it was Visage that took him out.<br/>
<br/>
FW +25<br/>
6 +44<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Crossing Luke<br/>
Lows: Forgetting your name. (sorry!)<br/>
Ugly: The beating an old man got from his students.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so that’s that! I think the top 2 finishers were Alan and Matt. Not sure, I was in the other room when it got called out. <br/>
<br/>
