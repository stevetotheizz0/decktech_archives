<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is the first part of my Tournament Report...instead of<br/>
making it 7 pages long I've decided to post it in two pieces<br/>
and expand on it here and there. This also refers to the <br/>
song by Orgy and the laughs and fun I had this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Well I had been looking forward to the March 4th Florida Grand<br/>
Slam since Neal Razi and David Akers mentioned it at a little<br/>
card party I had in late January. I had been playtesting decks<br/>
off and on for awhile trying to come up with fun combonations<br/>
and good decks. Dark Side was like anything I picked up worked<br/>
-- ROps , HDADTJ , Courts , even ISB , etc...so the problem I<br/>
had was finding a Lightside and I waited until the night before<br/>
to mess around with it and finalize my thoughts. Merritt Island<br/>
was a nice 1 hour and 40 minute cruise from my hometown of Jupiter<br/>
at 80 mph. My crew this time was Daniel Blackford and Lee Edwards.<br/>
From what I had been advertising and hearing there was gonna be a <br/>
lot of high ratings there and a lot of good players there.<br/>
Anyway on to the deck intro : Nine Inch Nails was what I <br/>
played on the way to the 'Slam so I figured these titles <br/>
corrolated to my decks pretty well. <br/>
<br/>
LS - 'The Fragile' - Hidden Base Mains...Beatdown and misc.<br/>
stuff that I wanted to try out. <br/>
<br/>
DS - 'The Wretched' - Switched name of Musician deck...wanted<br/>
to make it more menacing. <br/>
<br/>
The tournament was run by Squadron Members Charles Lund and <br/>
Mitchell Velasco and was run very smoothly. <br/>
<br/>
Before the tournament I went out to lunch with Mitchell Velasco<br/>
who is my buddy and I haven't seen in TWO YEARS along with<br/>
Dan Blackfordtalking about decks and stuff which was pretty<br/>
cool because at these big tournaments you want to say hello<br/>
to people you haven't seen and sometimes there isn't enough<br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : ' The Fragile ' versus Andreas S-'s Endor Operations...<br/>
<br/>
Start : Me - Hidden Base stuff and get Wise Advice. HIM- Endor<br/>
Ops stuff plus Any Methods Necessary for Death Star Prison and<br/>
some stuff I can't remember ( didn't matter ). He deploys Ephant <br/>
Mon to the Bunker first turn and draws. We both draw like crazy. <br/>
I spit out Systems here and there to control his activation. He <br/>
deploys M'kae on the Devastator at Kiffex with a Tractor Beam.<br/>
I make a huge mistake that costs me the game. For some reason I don't <br/>
get Draw Their Fire... I attack with Millenium Falcon , EPP Leia ,<br/>
Cpn Han , Jereon Webb and Tantive 4...he plays the tractor beam junk <br/>
to capture my Falcon . WTF ? Duh... anyway I draw my tracked 5 to blow <br/>
his stuff up ( and captured loaded Falcon in the process ) ... this<br/>
was huge because I would've smacked up Dev and played Legendary <br/>
Starfighter and he'd been hurting badly from that but I didn't so <br/>
I don't. I put down Obi-Wan Kenobi w/ Tawss Khaa at the Docking Bay<br/>
and deploy Battle Plan to try to slow him down. I also play Descent<br/>
Into the Dark and Catch most of his Senses and Alters while he is <br/>
setting up destinies with Terminal and my Dark , ugh. The sickest thing <br/>
was we both had like 30 card hands but whereas his deck would've really <br/>
been crippled by Grimtaash mine would've had no problem with Monnok. Anyway<br/>
Super Falcon comes back out and destroys stuff while I try to Few Manuevers , <br/>
Frozen Assets , and Draw Their Fire my way around Tractor Beams. He gets in a<br/>
few good drains with Endor Ops and he catches It Could Be Worse. He also catches<br/>
my On the Edges. He also Sensed them once or twice for bad recycling. Basically <br/>
he brings down EPP Vader , Mara Jade with Stick , and Tarkin to smack Obi and<br/>
Tawss and I lose 8 after them. That was basically game. Loss by 16. <br/>
Record : 0 ( -16 ) <br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Nothing really<br/>
Lowlights : Playing dumb<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : ' The Wretched ' v. Ira Myers Harvest-ish deck...<br/>
<br/>
Start : CotV with Surface Defense . Him : Mos Eisley and CP for Farm.<br/>
<br/>
Well this game also starts out pretty slow too. I start deploying stuff<br/>
to fortify the Audience Chamber. He deploys the Harvest setup<br/>
to the Farm very quickly and after he has 4 cards in lost <br/>
Pile he plays a Harvest... I Hell to Pay it. After getting<br/>
a sizeable force at the Audience Chamber I decide to tempt a <br/>
Nabrun and he Quite A Mercs it. I drop EJP Dengar ( heheheh - sorry ) ,<br/>
Lyn Me , Sy Snootles , and a few heavy hitters out to battle<br/>
the Harvest Crew. Scum and Villiany is up and I start launching<br/>
an all out campaign on the Tatooine Landscape. Dengar caps <br/>
Owen and Beru , Mara Jade w/ her stick finds that Ben Kenobi<br/>
has a certain kind of magnetism to him-- a Blaster Deflection<br/>
of some sort. So I drop the Harvest crew -- he played another<br/>
Harvest to add Battle Destinies but I forfeited out the wazoo.<br/>
Next turn I get 4-LOM down there and cancel Ben for a turn or<br/>
two at most  ( Put That Down and Blaster Deflections ! ) which<br/>
is enough to send his characters running to Mos Eisley. A Musician<br/>
herd shows up and out powers the Harvest Crew 27 to 3. All of them<br/>
die and he loses 3 after that. I lose a few guys here and there but<br/>
when he tries to jump me he can't match my power. Leia and Orrimarko<br/>
tried to defend the Farm but Brangus , 4-LOM , and the phasing Jabba<br/>
( I say that because I deployed him probably like 5 times ) ...come <br/>
to the farm and get rid of Leia. Orrimarko can only run the next site<br/>
 over. He puts out Tawss Khaa to the Sarlaac pit and is done.<br/>
Elis seals it. Win by 22 . Record : 2 ( +6 )<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : This was an Excellent Game...battling all the <br/>
way through...very tough played.<br/>
Lowlights : This is but a SCRATCH of the actually little <br/>
nuases that were happening , I wish I had this game on video<br/>
tape because I would probably watch it over and over again. <br/>
The recycling Jabba thing was kinda sick though...but only <br/>
Jabba can recycle so much ... Luke can recycle better ;) <br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : 'The Fragile' v. Ira Myers ROps deck..<br/>
<br/>
I start everything and Battle Plan. He starts Ralltiir Ops<br/>
and is puzzled as to what to start so he doesn't start anything.<br/>
He gets Dagobah Cave out and the sites. I drop 2 systems from <br/>
hand , 1 from reserve , and a Dagobah Site from Reserve. BANG !<br/>
Turn 2 I'm activating 13 Force and am pumped. He flips pretty <br/>
early. I save up and Tunnel Vision...and Tunnel Vision. He deploys<br/>
CBHYBC and Bad Feeling Have I. So my first main(s) force is Obi <br/>
and Luke w/ Gift of the Mentor. 'Imperial Barrier you say ? Uh..<br/>
..Skywalkers...to cancel Barrier , that cancels Barrier ...yep' <br/>
... I battle DTF , he reacts a  walker over , I hit Cabbel or <br/>
someone like that and clear the site with attrition...this <br/>
would be somewhat of a recurring theme. He has his objective flipped<br/>
and is basically pumping all his force towards being able to draw <br/>
destiny at all his Ralltiir Locations. I keep tossing Luke and Obi to <br/>
knock out something and draw destiny...Tunnel Vision , wash , rinse , <br/>
repeat. Then I decide I need to start retrieving my mains back so I put<br/>
EPP Leia on the Spiral at Rendezvous Point and move it to Tatooine  , <br/>
play Descent Into the Dark , A Few Manuevers on Vader's Shuttle , <br/>
On The Edge for 4 , He grabs my On the Edge , and I pay 2 to play <br/>
On the Edge again...get back 3 more including mains that I needed. <br/>
He attacks my EPP Leia on Spiral with Zuckuss but draws a bad destiny<br/>
( Even with ROps ) so the Spiral Lives !  Zuckuss must be choking on <br/>
his ammonia based atmosphere because here comes Captain Han , Jereon <br/>
Webb , and the Millenium Falcon to help the Spiral. Battle <br/>
commences I draw my 2 Tracked Destinies...Boom boom...Zuckuss<br/>
in Hunter goes down along with 4 more... Spiral goes down...<br/>
Legendary Starfighter HAS LANDED! Aooooga ! Aoooga ! Attention<br/>
Imperial Fleet : Captain Han Solo has said you must destroy his<br/>
ship or it will destroy you.  The Navy makes a few more attempts<br/>
but tracked destinies attrition them down. Obi makes yet ANOTHER <br/>
APPEARANCE on Ralltiir for 9 force and takes out Tarkin. The Navy<br/>
knocks Captain Han Solo out but it appears he was only below deck<br/>
perhaps paranoid of Lateral Damage. Tracked Destinies and more ships<br/>
blow up. So the way it stands now I have Hidden Base Flipped...I <br/>
control Tatooine and he is at Bothawui and Corulag along with 2 <br/>
Ralltiir Sites. I have EPP Leia at his Forest after Obi sucked up<br/>
the attrition. So it is Swamp ( Vader ) - Forest ( Leia ) - and <br/>
Prefect Office ( Tempest 4 ). On my turn I activate and play....<br/>
can you feel it...can you ...can you  possibly guess ? <br/>
Tunnel Vision. And I can't help but laugh a sinister and menacing<br/>
laugh as I take my card into hand from Active Force. I pay 9 Force<br/>
for EPP Luke for at least the 8th time this game. Battle...Knock <br/>
off the Walker... Move Leia away from Vader ( who moved to Leia's<br/>
site on his turn ) and Flipped Ralltiir Ops back ! It took me about<br/>
12 Obi/Luke Strikes to do it but I did it...Grand Slam Home Run Baby...<br/>
now he's in trouble.  I'm draining for only 3 but I have DTF out , he's<br/>
losing 2 for Legendary Starfighter and Hidden Base is providing the force<br/>
choke to mess him over. This choke is on the mark and finishes him off. <br/>
Win by 12. Record : 4 ( +18 ) <br/>
<br/>
Highlights : heh... I can't help but sit back and have fun<br/>
with Ira. He is such a funny guy and a good guy to play versus. I really<br/>
didn't expect our games to be such slugfests and I thought he had the <br/>
upper hand in this one...I mean whatever I threw at him he just had more<br/>
ability 4 combos to get objective enhanced Destiny. I think I snatched this<br/>
win out from under him. <br/>
<br/>
Lowlights : Having to play him again...at least I invited <br/>
him over to have some recompense for the nastyness I did to him.<br/>
<br/>
Coming in Part 2 : Games versus Decktech Citizens : Leonard<br/>
Mitchell , Hugh Shelton , and CLINT HAYS ! Along with the<br/>
wrapup stuff. <br/>
