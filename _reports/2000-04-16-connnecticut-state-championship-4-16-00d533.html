<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, Andy Klema here to tell you all about the CT states. I made the 45 minute drive with my friend Cody DiCara and got there around 8:15. Since the tournament didn't start until 9:00, we had time to fill out decklists and trade for cards we needed. My decks were Conn H&amp;R, my version of TJ Holman's Hit and Run deck (revised version will be up soon), and DS was Pure Rumors Space, my usual deck since nothing I made before states seemed to work out that good. If you want decklists, visit my page or message me. Anyway, on to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS vs Tom Hollington's HuntDown<br/>
	Good, HuntDown. 3 Trans Terms in my deck, Bouush, dueling interrupts, I wasn't worried about this at all. It look me a while to cancel Visage, but he wasn't doing anything in the meantime. I killed the first Vader he put out with EPP Luke and EPP Leia. He tried to duel, but I canceled with Run Luke, Run (TECH). He spread out on some docking bays, and I just kept going after him with recurring mains (Bacta Tank was out). Anger Fears were doing their work, as was Draw Their Fire. He put out Nal Hutta, but never put anyone there, so I didn't get to use my Leaders. Oh well. A little retriving with On the Edge, and a final beatdown on Commander Igar put the game away.<br/>
FW (+32)<br/>
2 (+32)<br/>
<br/>
An easy game, but that big differential was going to put me up against a good player. And here goes...<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS vs Greg West's Yavin 4 Mains<br/>
	First thing I say to him ' Way to be original.' He shrugs and says there's a few tricks in there. I didn't see any, but he still claims there were. Anyway, Greg's a damn good player, and we always have good games, but he outplayed me in this one. He piled on my Endor sites very early in the game, so I couldn't get Rumors going well. I had a drain for awhile, but he clawed it. Next card that goes off the top to a drain, Those Rebels Won't Escape Us. Yippee. Anyway, I tried to beat on Obi with Vader and Tarkin, but Obi survived and came back to beat on Vader with Luke. I knew it was coming but I couldn't do anything about it. He swung, hit Vader, played Gift of the Mentor, and pulled about 12 total in destiny. Vader and 12 please. That was game right there. I got in some Rumors boosted drains toward the end, but the Super Falcon blocked most of them, and I suicide attack the Super Falcon with Dengar in Punishing One to cause some extra force loss (Draw Their Fire and First Strike were out) and end the game. <br/>
FL (-22?)<br/>
2 (+10)<br/>
<br/>
Well, that sucked, but I should have a decent matchup in the third game. <br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS vs Dan Adamczyk's Speeder Ops<br/>
	Let's get this straight; Rumors kills Ops. Start Battle Order, Twi'lek for Imperial Decree, run some ground interference, and that's game. Let's get another thing straight; Dan is a very good player, and I'm not trying to play his skill down, but I got shafted in this game. Opening draw is two ships, two pilots, and crap. NO systems. I deploy Rumors and draw up 5. Still no ground characters, still no systems. So, for most of the game, I'm activating around 8-9 force, not nearly enough for Big Blue to work on. He's smart and starts the Fat Lady to protect from Monnok (last time we played, I Monnok'd him twice for about 15 cards). I play really stupid as well during this game. I toss Blast Door Controls to a drain, and later come down with Vader + Tarkin. Barrier. Doh! Well, I knew the game was over, just look at some of the stuff I lost off the top early in the game: 2 Lateral Damages, 2 Twi'leks, Imperial Decree, Mara, Those Rebels Won't Escape Us (again!). This just wasn't my game. <br/>
FL (-24)<br/>
2 (-14)<br/>
<br/>
So I'm really sucking right now, but I decide that I will pull it out, and win my last 3 games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS vs Charlie Hoffman's Hoth Deck<br/>
	I wonder why the heck he's playing Hoth, but it was basically Big Blue with Rebel Base Occupation. He puts Vader alone at the Defensive Perimeter. I don't Signal for Draw Their Fire in earlier turns, and deploy EPP Leia and EPP Luke (sound familiar). Battle, hit Vader, Skywalkers, Vader and 9 please. Ghhhk. Damn! Then he puts Much Anger in Him and Responsibility of Command on Luke (TECH), and drops Ozzel in front of him. He hits me for 12 force before I can cancel it. The rest of the game is me chasing around his guys and retrieving some force with On the Edge and Draw Their Fire. Still, that old school combo and some occasional drains got to me since I was only draining for 1 at the holotable (only had 1 Projection of a Skywalker out), so he got me down to 18 force before it was over. <br/>
FW (+18)<br/>
4 (+4)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I still suck, but I'm starting my comeback.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: DS vs Jeremy Daillere's Profit<br/>
	I don't like playing Profit with my Rumors because I dont' have an exceptional amount of groundpower, but I do have cool tricks like Death Mark and ECC IG-88. He flips on the second turn, and starts to get in some serious damage with Boussh + Anakin's Lightsaber + Lightsaber Proficiency. I get Ephant Mon to the Bunker though, and set up in space somewhat quick. I get out battle order, and he deploys a lone Gold Leader to Kiffex with no force saved. Riiiiight. Executor, Lt. Cabbel, Lateral Damage, Gold Leader and 17 please. That was basically game. I came down with EPP Vader to assassinate Han later in the game. I lose some force from it because he plays I Know and draws great destiny, but his objective stays flipped and he can't do anything to hurt me. I drain him out in space.<br/>
FW (+14)<br/>
6 (+18)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I said that I would come back, and I did. I need one more game to put myself at 4-2 and get a decent spot. <br/>
<br/>
Game 6: LS vs Frank Conaci's ROps<br/>
	Great, the matchup I didn't want. Of course he starts Bad Feeling Have I, so I have to deal with ultra-high deploy costs for the rest of the game. He draws no sites though, and I get out a bunch of 2/0 sites to somewhat choke him. I also set up a quick drain of 2 at the Hologameboard and start inserting. Of course he Monnoks me lost and catches 2 Signals and 3 AFAs. That really slowed me down, but I ended up getting out all the necessary effects anyway. I didn't insert much, but the few I did, did their damage. After awhile, I started recirculating both mains and ships with Bacta Tank and Docking and Repair Facilities. Draw Their Fire was out, as was Battle Plan and Wars Not Make One Great. He could barely drain, and I just kept retrieving and causing force loss. He held Kiffex with Zuckuss in Mist Hunter, but I just offset the loss by initiating almost every turn. A good game, but ultimately mine pretty easily.<br/>
FW (+22)<br/>
8 (+40)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I come back like I said I would, but I get crap for diff. Steve Brentson takes first (big surprise) and Greg West takes second. I take 5th, and do pretty decent, despite playing with a dark deck that I didn't feel confident in. The final standings looked like this;<br/>
<br/>
1. Steve Brentson<br/>
2. Greg West<br/>
3. Gregory Forester<br/>
4. Dan Adamczyk<br/>
5. Andy Klema<br/>
<br/>
9. Cody DiCara<br/>
<br/>
I had a great time, traded for everything I needed, and met some great people. I'll see any fellow Kashyyyk players at the regional and good luck to all of you at your states. Later. </font></td>
