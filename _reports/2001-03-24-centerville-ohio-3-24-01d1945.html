<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After going 4-2 at my last tournamnet, I wanted to change <br/>
my decks a little bit.  I decided on My Kind Of Scum with<br/>
Skrilling swarm for dark.  For light, I played Quiet <br/>
Mining Colony, with interrupts that avoid battling.  This<br/>
would be my first tournament away from home.  There were<br/>
only eight players there, that is a bad turnout considering<br/>
three players came from Cincinnati.  We all came together.<br/>
it was me, Matt Scott, and Albert(AJ) Klein<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My dark vs. Gary Blackburn (1583) WYS space<br/>
I start Well Guarded, No Bargin, TINT/Opp Enforcement,<br/>
and Power of the Hutt.  He goes with Squad Assignments,<br/>
Scrambled Transmission, and Your Insight Serves you well.  <br/>
My first turn I deploy Chamber, Jabba, and Scum.  I use <br/>
Power to take Bib.  I draw the rest.  His turn he deploys<br/>
Kessel and Artoo in Red 5 with Farm Boy aboard.  My turn I<br/>
deploy Lower Passages, with Ephant Mon there.  I also deploy<br/>
Pore Snitkin and Galid to Chamber.  I deploy a skrilling to<br/>
Jabba’s Palace and flip.  I deploy Den of Thieves, which <br/>
was very usefull.  I move the skrilling to the Lower <br/>
Passages to join Ephant Mon.  His turn he drains, I cancel<br/>
it.  He searches for Corellia and deploys Mirax on the <br/>
Skate.  He draws the rest.  My turn I drain for 4 and deploy<br/>
the Sail Barge to Jabba’s Palace with a Merc. Pilot aboard.<br/>
I draw and get Zuckuss and IG-88 in their ships.  Next turn<br/>
he drains, then flips with Han and Chewie aboard the Falcon<br/>
to Kessel.  He deploys Dash in Outrider to Corellia.  Next<br/>
turn isn’t the time to go to space.  My turn I drain for 6,<br/>
deploy Search and Destroy, he would lose one for that the <br/>
whole game. I save up.  He drains, I cancel the 3 at <br/>
Kessel.  He deploys LEEBO on the Outrider and moves Artoo <br/>
and Luke to Tatooine.  I drain for 6 and then attack.  I <br/>
deploy my ships, and battle.  I draw Wounded Wookie, and<br/>
a skrilling.  My 22 to his 8.  He loses them to cover it.<br/>
I let him go.  He drains, I cancel and lose one.  He plays <br/>
A Few Maneuvers and moves the Falcon to Corellia.  My turn<br/>
I drain him for 8.  He’s almost done.  I move Zuckuss and<br/>
IG-88 to Kessel.  His turn he deploys Kessel Run and <br/>
targets the Falcon.  He plays A Few Maneuvers and moves it<br/>
to Kessel.  My turn I drain, and play Set For Stun on Han.<br/>
It works.  So I battle and draw two skrillings.  He loses<br/>
them both.  That’s pretty much the game.  I retrieve my lost<br/>
pile with Abyssin Ornamnet and drain him out to finish the<br/>
game.  <br/>
FW: 2(21)<br/>
He never challenged me on the ground.  I had many effects <br/>
on the table, soi didn’t win by that much.  It was a good<br/>
game for me.  I didn’t expect to see a deck like that.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My light vs. Adam Reidy (1437) Bring Him Before Me<br/>
I start Battle Plan, Do, or Do Not &amp; Wise Advice, and <br/>
Squad Assignments.  He doesn’t start anything.  His first<br/>
turn he deploys Emporer and Emporer’s Power.  My turn I <br/>
search for Cloud City and deploy West Gallery from my hand.<br/>
I draw the rest.  On his turn he deploys Overseeing It<br/>
Personaly (WTF?).  He draws his force.  My turn I get the <br/>
North Corridor and deploy Princess Leia to the Guest <br/>
Quarters.  I also deploy Corran to the Corridor.  I draw.<br/>
He deploys Lord Vader to Corran’s site and battles.  I play<br/>
Dodge to move to the West Gallery.  On my turn I deploy<br/>
Carbonite Chamber and Luke w/ Saber there.  I use Squad<br/>
Assin. to get the Outrider and deploy it and Dash to Cloud<br/>
City.  I move over Corran to Vader’s site and the Outrider<br/>
to Bespin.  On his turn I play Path of Least Resistance <br/>
during his deploy phase.  He moves over to the chamber <br/>
and takes Luke.  I drain for 3 and deploy Anakin’s <br/>
Lightsaber on Leia.  I get the Falcon to Bespin and <br/>
Celebration out.  I deploy Mennace Fades, Order to Engage,<br/>
and Aim High.  I move over to Vader’s site with Corran.  <br/>
He deploys Snoova and Mara Jade to the Guest Quarters.  He<br/>
battles at Vader’s site.  I play Narrow Escape and move to <br/>
Lower Corridor.  Next, he battles Leia.  I fire and hit<br/>
Snoova.  I draw a 4 and he draws a 5.  I lose Leia and he<br/>
loses both.  Next turn, I retrieve and deploy Obi-Wan w/<br/>
Lightsaber.  I play Off the Edge and retrieve 5 with a <br/>
tracked I’ll Take the Leader.  His turn he drains, I cancel<br/>
it with the text of the Lower Corridor.  It goes on like<br/>
that for a couple of more turns.  I win with no lost pile.<br/>
FW: 4(52)<br/>
Again, I deploy a lot of cards.  I’ll have to learn not to <br/>
do that.  My interrupts were too much for him.  Cloud City<br/>
Celebration is cool.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My light vs. AJ Klein (1588) MKOS alien mains<br/>
AJ came up with us.  He knows my deck and I know his.  I  <br/>
start Squad Assin, DODN/WA, and Battle Plan.  He starts <br/>
No Bargin, Power, and TINT/Opp. Enforcement. His first <br/>
turn he deploys Mighty Jabba and Galid at the Chamber <br/>
and draws.  My turn I deploy Cloud City from my hand and <br/>
search for Carbonite Chamber and Leia to the Guest Quarters.  <br/>
I let him go.  He  drains and deploys Ephant Mon to the <br/>
Chamber and Chall Bekan to the Lower Passages and searches <br/>
for an abyssin.  He flips his objective.  On my turn I <br/>
drain for one and he loses the Sail Barge.  I deploy the <br/>
Lower Corridor and Red 4 with Hobbie piloting to Cloud City.  <br/>
I deploy Luke w/ Saber to the Corridor.  I flip my <br/>
objective.  I deploy han in Falcon to Bespin.I draw Lando <br/>
w/ Gun, Melas, and Twass Khaa.  He deploys Boba Fett w/ Gun<br/>
and an abyssin to Jabba’s Palace, Myo to the Chamber.  On <br/>
my turn I deploy Celebration and play Off the Edge and <br/>
target Luke.  Being the dumb @$$ I am, I mistrack and draw <br/>
a one.  Luke dies.  Mennace Fades comes down.  I get down <br/>
Obi with Lightsaber to the Corridor.  He deploys IG-88 <br/>
with Riot Gun to the site with Leia, but he doesn’t battle <br/>
me.  He lets me go.  I try Off the Edge again and target <br/>
Obi-Wan.  I track right this time and retrieve 4.  I <br/>
retrieve again with Celebration.  I deploy Lando, Melas, <br/>
and Twass Khaa to Jabba’s Palace.  I battle and hit Boba <br/>
Fett.  I play the lost part of Sorry About the Mess &amp; <br/>
Blaster Profincey.  He is in trouble now.  I draw a 5.  <br/>
My power is 13 and his is 2.  He loses 9 off the top.  AJ <br/>
is almost done.  On his turn he doesn’t drain (Battle Plan)<br/>
and instead deploys Bossk in Hound’s Tooth to Cloud City.  <br/>
He lets me go.  I drain, celebrate, and move Han to Cloud <br/>
City.  He has about 5 left.  He battles retrieves 2, draws <br/>
a 4.  I draw a 3.  I lose two and he lets me go.  I play Off<br/>
the Edge, target Obi-Wan, and retrieve 3.  I celebrate to<br/>
retrieve my lost pile and drain.  On his turn he draws up.<br/>
FW: 6(81)<br/>
I had another good game with my light side.  He couldn’t <br/>
seem to find a grabber to grab Off the Edge.  AJ just got<br/>
back in, so he forgets stuff sometimes, but I have a feeling<br/>
he will do a lot better.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My dark vs. Adam Reily (1437) Drain on Endor<br/>
I started the usual: Well Guarded, No Bargin, TINT/Opp Enf, <br/>
and Power of the Hutt.  He goes with Rebel Landing Sight, <br/>
and uses Careful Planning to get the Hidden Forest Trail.<br/>
My turn I deploy Chamber, Jabba, Scum, and Boelo.  I draw <br/>
my last cards.  He deploys LSJK, Luke’s Lightsaber, <br/>
Lightsaber Profincey, Daughter, and Anakin’s Saber.  I’m <br/>
thinking how the hell could he get all those cards even <br/>
when I cut!?!?  He lets me go.  I deploy Den of Thieves <br/>
(Thank the maker for this card).  I deploy Bib to Lower<br/>
Passages and a skrilling to Jabba’s Palace to flip my<br/>
objective.  I deploy Galid to Chamber.  I move over the <br/>
skrilling to the Passages.  On his turn, he drains, I use<br/>
Den of Thieves to cancel it.  He deploys Merc. Armor on<br/>
Leia and Luke.  He draws and lets me go.  I’m thinking I’d<br/>
better attack before more stuff comes.  I deploy 8 <br/>
skrillings and battle.  He hits two of them and plays <br/>
Skywalkers.  I play Wounded Wookie to cancel Luke’s text.  <br/>
His draws are 5, 3, and 3.  I cancel the 5 with Pote.  I<br/>
draw Wounded Wookie.  He loses Daughter, I steal the armor,<br/>
and I lose three skrillings.  I move over to the Hidden <br/>
Trail.  He drains, I cancel, and deploys General Solo and <br/>
Chewie of Kashyyyk to the Hidden Trail.  I play Set For Stun<br/>
and get Chewie.  He moves over Luke.  On my turn I drain for<br/>
4, retrieve a skrilling, and deploy the Sail Barge with a <br/>
Merc. Pilot aboard it to Jabba’s Palace.  I deploy one more<br/>
skrilling, now 5, and move away.  He deploys Obi-Wan Kenobi,<br/>
and makes a huge mistake.  He could of battled, moved away a<br/>
skrilling to the Landing Site, and beat my @$$, but he <br/>
didn’t.  I’m really lucky.  He deploys Chewie again and <br/>
moves everyone over.  I drain for 6, retrieve a skrilling, <br/>
and run away to the Landing Site.  The game goes on like <br/>
this for awhile, but he finaly draws up.  <br/>
FW: 8(99)<br/>
I got really lucky when he didn’t battle with Obi-Wan.  I <br/>
could of lost that game, but I pulled it out.  Den of <br/>
Thieves saved me this game, big time<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My dark vs. Dave Dalton (1907) EBO Ketwol<br/>
I start Well Guarded, TINT/Oppresive Enforcement, Power of <br/>
the Hutt, and No Bargin.  He starts Strike Planning, Aim <br/>
High, and Draw Your Fire.  I deploy the Lower Passages out<br/>
of my hand, look for the Chamber, but it wasn’t there.  So<br/>
I draw, get Jabba, Chamber, and Scum.  His turn he gets out<br/>
General Crix, uses the Signal to get A New Secret Base, and<br/>
takes the Echo Docking Bay and the War Room.  He deploys<br/>
Crix and Figirn.  He also deplos Goo Nee Tay.  My turn I <br/>
deploy Chamber, Jabba, Scum, and Bib.  I also deploy Ephant<br/>
Mon with Power of the Hutt.  On his turn he takes a docking<br/>
bay.  He deploys Artoo to Jabba’s Palace.  He signals for <br/>
Frozen Assets, I don’t like that card.  He lets me go.  I <br/>
deploy Galid, Pote and a skrilling at the Palace and 3 at<br/>
the Lower Passages, I flip.  I move over the skrilling.  On<br/>
his turn he deploys Luke with Lightsaber for seven.  He <br/>
deploys Frozen Assets.  He battles and hits Ephant.  I draw<br/>
a skrilling.  Its 12 to 8.  I lose Ephant and Jabba.  He <br/>
loses luke and tries to switch with a docking bay, but he <br/>
forgot to deploy Ketwol.  He moves over Artoo and deploys A<br/>
Gift.  That’s not cool.  On my turn I deploy Jabba and <br/>
Boelo, but being the dumb @$$ I am, I don’t deploy Hutt<br/>
Influence.  But the worst thing was, I had it in my hand.<br/>
I deploy Sail Barge with Merc. Pilot and 6 skrillings to<br/>
the North Ridge and move in.  He deploys Obi-Wan to the Chamber<br/>
and battles.  He hits Galid and draws a 3, I cancel it with <br/>
Boelo.  I draw a skrilling.  It’s 11 to 5.  He loses Obi<br/>
and switches with a docking bay.  My turn I deployed two<br/>
skrillings to the Chamber and moved my four skrillings to<br/>
the docking bay.  His turn we wager, I win.  I retrieve<br/>
Galid.  My turn I finally realize I’m an idiot, and deploy<br/>
Hutt Influence.  I deployed another 4 skrillings at the <br/>
North Ridge and moved in.  He deploys Han in Falcon at <br/>
Endor.  He also deploys Luke with Lightsaber to help out<br/>
Crix, Figirin, and Ketwol.  My turn I deploy IG-88 and <br/>
Zuckuss to kill off Han.  I draw two skrillings for battle<br/>
destiny.  It’s 21 to 6.  He lose them buth and a couple <br/>
more.  I move my second group of skrillings over and trap<br/>
him.  I draw Galid.  He battles my skrillings, I play <br/>
Wounded Wookie and cancel Luke’s text.  He loses Figirin<br/>
and I lose one skrillings.  Next turn I drain, battle Luke,<br/>
Crix, and Ketwol.  I play Wounded Wookie.  I draw a six, he<br/>
draws a three.  I lose a skrilling, he loses Ketwol.  I move<br/>
the second group of skrillings in.  He does nothing.  I <br/>
battle him and end the game.<br/>
FW:10(118)<br/>
This was a tough game.  I should read my cards next time.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My Light vs. Dave Dalton (1907) SYCFA TIES<br/>
I start the usual: Squad Assign, DODN/WA, and Battle Plan. <br/>
He starts First Strike, Moblization Points, and You Cannot<br/>
Hide Forever.  He gets Wakeelmui and activates.  He draws<br/>
up.  My first turn I deploy Cloud City and Princess Leia.  <br/>
I draw up the rest of my force.  He deploys Merreck to the<br/>
Death Star: Docking Bay.  He gets out Endor and Sullust from<br/>
his hand.  I go.  I deploy Luke with Saber to the Docking<br/>
Bay.  I also get out the Outrider with Dash and Horn <br/>
piloting to Cloud City.  I battle Merreck, slice him.  He <br/>
loses him then he gets OOC.  He deploys a Dreadnaught to<br/>
Bespin and Fighter Cover.  He puts down an Intercepter with<br/>
a cannon to Cloud City.  He battles and shoots down the <br/>
Outrider.  He lets me go.  I drain for one, than play <br/>
OOC/TT and place out of play a card.  I deploy Orrimarko to<br/>
the Carbonite Chamber and Obi-Wan to the Lower Corridor.  I<br/>
let him go.  During his turn, I play Off the Edge and <br/>
retrieve 4, but he grabs it.He deploys a TIE Interceptor<br/>
with a cannon to Endor, the same at Sullust.  He puts down<br/>
The Emporer’s Sword at the Death Star: Docking Bay.  He <br/>
deploys another Dreadnaught to Bespin.  During my turn I<br/>
deploy Hobbie in Red 4 with cannons aboard to Sullust.  I<br/>
battled and hit the Intercepter.  He deploys U-3PO to <br/>
Carbonite Chamber, but he gets Revealed.  He deploys <br/>
another TIE to the docking bay.  He battles Luke and draws<br/>
a three, to my 2.  He loses the Interceptor (no Sinear).  <br/>
I drain for 2 at Sullust and 2 at two Cloud City sites.  I<br/>
play Off the Edge and retrieve 4.  He deploys Kashyyyk with<br/>
an Interceptor and a cannon there.  He deploys U-3PO again,<br/>
but again he gets Revealed.  My turn I drain and deploy <br/>
Twass to the Death Star: Docking Bay.  I let him go.  He<br/>
drains for 8 and deploys Arica, breaks cover and battles.  <br/>
We both end up losing our characters.  I drain for 4, and<br/>
he drains for 8.  It went on like that for a couple of <br/>
more turns.  He didn’t get out Sinear the whole game.<br/>
FL: 10(113)<br/>
That game could have been a lot worse.  If he would have<br/>
found Sinear or killed Hobbie, it would have been really<br/>
ugly.<br/>
