<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After a 1.5-hour drive, my dad and me arrive at the Sheraton. He makes some telephone calls and I fill out deck lists. We are the only people in the room. People slowly pile in, and it starts at 11 am.<br/>
<br/>
 My decks: LS- Hope you learned something 2.0. Thanks to Pavlik for some tips.<br/>
           DS- A balanced space/ground deck with 2/2 imps.<br/>
<br/>
 Game 1- DS VS Rob Bowles LS mains<br/>
<br/>
 I got a good draw: 2 dreadnuaghts, a 2/0 hoth sites, and some imps. He starts hut/station. He moves obi there, with his lightsaber first turn. I draw some, and get decree and Endor. Im pumped. I eat a drain, and he puts out Savrip. I deploy more stuff.  I draw, and get walkers DlOTS Tarkin, and Masterful Move. Next turn I put down a lot of pilots/ walkers and Vader and Tarkin against Obi EPP Luke and Yoxgit. I battle, choke Yoxgit, cancel savrip. He hits Vader with a 5 and a 6 or something. I do not cancel, because he would hit anyway the next draw (he had great destiny). He plays gift of the mentor. I start to spread in space, and I take over obis hut. He deploys EPPS, and nabums to the Ice Plains, and moves Obi/Leia to the Wampa Cave. By this time im draining of 3 at the hut, 2 at Endor, and 2 at Kashyyk. I draw and get Vader, Tarkin, and a ds612. He then nabrums Luke/Han to tocsche station, and moves obi out. I go down against Leia. He plays Warriors Courage. I&amp;#8217;m thinking, ' WHO PLAYS WITH THAT??' I kill Leia, and have to lose tarkin and DS. I then block obis drain with Vader. I drain him out.<br/>
<br/>
 FW- 2(+15).<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Fun Game<br/>
Lows: 3 other DS players won by 15, so its a random shuffle.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2- My LS VS some guys annoying ISB deck.<br/>
<br/>
 He starts Arrest order. I train with relative ease. By this time, he has out some docking bays. 2 of them have generic deserts on them. Then he puts out tempest scouts at the desert with ISB pilots. He deploys Sandwhirl to both desserts. I deploy POAS on both of them. Then he deploys more ORS on tempest scouts and stuff and moves to the docking bay. Here is where I made my mistake. I deploy all my EPPS and some other guys to 1 site. If I had gone to both and tried to atrit him out, I could have flipped him back and drained more. However, being the type of guy who gets a plan and doesn&amp;#8217;t look for its flaws, I go to one site. I clear the site with Ease. I DBT to endor. Cost me 10 FORCE! 10 'bloody' force to DBT! Im mad about that. He starts spreading out and we go into an endless loop. I drain him for 1. He drains for 2. I Harc Seff 1 of it. I ICBW the other. Then he moves over and I DBT some guys over to him. If I had saved my force, and just ate 1 drain from my hand, I could have won. Im holding on to Beezer, hoping he will move 1 of his scouts and then make me battle and react. He never does. Then since I&amp;#8217;m an idiot and DBT Orrimaarko away, he sends ozzel in front of Seff. I cant do anything and he uses my DTF against me. Im so mad that I ask how much time is left and the guy says 30 seconds I just draw up and storm off. Im soooo pissed. It was the most boring game I had ever played and it gave me a mondo headache. I played dumb because of how annoying his deck was. I drew up so he didn&amp;#8217;t get a time win.<br/>
<br/>
FL- 0(-6)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: none<br/>
Lows: everything, and not playing with 1 control.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3- My LS VS- Ben Saunders HDADTJ w/ Duel TIE SCOUT deck.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 He starts POTF. After he activates, I  clash it. He kind of sits there and his jaw drops. He puts in his lost pile and keeps on activating. HE puts out kashyyk 1st turn, and deploys Vader. He doesn&amp;#8217;t say to lose to Visage. I think we did like 1 time. I set up testing. He tries to do stuff in space. I put out EPP Luke and EPP Obi to a CC site. I had used traffic control the turn before, and had a 6, 5, 5 on top deck with a courage in hand. He picks up Vader. I drain some. He deploys Vader, duels Luke w/ a focussed. I play my courage. He cant believe my destiny. He draws 2 Vader&amp;#8217;s and a system. Bye bye Vader and 9 force. Then I keep drawing the 6 and knocking out tie w/ GLinG1 w/ Wedge piloting. I clear out Kasshyyk. Then he puts out a scout and an OTSD tie against me. Im thinking, ' why is he doin this??' He battles, plays All Power and Tallon Rolls me. I draw Dont Forget the Droids. He draws like a 2. So he has to lose his ship. I then draw a 5 for destiny, and then drain him out. He had been draining in space and I lost a lot of ships top deck. I was mad about that.<br/>
<br/>
FW- 2(+11 or something)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning against Vader<br/>
Lows: Not big dif.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4- My DS VS Bruce Savins Eloms/ non unique aliens deck. <br/>
<br/>
 I start at DS with IAO. HE starts obis hut and the Audience Chamber. He goes and draws. I go deploy Kiffex and draw. Still no sign of a ship. He deploys RLinR1 and moves it. I go and draw, and get 1 ship and 1 pilot. The rest of my decent sized hand is all red cards. I eat the drain. he deploys some eloms and doesnt draw. I deploy a dreadnuaght and DS613. Battle. Then he reacts with the 2 force I didn&amp;#8217;t realize he had. Spiral. Im not worried. Then he draws a 4, and I draw a...0. Dreadnaught gets hammered for 5 force and it next turn. He has Eloms and Bomars running rampant on Tattoine with Klatooians kickin it in the Audience Chamber. I go down with DLOTS and Tarkin with some random imps in the chamber. Choke a Kdog. Lose an imp. Next turn more Eloms and I lose a ton. Im kinda annoyed. My deck couldn&amp;#8217;t stand up to the almighty Eloms.<br/>
<br/>
FL- by 26 (? ) I&amp;#8217;m so mad)<br/>
<br/>
Im thinking about dropping. At this time, my dad comes in. he had just seen Episode 1 and he enjoyed it immensely. I tell him id really like some food. He comes back with a Mcyds chicken sandwich. I tell him he&amp;#8217;s my new savior and go into game 5.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5- My DS VS some guys Testing deck.<br/>
<br/>
 Not much to say here. Im draining the whole game. Right before he flips I put out CHYBC. He puts out Melas to the 3rd marker to where some walkers and Vader/tarkin are. And GLinG1 to kiffex where I have some SDs and Dreadnaughts. I dont use reactor terminal and I beat him down easily. <br/>
<br/>
Fw- by 20. if id use my Terminal it have been 34.<br/>
<br/>
Im now at the top table. I have really bad dif though. Im thinking I can get to top 4, but I know I wont make the finals.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6- MY LS VS Alex Tennents deck like mine.<br/>
<br/>
 I train. He activates a ton. I get the falcon with Han and wedge and RLINR1 to kiffex. He put out 3 SDs and 2 pilots. Im just hoping no Lateral Damage. And there isnt one. Im relieved. He loses a pilot. I lose wedge to the tank and Red Leader. I move to the Death star. I have got Epp Luke at the CC lower corridor. He deploys DlOTS, Tarkin and Arnet. I nobel sac wedge to get back 6 needed cards. I hit arnet. I lose Luke. He has Vader and Tarkin there. I draw. Get EPP Luke, clash of sabers, EPP Obi, Tawws Khaa and beezer. He puts out POTF on kiffex and starts draining. I put out my guys, and clash Vader. Battle. Lose takin and 18 force please. Thanks for playing. I drain him out, but the drain of three really hurts alot.<br/>
<br/>
I end up at 8 (+26) What a bad dif! Im expecting like 6th or so. I get 4th!  Im happy, and I leave and dont see the final. Nick Rice got 3rd. Gary Carman and John Shields played in the final. I had fun and met more of the english players. Hope there is a worlds 2000.<br/>
