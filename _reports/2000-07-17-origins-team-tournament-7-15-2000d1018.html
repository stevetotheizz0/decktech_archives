<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">well, markley and i drove from illinois to ohio with our friend bret.  let me say first of all that OHIO is a gay-a$$ place.  some of the fast food places there close at 6pm, and NONE of the chinese places deliver!  whoa.  so anyhoo, we end up hitching a room with YJ world chump Heisler.  it's me, bret, markley, chris hunter, heisler, mike girard, and one night gabe alonso stays over as well.<br/>
<br/>
there's much drinking/card playing/general carousing to be had the entire weekend, and it's a blast.  unfortunately for me, i've discovered that the 2 tournaments that i really want to play in are on the same day.  L5R's Kotei Emperor Tournament and SWCCG open.  bummer.  so i play in the SW team tournament on friday, and then the Kotei on saturday.<br/>
<br/>
my teammates:  markley, eric olson, and greg heisler.<br/>
olson and markley are convinced that their manipulator decks are going to flatten everyone, but i disagree.  heisler...well...i don't know what to say about him.<br/>
<br/>
i'm running Court(bounty hunting/surface defense start) and Turbo Profit Drain<br/>
<br/>
game 1 DS vs. Holotable start<br/>
<br/>
he starts battle plan, so i go right for Jabba (for the extra activation).  needless to say, i'm glad resistance is on the table because he drops 3x R2-X2 and a HOLOPROJECTOR...whoa...which he uses to pull out a POS which he deploys on the table.  i'm activating quite a bit by turn 2, and decide that #s is worse than a beatdown.  i deploy ree-yees and danz borin to occupy 2 more battlegrounds.  i've got an elis in my hand + 5 force saved in case of Epp beatdown.  he's losing to S&amp;D + court damage for almost the entire game, and i never get hit for more than 2 by #s.  <br/>
<br/>
2 +25 (+25)<br/>
<br/>
game 2 LS vs. Steven Lewis' Raithal Trooper #s<br/>
<br/>
he drops 3 monkeys to a site on turn 1, i get an a$$ draw, and by turn 3 i've lost 14 cards to 2 inserts.  hmmm...what do i do?  i deploy master luke and epp leia to his one site, and beat down 4 dudes for an additional 3 damage (skywalkers).  luke stays on his planet, gets a lightsaber, and drains for 2 or 1 the rest of the game.  obi rescued han early so i only retrieved about 3 cards, but it was a good choice, since the early damage was starting to hurt him.  another insert for 6, but now i'm draining for about 7 (with occupation).  luke runs around raithal blocking drains, and chewie is hangin' by himself at Tat:JP for 1 additional damage every turn (savrip is out, so it's no risk for me).  i wait and wait for an EPP vader to come get han, but it never happens.  it's close, and i think i win by slightly more than one turn.  <br/>
<br/>
4 +33 (+8)<br/>
<br/>
game 3 DS vs. TRM<br/>
<br/>
this guy is running your typical TRM deck, and i've immediately got the advantage on him since he won't come to tatooine.  it's a long game that sees about 8 characters in the JP:dungeon by the end, and i've ended up retrieving on 2 bouties.  <br/>
<br/>
6 +56 (+23)<br/>
<br/>
game 4 LS vs. Ralltir Ops<br/>
<br/>
i flip first turn with Master/Ben + stick and start draining for 5 on turn 2.  this hurts him a bit, and i press the drain with monks and tessek on turn 2 and 3.  some at-st's come to tatooine, but they get beatdown on.  ralltir flips, and luke never finds his lightsaber.  eventually i win the drain race.<br/>
<br/>
8 +71 (+15)<br/>
<br/>
game 5 vs. matt sokol's TRM<br/>
<br/>
he doesn't deploy anything the first couple turns, but doesn't save any force either.  jabba is attacked by EPP ben, but not cut.  next turn, 4lom and Bane attack epp ben, and with the help of All wrapped up, ben is captured, 4lom dies to attrition, and ben goes to jail.  matt is pretty surprised by this, and on the following turn deploys eppLuke to the Achamber.  nabrun, ootagootasolo, and luke goes to jail.  he's pretty much impotent right now, since han and leia are his only Epps left.  han, orrimarko, and wedge go to the CC:docking bay to fulfill S&amp;D.  elis IG-88, 4lom and zuckuss there, drop Scum + first strike, retrieve 3, cancel han's text, capture orrimarko, 3 destiny smacks han for 11 more cards.  same thing next turn, but this time it's Jeroen Webb and Wedge that get captured and beat up for another 11 cards.  i haven't set up the rancor in the pit yet, and haven't drawn a trap door.  matt makes a great move by revolving the rancor pit (so i can't retrieve force), and deploys melas on the falcon at kessel.  i end up losing 3/turn for the rest of the game from that since he play out of commission and hits Fett (fett in S1 is my only ship).  there's alot of elis action and ree-yees is now draining on Yavin in addition to other gangsters draining on tatooine.  he runs me down to 10 before drawing up with no characters left to fight with.<br/>
<br/>
10 +81 (+10)<br/>
<br/>
game 6 LS vs. Dan Sokol's Huntdown Beatdown<br/>
<br/>
he gets off to a mad fast start by dropping mara and Dr.E to the Achamber, and moving them over (+ mara's stick).  his 2nd turn force gen is around 10 or more, so i'm stuck sitting in the Achamber with Ben/han/tessek/monk.  he drops 3rd and 5th markers, controlling them for decree.  i move out to Tat:JP and nabrun on my move phase to hoth (with Han+ben after retrieving about 8 force from rescuing han).<br/>
he deploys tempest 1 and igar + scout walker and random imperial mofo.  i'm losing and reviving han, plus 1 or 2 cards, while he's draining me for 3 every turn +2 for visage.  this is where my deck's advantage kicks in.  i don't need to deploy ANY other locations.  i always end games with only 10 cards on the table, while my opponents have 5x 2/0 locations with 6 effects.  we're battling back and forth on hoth, and since i've lost 3 epp hans off the top of my deck so far, i can't lost han.  i lose ben and leave han stranded on hoth.  no nabrun for the ben in my hand.  his igar draws a 2 and a 0 to smack han for only 3 more cards.  EPP vader and Mara w/stick are at Tat:JP.  i play NarShadaa to recycle a 5, and i have Gift of the Mentor in my hand.  ben comes down with master, and the 2 of them draw an 8 for total destiny (retrieving 1 from his first strike and killing both vader and mara).  he dies to his own visage at the end of his following turn.  closest game i'd had all day. <br/>
<br/>
12 +84 (+3)<br/>
<br/>
so i'm waiting for Gary Carman and Brian Terwilliger to finish their game.  gary is undefeated as well, and Brian is 4-1.  if brian wins, i'm in first.  <br/>
<br/>
ralltir vs. carman's EBO.  all i see of this game is twig holding his head with his hands.  he's got ralltir flipped, decree in effect, but only about 15 cards left.  carman is whooping him soundly, and has about 35 cards left.  whoa!  i wonder what happened here?<br/>
<br/>
so Carman takes first with team:Anglo-americans, and a differetial of about 12 +100<br/>
<br/>
i get 2nd...oh well.<br/>
my ENTIRE team scrubbed out after game 4 because manipulator gets screwed by WAYTTPOU...haha.<br/>
<br/>
what a fun day, and i enjoyed talking to everyone on An Older Code.<br/>
<br/>
correllia goes for the win the next day.  Joe Alread takes it all, beating down Melas for 20 with Kitik/Vader/Tarkin for 20....haha!!!!<br/>
