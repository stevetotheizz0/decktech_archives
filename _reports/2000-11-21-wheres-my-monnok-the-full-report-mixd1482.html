<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay, looking back after Im done writing this, this is a<br/>
long report. Settle down. Grab a beverage. All you<br/>
under-age guys, this does not mean Im encourage illegal<br/>
habits. Kick back, and enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
Intro? I heard that the St. Cloud tournament was drawing<br/>
Jon Swenson and Zach Stenerson from Moorhead and<br/>
Fargo, and I knew that Graham Neal and Mike Raveling<br/>
were going to attend from the Minneapolis / St. Paul area.<br/>
So the tournament was going to be top notch, drawing<br/>
several of the top 10 players in our region. I made plans<br/>
Tuesday, during the local 4-game tournament, with Mike<br/>
and Graham to hitch a ride out to St. Cloud and checked<br/>
back on Friday evening to confirm the plans. Once they<br/>
were solidified, I decided Id best change my decks since:<br/>
a) my light side was a pile of interrupts in the shape of a<br/>
very bad EBO deck and b) my light side was a pile of<br/>
interrupts in the shape of a very bad EBO deck.<br/>
Meanwhile, everyone and his grandma was playing Scum,<br/>
so I decided Id tear apart my Dark Side deck, too, which<br/>
was a Nikto brand of My Kind of Scum (dont mock the<br/>
Niktos, 4 power and 8 forfeit for 1 force as a react<br/>
anywhere at Jabbas Palace is pretty good). <br/>
<br/>
Fiddling around with Light Side cards and looking through<br/>
my collection, I decided that I really wanted to build a<br/>
deck using Off the Edge. But that didnt look too good, so<br/>
I built a Jedi Training to Test 6 deck. It stunk. I tore it<br/>
apart and built a Test to 3 w/docking bays and Off the<br/>
Edges deck. It stunk worse. I tore it apart and built a<br/>
TIGIH deck w/docking bays and Off the Edges. It smelled<br/>
slightly better, but still not pleasant. So, I decided I<br/>
wasnt good at building new decks, and slapped together<br/>
a Tosche Station deck, uncertain of my card mix. But it<br/>
was late and I was exhausted from my week of work and I<br/>
didnt really care about my Dark Side deck much yet<br/>
because I could build it in the car while we drove to St.<br/>
Cloud and I decided that sleep was good so I went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enter the morning. The snooze alarm was my friend for a<br/>
few taps, and I didnt have time to work on my decks<br/>
before I left to meet Graham and Mike at Grahams<br/>
house. So I grabbed my collection of cards and drove off.<br/>
At Grahams, it is made known to Mike and I that Herb<br/>
Macy will be joining us for the drive to St. Cloud (thats a<br/>
different story). And Mike reveals that he cant drive his<br/>
new BMW because it still has its racing slicks, not winter<br/>
tires, and the roads are snow-covered and icy. So, well<br/>
take my car, but, fortunately, Mike volunteers to drive so I<br/>
can work on my decks. <br/>
<br/>
I decide to call my light side good enough and work on a<br/>
dark deck. I look at a couple of the purple cards and just<br/>
get this empty feeling all throughout me. Yes, I tell<br/>
myself, these cards are so overplayed that they have lost<br/>
all meaning. What have I left, then? I ask myself. Well,<br/>
self, my self replies, how about a Jabbas Palace<br/>
Manipulator? A light goes *DING* And I start fishing out<br/>
the cards that Ill need. I grab my Tatooine, Combat<br/>
Readiness and Jabbas Palace. Thats a start. Then I<br/>
start fishing out all my 2/0 locations, Scanning Crews,<br/>
Senses, Alters, Myoom Onith, Ability x3, Search and<br/>
Destroy, Gailid, Monnoks--anything at all that I might use.<br/>
Of course, its way more than 60 cards, so I start sleeving<br/>
cards, whittling away at the pile. Remember, now, that<br/>
this is being done in half of the backseat of my car. I am,<br/>
meanwhile, entertaining the other occupants with Lords of<br/>
Acid and Ramstein. So I get to the point, shortly before<br/>
we arrive at the campus where the tournament will be,<br/>
where I have 60 dark side cards in a deck, and Im happy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, my decks are: <br/>
Light Side--Tosche Station and Mains <br/>
Dark Side--Jabbas Palace Manipulator <br/>
<br/>
It turns out Swenson and Stenerson managed to corral a<br/>
few other Moorhead players. So, with the 4 of us from<br/>
Minneapolis, a few daring folk from Iowa, the Moorhead<br/>
crew, and the locals, the tournament is populated by a<br/>
very respectable 32 individuals. Dion Erbes, the TD, has a<br/>
cold and can barely speak, but everyone quiets down<br/>
enough that we can hear the pairings as they are called. <br/>
<br/>
(I apologize for names, here. I failed to take any notes. If<br/>
you played me, you know who you are. If you didnt play<br/>
me, youre just reading about the guys, 1-6, who did.) <br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My Dark vs. Steves EBO X-wing Swarm <br/>
<br/>
As soon as I start shuffling, I realize that I didnt fit either<br/>
Battle Order or Imperial Decree into my deck, cards that<br/>
both would normally be included. Oh well, I figure that I<br/>
have two options against EBO. Either, Ill keep all his<br/>
pilots in his used pile with Screws while my early drains<br/>
and Search and Destroy will bleed his deck. OR, Ill<br/>
Monnok him for all of his X-Wings. So, we start out, and a<br/>
first turn Screw reveals 3 or so X-Wings and one rebel<br/>
who goes back to the used pile. Gailid goes to the<br/>
Audience Chamber where hell sit the whole game. He<br/>
gets his sites and draws. I Screw him again next turn and<br/>
set up another drain, so Im getting a good early lead. But<br/>
his next turn he draws up way beyond Myoom range.<br/>
Something like 17 cards. No problem. Ive activated about<br/>
14 myself. I search for something and dont find a<br/>
Monnok, so I just draw, looking for the first Monnok I can<br/>
find. And I draw. And I draw. And I draw. And then my<br/>
force pile is gone, and I still have no Monnok in my hand.<br/>
My dark side manipulator deck cant manipulate. Its a<br/>
pile. So Steve drops about 6 systems and as many<br/>
X-wings and says go. I drain for another 6 or so and hit<br/>
him with Search and Destroy. But theres nothing I can do<br/>
about his drains, so he hits me for 18 or 22. And all I can<br/>
do the next turn is deploy Zuckuss and some dude in<br/>
space to block the drain at Kessel. That buys me maybe<br/>
one turn. But its simply his huge drains versus my<br/>
modest drains and Search and Destroy. The game ends<br/>
in about 15 minutes. A full loss for me by 6. <br/>
<br/>
0(-6) <br/>
<br/>
So, after the game, I go hang out with Graham, Mike,<br/>
Jon, Zach and some of the other guys. Seems each of<br/>
them has won (until much later Shane comes back to<br/>
report a loss--to Herb Macy, but thats another story). At<br/>
any rate, I realize now that I have a manipulator deck<br/>
without Monnoks, so I say, quite honestly, that I expect<br/>
to go 0-3 with my dark and hope that my light can go 3-0.<br/>
Everyone else finishes their games, and we re-pair. <br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My Light vs Bretts (?) BHBM <br/>
<br/>
This game was fairly embarassing. My opponent barely<br/>
knew his own cards. He started the game by announcing<br/>
each card he put into play and reading the full text. I<br/>
asked him if he was doing that for his benefit or for mine,<br/>
and when he said it was for mine, I asked him to stop. So<br/>
he did. But the game had that same sort of naive feel<br/>
throughout. With Mobilization Points out, he set the<br/>
Emperor up first turn at the Throne Room, losing 2<br/>
activation. He deployed The Emperors Power but failed to<br/>
use it in two or three battles. Meanwhile, I deployed<br/>
Masta Luke first turn to Tosche Station from my reserve<br/>
deck (and he asked "How?"--so I said, "Using your<br/>
card."). And I activated a helluvalot on my second turn.<br/>
But Vader was quick to follow. We battled quite a bit and<br/>
danced around when the battling was looking bad for me.<br/>
I dont remember quite how I won, but a good deal of it<br/>
came from him losing cards from his reserve instead of<br/>
using Vaders forfeit value. I felt relieved when the game<br/>
was over. Full win by 27. <br/>
<br/>
2(+21) <br/>
<br/>
At this point, I know Im going to be among the top<br/>
players with a loss. And I hope to play my dark deck first,<br/>
so that my light side will have an easier game again.<br/>
Mike, Jon and I find an AD&amp;D video game that was kind of<br/>
fun for a while, well worth a quarter at any rate, and then<br/>
we head back for Game 3. <br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My Dark Side Misbegotten Jumble vs. Parkers<br/>
EBO <br/>
<br/>
Well, he shows early signs of X-wing Swarm, so I set up<br/>
Gailid and Myoom again at two Jabbas sites. And my<br/>
early damage holds him back for quite a bit. Parker pulls<br/>
an interesting move and Revos the War Room, but for<br/>
some reason I had put Come Here You Big Coward in my<br/>
deck and, having drawn it, slap that down the succeeding<br/>
turn. So, it turns into extra generation for me and a<br/>
generation loss for him. Quite an important turn, too,<br/>
since my Screws hold him back a bit. He gets out Echo<br/>
Garrison... or whatever the effect is that lets him pull<br/>
Commander Luke, etc. But that only gets him one<br/>
character a turn while Im draining for 4 and working him<br/>
over with Search and Destroy. At one point, he begins his<br/>
turn searching for both his Echo sites and Commander<br/>
Luke. But I had a force saved and Screwed his Luke. That<br/>
was the highpoint of the game for me. Sad, but true.<br/>
Before he gets his EBO set up, he throws some ships<br/>
into space to start draining me. But Zuckuss and Boba<br/>
Fett launch into his ships at one system, and that gives<br/>
me another drain of 1 per turn. However, the next turn, I<br/>
Myoom and find that both Leia w/Gun and Tawss Khaa<br/>
are in his hand while I have Myoom and Gailid alone at<br/>
their sites on Tatooine. Im forced to land Zuckus with<br/>
Myoom and move Fett over to Gailid, but that seems to<br/>
hold Parker off. He keeps losing force to my drains and<br/>
Search and Destroy until very late in the game. And by<br/>
that time, Vader and Mara come down to Hoth to clean<br/>
up. Full win by 27. <br/>
<br/>
4(+48) <br/>
<br/>
Well, Im pleased as punch, having won with my dark<br/>
side. So I figure I may even go 4-2. And I trust my light<br/>
side to do its job.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Tosche madness vs. Andrew Mahjowald (sp?)<br/>
RalOps<br/>
<br/>
I played Andrew before in another tournament at St. Cloud,<br/>
and I know he’s no pushover. I should beat him, but he<br/>
knows how to play his deck. When I look at my hand, though,<br/>
it seems to matter very little what he’ll do. I draw a 2/0<br/>
site, Ben Kenobi and Luke w/Saber. First turn, he activates<br/>
deploys a site from reserve and draws. My turn, I deploy<br/>
Ben at the hut, my 2/0 site and move Ben to Tosche. He goes,<br/>
deploys another site from reserve and an Imperial Guard at<br/>
the Swamp. I activate 14 or 15, deploy Battle Plan, Frozen<br/>
Assets over his saved force, Luke w/Saber against the guard<br/>
and battle. He loses the guard and 5 or 6. So he activates<br/>
about 6 force on his turn and draws. I activate and draw,<br/>
too. His next turn, he deploys the Emperor at the spaceport<br/>
site that gives +1 power and forfeit to Imperial leaders.<br/>
Okay... Since he didn’t start IAO. I deploy Frozen Assets to<br/>
shut off his force pile. Then, to Ben’s hut, I deploy Han<br/>
w/Gun, Leia w/Gun and Chewbacca. I Nabrun the 4 of them to<br/>
the Emperor’s site and beat the tar out of the old man. At<br/>
this point, the game is effectively over no matter what <br/>
Andrew chooses to do, so rather than forfeit Pasty and lose<br/>
only 15, he keeps the embodiment of evil on the table and<br/>
loses a good 24. I look at the cards in my hand and those on<br/>
the table and decide I don’t need to draw another card for<br/>
the rest of the game. I just stop him from draining me at<br/>
all and block his drains with my armada. General Calrissian<br/>
in the Falcon deployed at his &lt;&gt; DB. And I took 2 force<br/>
loss from a battle involving the Emperor, Vader a bunch of<br/>
Imperial Guards, Trooper Assault and a Dark Jedi Presence.<br/>
But I never drew another card and paid for my drains to win<br/>
by 40. And now I think I can win this tournament if all the<br/>
undefeateds knock each other off--and I pull off a miracle<br/>
win with my dark side slop.<br/>
<br/>
6(+88)<br/>
<br/>
Well, not only do I know that I can potentially win this<br/>
tournament, but so does Jon Swenson who starts *accusing* me<br/>
of throwing the first game of each tournament. I mean,<br/>
really, can I help it if I suck at first games? Righteously<br/>
offended, I tell Jon that of coure I’m not trying to throw<br/>
my games, but he should go ahead and try to backdoor a<br/>
tournament sometime... BUT the real trick is to lose the<br/>
first TWO games. No one would EVER expect that!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I believe this is the intermission wherein the<br/>
inaugural Kohman Olympics took place. Josh Kohman was making<br/>
a loud noise of himself and Mike Raveling suggested that he<br/>
and Stenerson see who can throw Kohman further. So Mike<br/>
lifts Kohman and tosses him about 3 feet. Zach, not to be<br/>
outdone, tries a new technique and hurls Kohman headlong<br/>
into a chair. Maybe 4 feet, but Kohman disqualifies him for<br/>
brutality, still reeling from the new lump on his forehead.<br/>
Later events are much gentler, including the push-Kohman-on-<br/>
a-cafeteria-tray contest...<br/>
<br/>
Well, the new pairings are favorable to me again. I play my<br/>
dark ahead of my light.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My heap vs. Justin Fleenor’s TIGIH<br/>
<br/>
It had occured to me that I could play my dark deck like a<br/>
beat-down deck and just use Screws far more than I really<br/>
should. But Justin starts Do or Do Not AND Insight. And they<br/>
never leave the table. This means effectively half of my<br/>
deck is good for nothing other than destiny and easy choices<br/>
when it comes to losing force. But I draw a Lord Vader<br/>
early and deploy him to the Landing Platform. As soon as I<br/>
can (while I’m still force-choking Justin), I move Vader<br/>
to Chirpa’s Hut and set up a drain of 2. Unfortunately, I<br/>
can’t draw a character to save my life over the next 2 or 3<br/>
turns. Meanwhile, Justin’s deploying 2/0 locations all over<br/>
the place and amassing a good handsize, and I can’t take a <br/>
peek with Screw. So I’m getting a bit worried when finally <br/>
he launches the initial assault. 2 Eloms, Chewbacca and<br/>
Admiral Ackbar. Ackbar? What the? Anyhow, that’s who comes<br/>
to battle. Fortunately, I draw a high destiny, so Vader<br/>
covers all but 3 and the one to IFTC. I start setting up on<br/>
Tatooine with Mara and Saber, Mosep, Myoom, Dr. E and maybe<br/>
some other scrub. We exchange drains until I draw a Vader.<br/>
At this point, I have enough force to a) deploy Vader, b)<br/>
Elis Helrot and battle or c) do both if I draw a 0 for<br/>
Helrot. I search for a Jabba’s location and find in my 5<br/>
force: two 0’s, one 1, and two 3’s. Why not? I play Elis<br/>
on Mara and crew before deploying. 3. Bummer. So they head<br/>
over and just sit around. Choke Lord and Saber remain in<br/>
my hand. Justin brings Ackbar back from the Bacta Tank and<br/>
battles. I lose everyone but Mara. Stack another card on<br/>
IFTC. I’ve already seen the ASP droids, so I very much fear<br/>
stacking another card on IFTC, lest he get the Catapult<br/>
down and convert Vader. At this point my drains are keeping<br/>
me in the lead. But Mara’s stuck against his big, bad crew,<br/>
holding Luke captive for 2 loss a turn unless Vader joins<br/>
her. And when has Vader ever shrunk from a battle? Vader<br/>
comes to the Landing Platform, saber in hand, and we battle.<br/>
I choke Chewbacca, hit two characters and win the battle by<br/>
1 power. Meanwhile, I’m immune, so both my characters stick<br/>
around while his are decimated. Next turn, all he can do is<br/>
run away. It’s pretty much a drain race from this point on,<br/>
except that I had managed to use Myoom once before she died<br/>
and saw an On the Edge or two in his hand. So I keep hold<br/>
of a couple of my Senses just to kill that card. Finally,<br/>
he’s down to 10 life force or less and plays his On the<br/>
Edge. Sense. I succeed and lose the Sense + 2 more. But it<br/>
was the finishing blow, and I win by 21. The dark pile<br/>
*somehow* goes 2-1.<br/>
<br/>
8(+109)<br/>
<br/>
And so it turns out, history *does* repeat itself. Jon<br/>
Swenson lost to Graham’s Scum. Graham lost to somebody. Mike<br/>
Raveling lost to somebody. Stenerson lost to Josh Kohman.<br/>
All of the undefeated players have knocked each other out of<br/>
contention except for Josh Kohman, who has a timed win and<br/>
needs to win the game to win the tournament. Meanwhile, I<br/>
have (apart from Kohman) the largest differential by far, so<br/>
the winner of our game is going to be the winner of the<br/>
tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Battle of the Joshes, Grace vs. Kohman<br/>
<br/>
My Tosche "Can I please play against Scum?" vs. Kohman’s<br/>
Scummy Court.<br/>
<br/>
He starts Court. I start Obi’s Hut, Careful Planning and<br/>
decide to convert his Audience Chamber. Of course, this is<br/>
much better than a Profit conversion because he doesn’t get<br/>
to pull a CC Engineer with Chall. Not right away, anyhow.<br/>
He activates, loses one and draws. I activate deploy Ben<br/>
to the Hut, KFC to the Chamber and move Ben over. The rest<br/>
of the game is a prolonged battle over the audience chamber<br/>
with both First Strike and Draw Their Fire hitting the<br/>
table. Many men fought bravely in the hot Tatooine suns, and<br/>
many men died. Ben was disarmed and fatally wounded, only to<br/>
recover on a later turn. Master Luke was captured, only to<br/>
be freed and wreak havoc on unsuspecting aliens. But among<br/>
the many battles, the most memorable in my mind was a fairly<br/>
humours battle between Fett w/Blaster and Dr. E against my<br/>
Luke, Ben and Chewbacca. Kohman initiated this battle and<br/>
paid to retrieve (Aim High, people--I’ve been reading your<br/>
reports, and you let people retrieve for free... that’s like<br/>
*giving* them force...). He had earlier searched for<br/>
something to find a 3 and a 6 in his deck. Well, he plays<br/>
Hidden Weapons to target Luke, and the fateful destiny is...<br/>
3. Yes, Luke is captured (where was Kashyyk? Eh, Stenerson?)<br/>
and Ben gets hit by the 6 and is E-bait. Operated and dead.<br/>
Nonetheless, Chewbacca stands his ground with no destiny,<br/>
and since Kohman had exhausted his reserve deck, he gets no<br/>
destiny either. And Chewbacca outpowers the silly evil<br/>
aliens, so Kohman goes back into the force he retrieved and<br/>
loses one. As the suns were setting on Tatooine and<br/>
protracted battles, his Projected Telepathy gets grabbed,<br/>
General Cal and Nien Numb join the fray, Scum gets<br/>
cancelled, and finally the balance of powers tips<br/>
irrevocably in the favor of the light side. Win by 16.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, Jon’s right. I’m a sneaky son of a gun, <br/>
"backdooring" yet another tournament, coming from an early<br/>
loss to claim first with a total of 10(+125).<br/>
<br/>
Zach Stenerson got second. Swenson took third. And I failed<br/>
to keep track beyond that point.<br/>
<br/>
So, cheers and jeers abound:<br/>
<br/>
Cheers:<br/>
Ben Kenobi. Do I need to say why?<br/>
Dion Erbes for running a smooth tournament, even while sick.<br/>
Players from Moorhead and Iowa for taking the drive.<br/>
The 31 players other than myself that made this a well-<br/>
attended tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Jeers:<br/>
Monnok, oh Monnok, wherefore art thou, Monnok?<br/>
This is where all those "...but that’s a different story"<br/>
references come to bear...<br/>
