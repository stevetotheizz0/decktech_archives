<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">  My first tournament in awhile, and I am using decks that I have had constructed for some time now.  End result is that they are actually well tested.  Today was filled with strange decks, I saw several Set Your Course..., an ISB, a couple Hidden Base and TDIGWATT, and some court decks as well.  Today I used HEBO(a deck that normally gets laughed at when suddenly the presumed focus switched completely) and TDIGWATT: Darkest Deal decks that can be found on my page, with a couple modifications on each.  Enough chatter, on to the report.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS HEBO  vs. Mitch TDIGWATT(non flipping I believe)<br/>
<br/>
He was sticking almost exclusively to the ground so I quickly set out all the systems I gould get my hands on.  With Rebel Fleet and Bouush I was canceling his drains through about turn 4 or 5 when the @#$% hit the fan.  He deployed his one starship of the game, Bossk in the bus.  I jumped it and did a lot of damage on differential, but didn't kill it(mistake).  The next turn he deployed Dark Deal and moved away from my ships.  On my turn I deployed my last system from reserve, the shield generators, 4th marker and an echo site from hand.   I then deployed A New Secret Base and searched for two sites, deployed them, and deployed characters to them and an X-wing from the fleet.  Bring out EBO, flip hidden base.  The next two turns I opened up my space fleet and canceled a lot of drains.  Then I made my second mistake... I forgot to force drain for a turn, for about 16 (DOH!!).  My hidden base was eventually found by the lone starship, but a kessle run with a freighter captian retrieved 10, and I won by 1.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 (+1)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Flipped and set EBO on the same turn.<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights:  forgetting to force drain... not killing the ONE starship he deployed... (a LONG list of things, but it is the first game in quite awhile)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  My TDIGWATT: Darkest Deal  vs  Brian  Harvest deck<br/>
<br/>
I get a really good opening hand and he deploys Obi's Hut and some 2/1 tat site.  Using the combination of the cloud city prison game text(get Lando) and A Real Hero(Lobot), I deploy a power of 7 ability 5 for 4 force on the first turn.  Very soon both of us have several sites out for rather massive generation, and I have moved Lando and Lobot away from the security tower.  Brian sees this as his chance so he deploys Master Luke and Wedge to them.  He attempts to send Lobot away, but fails, Lando is hit.... but I have tracked the one 7 in my deck.  Power 14 for Lando and the cyborg.  Luke is lost, Wedge stays... this is not going to be pretty.  Dark Lord, 4-LOM w/gun come down as well as another site and character, I deploy Dark Deal, Occupation and flip.  I battle Wedge and draw a rather high destiny power is +2 for alien/imperial combo, so power of about 15 before the destiny was added.  I captured Wedge with 4-LOM and fortified the defenses on the rest of Cloud City.  The rest of the game was more or less a lockdown of CC by me with the occasional battle.  In the end the force drains and occupation is too much and I drain out with 18 cards left.<br/>
<br/>
FW 4(+19)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Lando and Lobot killed Master Luke... Beating the crap out of Wedge.<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights:  Didn't get to freeze with All To Easy, couldn't find Vader's Saber<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  At the halfway point I am in uncharted waters.  Usually I bring a deck I know pretty well and a deck I am still testing so in a normal tournament I have at least one loss at this point, having played one deck that needs serious work.  There are 4 of us unbeaten right now, and my differential is the lowest of those at +19(although I should have been about +38-40).  A couple of kids I don't know had to leave as they are moving to Boston the next day, also one of our regulars has finally arived (Good luck fellas.  May the Force be with you).  We drop one of the kids outright and add in the latecommer to eliminate the bye spot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On to the action.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: my LS vs Chris, using Andy's ISB deck...  his brother(Andy) won state with that deck.  I do not think it has been beaten, yet.<br/>
<br/>
This should be interesting.  The ISB agents quickly dominate several ground locations, but I have Reble Fleet and a POAS in play, so I am not getting hurt too badly and ISB has not yet flipped to add the extra one to force drain.  I have a good opening hand with EBO, the generators and A New Secret Base all in hand as well as one Echo site.  I drew several systems early but still was not ready to flip Hidden Base when ISB flipped.  Once again I managed to flip and EBO on the same turn, this time with a few less systems than I like to have out.  Now it is a drain race, but between my high drains and the ability to cancel a couple of the beefed up drains, this is a race I am going to win.  I was ready to complete a Kessel Run and pad my differential when Chris drew up.  I get many congratulations from other participants, I have just done the impossible.  Victory to HEBO by 13.<br/>
<br/>
FW 6(+32)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  I beat Andy's ISB deck... to my knowledge that is its only loss to date.<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights:  Didn't get to complete my Kessel Run.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
we switched decks to play the final game, but since both Andy and I had played Light... top 4 play the same person, oppsite decks<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  TDIGWATT: Darkest Deal vs Chris LS Mains and adders<br/>
<br/>
Battle.  Battle.  Battle.  Battle.<br/>
I was lucky to deploy Chyler early, and kept her alive the whole time.  I am not sure how fast this deck started battling, but it did not take long.  Most of the battles involved Chris sending characters to Cloud City, normally to beat down on a single character I had deployed in the early turns to try and set up Dark Deal.  A few of the battles were one sided, fortunately that was usually my side.  Luke came to visit and disarmed Vader(bastard), but he started a fight and Vader choked him with the one good arm.  A few of the characters moved to the site with Lando and Lobot...  I got the best laugh out of destiny adders.  I dropped Mara and a Miner(fodder) and battled using the lost text of A Real Hero.  His lone character (Leia w/blaster) failed to hit anyone, didn't get an adder and drew a really low destiny.  I drew 2 miners and a 7(all tracked together).  That battle and one more on Endor:Back Door where Twas got beat up by Igar in Tempest 1(the 2 miners again for destiny) sealed the game and my largest win of the day at +30.<br/>
<br/>
FW  8  (+62)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Tracking such a great stack of destiny, keeping Chyler alive.  Choking Luke.<br/>
<br/>
 GOING UNDEFEATED for the FIRST TIME.<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights: Vader losing an arm.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I actually went undefeated.  A major first for me.  I didn't win though, Andy's differential was huge(not a surprise).  A really fun tournament though, I hope to go again soon.  I got a Tarkin in my packs too...  Now I can trade the Reflections Tarkin without reservation.  <br/>
<br/>
Congrats, Andy on a great tournament.<br/>
