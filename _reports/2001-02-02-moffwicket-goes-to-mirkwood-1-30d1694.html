<br/>
On monday night there was freezing rain and snow, which meant that there were a hell of a lot of accidents tuesday morning.  By the afternoon, it was all melted and fine, but most people were still scared s-less.  As a result, there were only 9 people at this tourney.  I left later than I usually do, and yet was the first person there by a long shot.  So I threw away $6 on a couple packs of WWF Raw Deal (funnest multiplayer game EVER).  Got a lame@$$ Disqualification! (wrestling equivilant of Flagship Ops) and the hella cool Superkick.  So the moral of the story is that the Rock is gay.<br/>
<br/>
For LS I threw together a MWYHL fakeout space deck just before I arrived.  My DS was BHBM with all the BMFs.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS space vs. Josh Grace’s ISB Ops w/tramples &amp; nevar yarnals<br/>
Josh never fails to surprise me by bringing back the dead decktypes.  When I built my space deck, I was deciding which pilots to put in, and Blount crossed my mind, but then I thought, "Naw, no one plays ISB."  D’oh.  <br/>
<br/>
My opening hand is sucky and cool all at the same time.  No systems, but I did have R2 in Red 5, Legendary, I’m on the Leader, and Darklighter Spin.  Luckily Josh puts out Rendili so my stuff doesn’t go to waste.  I deploy the hut, but Yoda’s in the force pile, so I settle for first turn Farmboy in ship.  I’m just waiting to use all my cool stuff.  Josh saves for a turn and deploys Thrawn in Chimaera.  I spin, he draws 5, 6.  D’oh!  Everything dies and I’m a little pissed.  Josh stacks a ton of power at the rendili DB and Hoth db.  I cut one drain to 1 with PoaS, and try to get undercover Han and Leia to cover the other, but they don’t last long due to NY.  He gets Vader and Mara their sabers and drains the kajabers out of me.<br/>
<br/>
FL ~15<br/>
<br/>
Highs: opening hand<br/>
Lows: Luke’s death, most of the rest of the game<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My BHBM vs. Rob Jeffery’s HB<br/>
<br/>
If you’ve read Garrett’s reports, you’ll know that Rob could be a good player if he tried harder.  He goes into some games expecting to lose, and so he does.  He gets frustrated and plays sloppily.  <br/>
<br/>
This was a battling game, so it was pretty fun.  I do the usual starting routine (I use new Empy when I have enough force).  He sets his own stuff up and forgets to give me Luke, and for once I remember to make my opponent lose 3.  After I get some guys to take Vader’s post at the Endor DB, father and son go spend some quality time in the throne room.  In space he had Dash/Outrider and Master Wedge/Red 1 together.  I save up until I deploy Big E, Ozzel, Thrawn; damage Dash, and battle.  Imp Command to add one, so I deal a ton of attrition to kill Wedge and ship.  I forget to make him stack, as I always do on the first battle.  Later I get Thrawn and Pellaeon together on the vice-flagship and move them elsewhere.  He moves almost his whole fleet to the Ex’s system.  I deploy Bossk and Zuckuss and a pilot (he had I’m on the Leader out).  He’s got massive power, but I figure I can take out quite a few people with attrition, and I won’t get hurt beside losing a ship or two, so I battle.  I draw 3 or 4 battle destinies, but my grand total is 5!  He loses no one.  He has SE pilots, and therefore greatly outpowers me.  I have to lose the Ex to cover.  I come back and beat him in a battle on the ground and one in space, remembering to make him stack, then duel Luke for the 3rd or 4th time to end it.<br/>
<br/>
This whole time Rob’s deployed 4 systems.  He asked a couple times if he could flip cuz I put Rendili out, and grumbled cuz he couldn’t.  During the last few battles and force drains he lost 2 systems!  He could have flipped long ago, but he just decided to stop deploying systems.  He said that I was sitting at his base for most of the game, but that didn’t matter.  With the obj OOP he could have drained for 3 at Kessel instead of 1. <br/>
<br/>
FW ??<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I dominated most of the game.  Drawing multiple battle destinies  (MBDs) is cool.<br/>
Lows: Could have been a lot closer.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS vs. Mike Raveling’s HD skrilling odds<br/>
<br/>
Having no idea he’s got odds, I start WA/DODN, Insight, and Squassin.  His first turn he deploys Palpy at the ExDB, and gets out Milwaukee with MobPoints.  "TIEs" I think.  I contemplate getting Aim High with Insight, but decide not to.  I do decide to get Honor.  I get Yoda at Hut.  Mike puts down a skriling, and I groan.  D’oh!  Here come the #s.  I activate and put Master Wedge in Red 1 at Kessel.  He puts out everybody’s friend, Suck@ss, and battles.  He draws a 4, so I just lose 2.  Fearing a beatdown, he runs to dagobah.  He quickly gets Battle Order and Abilityx3 out.  Over the course of the game, he plays Projective Telepathy a million times to make my Kessel drains really damn costly.  I lose to Abilityx3 when I don’t deploy, even though Honor is still effective.  He played Twilek, and I was expecting No Escape, but he got First Strike instead.  Cool.  He gets ripped apart by visage for about 10 turns until he finally gets vader to the Endor DB.  I have insanely good luck for once, as #s don’t pop until Vader’s out, greatly lessening the damage.  I get a drain going at Kiffix, and he puts No Escape down.  I have a hard time deciding what to do.  Activating between 7 and 10 and having to pay 6-8 to drain is severly hampering me.  Eventually I put suicide Luke and Orrimarko to the DB so I can drain free for once.  I don’t remember if I get to drain freely or not, but I do know they got stomped for 5 more after the forfeiting.  Mike had a brain fart and didn’t lose Vader, saving me when the second #s popped.  Boushh finally cancelled Visage (never saw my 2 OOC/TT).  I managed to drain him out after he came back from quite a deficit to make it close.<br/>
<br/>
FW ~8<br/>
<br/>
Highs: beating Mike (only the 2nd or 3rd time for me)<br/>
beating odds without any anti-odds cards (sort of)<br/>
close game that made me think hard<br/>
Wedge standing up to that big bully Zuckuss<br/>
<br/>
Lows: not many<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: BHBM vs. Herb Macy’s RTP<br/>
<br/>
D’oh!  Oh well.  Herb should really make some new decks.  He’s only played about 4 in his life.<br/>
<br/>
I started Secret Plans instead of the ususal Imp Decree.  I set up a welcoming party at the Yavin DB with Vader/Tarkin as he rescued her and moved her back with Obi as a bodyguard.  I altered bacta tank, deployed ozzel, used imp command to deploy piett, used him to deploy merrjik.  Knowing full well that someone is going to get portaled, I started the battle.  Tarkin gets squashed, Leia gets chopped, obi covers the difference and I lose just merrjik.  I forget to have him stack one.  He soon gets another Prisoner 2187 and moves her in to flip.  That little whore 8d8 brings back some deathstar plans, having tons of force to pay for it.  I move empy and janus to endor to drain while Chirnaue in Ex drains for 3 at Kiffix.  I finally figure out that Palpy can come on over and zap the second gayest droid in starwars (3po wins by a landslide).  I somehow manage to eliminate Leia for the 2nd time, after quite a few of my cards are OOP as another 8d8 is on his way back with more plans.  Herb has *exactly* enough to pay for it.  Without Liea, his drains suck as I control 2 of the 3 battleground DBs on table.  I drain for 5 or 6 a turn until he puts down a third Leia and moves her and Jedi Luke into the warroom.  I have 2 chumps in the war room and 4 force left.  On the bottom of the reserve is a 4.  On top is either a 4, 6, or 0.  I have on last chance.  If the mystery destiny is the 6, I  kill both skywalkers and have a chance to outdrain him.  My destinies are 4, 4.  I lose.<br/>
<br/>
FL ~10-15<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Killing Leia twice.<br/>
<br/>
Lows: Herb annoyed me as usual<br/>
I lost.<br/>
<br/>
Josh Grace got first.  Everyone else didn’t.<br/>
<br/>
Grace and me played X-files afterwards.  My one puny adversary took out his entire team of 5 guys in a single battle.  If only that game didn’t take forever to play.<br/>
<br/>
Props: Graham for forgetting his decks at home and playing Jerry’s CPI (non-obj) deck.<br/>
Josh for winning.<br/>
Me for beating Mike.<br/>
<br/>
Slops: Garrett for not coming and therefor creating a bye.<br/>
Me for losing to Herb.<br/>
Herb.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody go buy some WWF cards.  The first expansion just came out, and I can’t wait to lay the smackdown on y’all with my new Kurt Angle deck.  Oh it’s true, it’s damn true.<br/>
