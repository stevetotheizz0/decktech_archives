<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I learned a couple things at DCon that helped me with this tourney.<br/>
<br/>
1) tracking destiny is the most important thing you can do.  The difference between drawing a 6 and a 0 is the difference in having another vader in the battle.<br/>
<br/>
2) Unless your deck is about mad draining - patience is a virtue.<br/>
<br/>
3) Every card you deploy is a 1 force loss.<br/>
<br/>
After spending a decent amount of time to “tweak” my decks during the week, I decide to play the following:<br/>
<br/>
DS - HDADTJ, with tons of power. Recyclable 6s and the DS space threat of talon roll with matching black pilots (so they would never lose).  It kills profit, because I will never give up the AC, and profit is too predictable to be weak in space.  EBO is a tough matchup, but I go right to hoth and try to put pressure on with visage and drains on hoth, I can handle most space - but capital heavy decks would be a tough matchup.  HB xwings are in serious trouble between visage and getting talon rolled out of existance.<br/>
<br/>
LS - TIGIH high destiny, anger fears.  Start battle plans (key to deck) and wait.  They have to do something since a drain of two will be eating at them, or they can pick him up with an imperial scrub and lose two, or pick him up with vader and then I will convert vader.  If I win three battles, vader is turned, since I can easily track a 6 to the bottom of my force pile and activate all but the last card - 6 - you are dead.  Otherwise, I have the super falcon to drain at Kessel - EPP Obi to battle at 11 power, and orrimarko to battle at 10 power and lose two (especially good against SYCFA, which will lose three force but not take battle damage).  This deck is all about tracking destiny 6s.  Either a few manuevers or throw me another charge - yes you will show them your deck for throw me another charge, but there is also no requirements to play it.<br/>
<br/>
First Game - My DS vs. HB xwings<br/>
He isnt ready for HDADTJ, so visage takes its toll.  He has bousch down as fast as I have vader, so that drain is blocked, but vader does his job by keeping visage off me.  After I make sure that I am comfortable at the DS docking bay I go to setup in space.  He has setup with General Cal in gold sq 1 (not going there) at Endor.  I choose to go to some random site, where he has green leader in his ship and two xwings.  He has one force save (I am sure for the out of nowhere).  I drop a black tie with matching pilot and talon roll green leader (his two destinies just became one) and a capital ship (I cannot find the Combined fleet CO - or else this would have really hurt).  I win big.  Same thing happens again and now I have two battleground systems and the site - so welcome viasge back (honor had come out).  A late game attempt to flip me back with luke and obi - meets vader, tarkin, tempest 1, and you are beaten.  Obi gets hit, lord vader has too much defense value and the game is over.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+19)<br/>
<br/>
Game Two - LS vs Dark Deal (Robert Schaak)<br/>
This is the type of matchup I feared (the deck - not the kid) - and had he deployed one system, he would have won without much of a problem.  He does not comes down first turn with some random imperial at the endor docking bay  - so I get the drain of one and move over.  He pulls the bespin cloud sector and tells me to go.  I just draw up - cuz my opening hand was junk.  I get cappy han and kessel - so I am set.  I will have to time it right.  Next turn, imp scrub gets luke and goes to bespin.  He takes his time, and I start to feel the pressure of dark deal looming, so I go right kessel for that drain of three - never was contested.  What won me this game was battle order/anger fear.  He had to activate and that meant losing to anger fear.  He sets up the DD and away we go - Vader is with the emporer and grabbed luke (is not losing for that either now).  Big problem was I could never win a battle since he was plus 4 in power, so Vader kept Luke close and there was not much I could do.  I hardly deploy any cards and retrieve 5 twice and a couple more with draw their fires, slashing vader to release luke and drain a couple times for free.  I had an anger fear in his deck the whole game.  He eventually comes to take on Obi and Orrimarrko - but I get to battle, so I retrieve another card and he loses another card.  I draw a 5 and have 15, but mara + DD + destiny +1 for the sector it’s a tie.  He clears the site (actually hurts him now) cuz next turn AFA pops and he loses 4, then 3 to kessel does him in.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know if I would do anything different - I could have waited for him to deploy the sector and drop the falcon on him, but I wanted to put a little more pressure on him since he was siting at the downtown plaza and draining waiting for me to do something.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 +9 -- 4(+28)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 LS vs Bryan Prittie DS Clint Hayes speeder ROps<br/>
This is why I start battle plan - and should have been more patient in deploying the falcon.  He picks up Luke with a scrub right away, and is losing two for that.  He is not draining me since the 3 per drain would slow him down.  He spreads thin but does not leave force to react with - win one battle and a couple force. I have a bunch of 6 floating around and good destiny - I retrieve 5 and now I have no lost pile.  I am clearly ahead and he has to do something about coming to space.  He makes the mistake of trying to take out captain han in falcon with fett in slave 1 - I know - punch it - 5 destinies (forgot the darklighter spin which would have been 8 more! - that card is coming out for another frozen assets anyway).  He loses big in space and another card on the stack.  One more EPP Obi battle against a no reacting biker and the game is over.  I only inserted 1 anger fear and that got projected, but the battle damage was sufficient.  Again this game is a great example of the difference between deploy a lot of cards and hardly any cards.<br/>
<br/>
FW +31 -- 6(+59)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 DS vs. Dave Hendersons Profit mains.<br/>
I start dengar and mara in the AC - but do not have vader or DS pilot or black tie in my opening hand (10 cards to make the deck and I do not have 1 of them).  I activate 6 and grab maras saber, I see I activated a vader so I draw the next 5 and no vader - damn 1 force to pay for the saber. He drops Ben and initiates and trys to play weapon lev to take the saber, but I get first just action and projective telepathy the battle (no force left).  Next turn I drop IG88 and battle (knowing I am going to lose the saber - what am I supposed to do - do not leave the AC!!)  I knock out Ben and I lose Mara to a 1 in attrition - why?  Because that leaves dengar and IG88 - which is one destiny.  If he pops dengar with Luke he controls the AC but ends the battle - so I protect against mad damage from a mains barrage.  I draw hoping for one of the two vaders I activate and get one on the second draw.  Fortunately he does not have what he needs and just draws.  Next turn I drop vader and put pressure on with visage - he soon grabs honor and no one is losing for now.  Next turn, I drop tarkin and the AC is looking pretty solid.  I still have not done anything in space, but I am siting on Kashyyk, devestator, and chiranau.  So after I am comfortable in the AC, I use all my force one turn to drop that space combo.  Next turn he drops cracken to JP (to satisfy coward) and epp leia to the AC - free han with Someone WLY- and move out of the AC.  Next turn I drop another destroyer and piett to sullest and have two drains of 3 in space and a drain of three on the ground - along with visage.  He cannot drain (leia and flipped HDADTJ) and drops gold leader in gold 1 to take out chiraneau and is successful although the devestator lives.  So I am in control and quickly drain him out and visage him out.<br/>
<br/>
FW +18 -- 8 (+77)<br/>
<br/>
I have to point out that David was one of the best people to play HDADTJ against.  He always lost to visage without being reminded and did not even try to drain with leia.  It was a real pleasure to play someone who did not need to be “reminded” about these things.<br/>
<br/>
So this is the first time I have managed to go 4-0, and I am glad my decks worked well.  Wisconsin has a good group of people who are getting into serious tournament playing.  We setup a listserve for the state and it is already paying off for better tournament attendance.  Hopefully the janesville and green bay crowd will get off their duffs and make it to the next big one Nov. 18th.  Check the list for details.<br/>
