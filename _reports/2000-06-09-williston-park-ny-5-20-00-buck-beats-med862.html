<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Yes, it's the tournament report you've all been waiting for. The report from my loss to Bucksun Lee! Yes, I, a 1600+ player actually lost to the 1300 player named Bucksun Lee. I show up at the store, Grasshoppers, pay admission, and see some regulars there. I'm using this Rops deck that I've been using for around 2 or 3 months now. Light is my Profit deck that's similar to Hickey's except I don't own any Ben Kenobi's. It's gone 3-1 in tournaments thus far and is undefeated outside of tournament play.  I get paired game 1 with Scuba Steve Sferlazza.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My Rops Vs. Steve Sferlazza's Rebel Strike Team<br/>
I start IAO to his Goo Nee Tay. Ww both draw up for awhile. He drops Joroen Webb and some 2/2 guy to the Bunker and has Tantive and EPP Luke sitting above Raltiir. I set up with unique AT-ST's over Raltiir. I get out Secret Plans, Come Here You Big Coward to kill his drains, and Search and Destroy but he Alters that. A turn or two later I get some 2/2 guy and Zuckuss in Mist Hunter above Raltiir. I flip and I clear his guys while losing my 2/2 scrub. I keep draining him on the ground and he's not doing much. He gets out EPP Han and Tawss Khaa to one of my Raltiir sites. Next turn with a tracked 5, I Trample Tawss and beat up Han. I also tried to send Mara on his guys at the Bunker but Double Agent and Joreon Webb kill her. My draining for 3 keeps wearing him down. He gets Spiral and some pilot above Endor. My turn I Lateral Damage the Spiral and drop a Dreadnaught with some pilot guys aboard. I beat up his ship. Then he's tryingto blow away the Bunker but keeps failing. I just drain him out. I win by 23.<br/>
FW 2(+23)<br/>
Highlights: Trampling Tawss, winning<br/>
Lowlights: Mara getting Double Agent on her<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My Profit Vs. Garth McLaren's COTVG w/o Feeding<br/>
He starts the three effects and Mara with a CC Engineer. I go with Scramble. He converts my Audience Chamber and drops out some sites and stuff for the next few turns. He eventually sets up Boba in Slave I draining for 2 at Kiffex and moves Mara and CC Engineer to my Jabba's Palace. He reconverts my JP and deploys Scum and Villainy. I drop Master Luke with Saber to Audience Chamber, free Han, flip, and cancel Scum and Villainy. Then everything goes downhill. He's draining me for like 3 to 4 a turn and he keep's retrieving it with a redployed S&amp;V. He eventually kills Han. I get to redeploy him but it's too late. His bounty hunters along with his massive retrieval are just too much. Profit doesn't fare too well against Court usually and without Ben it makes it alot harder. I lose by 26.<br/>
FL 2(-3)<br/>
Highlights: Cancelling S&amp;V<br/>
Lowlights: He redeployed S&amp;V and he just killed me.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My Rops Vs. Chris Liotta's TR Mains <br/>
Well, we've done this match up twice before and I won so I'm pretty confident. I start Imperial Arrest Order. I set up on Raltiir with unique AT-STs. He gets mains with weapons on me but I capture EPP Luke with a tracked 5 and IG-88. My reacting and high forfeit guys hold out on Raltiir. He has Red Leader in Red 1 at like Kessel with an X-wing Cannon. I send a Dreadnaught full of pilots on it and he discovers that X-wing Cannons can't shoot capital ships. Sucks for him. He loses some overflow from that. Search and Destroy, Ability, Ability, Ability, and my drain of 4 a turn does him in. I win by 22.<br/>
FW 4(+19)<br/>
Highlights: Most of the game especially the tracked 5 to get Luke.<br/>
Lowlights: none<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My Profit Vs. Bucksun Lee's Huntdown w/o dueling<br/>
I start Goo Nee Tay to his Bad Feeling Have I. We both draw up and take Visage damage most of the early part of the game. He then reconverts my Cantina, Jabba's Palace, and Audience Chamber. He gets Vader, Evazan, Dengar with Gun, and Tarkin to Cantina. I drop Boussh there to block the drain. After several turns she gets Snipered and he has Mara with Saber and Boba with Gun at spaceport Docking Bay draining but I Lost in the Wilderness Mara. I get Master Luke and Anakin's Saber to JP to flip, free Han, and retrieve 10. Then he Elis Helrots all his guys from the Cantina to the Audience Chamber. He hits Han and operates. He plays I Have You Now. I lose Luke and like 20 overflow. I pretty much lost. I get Obi and Saber to Spaceport Docking Bay and then proceed to beat on Boba. Then Visage does me in. I lose by 16! Ahhhh, I lost to Buck, I suck now, what happened!?!<br/>
FL 4(+6)<br/>
Highlights: None<br/>
Lowlights: Losing to Buck, what else do you want?<br/>
<br/>
All in all it was okay. I get like 10th out of 16. Garth wins the tournament. For prizes I get Tarn Mison dude, Advantage, We'll Find Han, All Wings Report In foil, Surface Defense Cannon, and Point Man. I pretty much give up on my Profit deck. Later, and I'll have my report of the next tournament soon.     <br/>
