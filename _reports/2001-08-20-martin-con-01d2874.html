<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">So, here’s how it started.  Alex was over at my house because his stepdad had triple bypass sugery.  I invited edwin and phillip, and we got started.  I don’t really remember the games all that well, actually it was only 1 game.  GAME 1:my WYS vs. Phillip’s No money no parts no deal.<br/>
ummmm.... he won, by alot.<br/>
GAME 2: yes, the second game which we weren’t able to finish.  I was playing edwin, but that’s beside the point<br/>
THE IMPORTANT GAME 2:Phillip’s Mind What You Have Learned Vs. Alex’s ......deck<br/>
If they had finished the game alex would’ve lost by only about 10 but only because he kept messing up phillip’s tracking<br/>
So here are the final standings:<br/>
4th place-Alex Olivo-differential=0(-41)<br/>
3rd place-Martin Warlick(woo hoo!)-differential=0(-36)<br/>
2nd place-Phillip Marshall-differential=2(36)<br/>
1st place-Edwin Harris-differential=2(41)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WELL, THAT WAS MARTIN-CON, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME TO IT-<br/>
