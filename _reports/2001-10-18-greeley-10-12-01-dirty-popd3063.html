I believe the last tournament that I played in was July 21 01.  Then I turned 21, so drinking became a pastime.  Then Coruscant came out and out of 3 boxes I didn&amp;#8217;t get a Queen Amidala.  Then soon after Coruscant school started, so I havnt been able to play SW for quite some time.  I had been flirting with retirement for that long,  until now.  <br/>
<br/>
With very little play testing, and very few modifications to my decks I decided to play some sanctioned Star Wars again in my old stomping grounds in Greeley at the Digital Dungeon.  Since my pseudo retirement I have been very wary of wanting to bring my 1955 rating to the card tables in fear of scrubbing out, so this is my first tournament since the end of July, and in the &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; Coruscant meta (Insert Sarcasm Here).<br/>
<br/>
It was an eight player tournament with my old play testing friend Tom Meade, and my nemesis Tom Kathman, who at one point had a higher rating than me, in other words he took control of the stomping grounds in Greeley.  I had some old decks that I was VERY comfortable with playing which are Pods, Profit, and @#$%es  &amp; Mauls Phat Palatial Estate on Tatooine.  We would only be playing 4 games it seemed so  I was hoping to go undefeated.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 Tom Meade (1883) SYCFA vs. Pods, Profit, and @#$%es!<br/>
Hum, well now that I am back in the game, it makes sense for me to play Tom  . . . again.  Tom is playing this interesting  SYCFA non-flipper that sets up Palpy in the DB and then he gets systems from the deck with the Coruscant location grabber, sets up Big Blue for massive space drains.  He likes the deck, and says its solid, but against Profit it is pretty weak, and he is even aware.  He is pure space, and I am pure ground.  I get to retreive AND do direct damage, AND drain, and it takes him a while to set up.  So first turn he does not get one of his 5 Palpys in his opening hand so that gives me the opportunity to mess with his game plan.  On my first turn I activate like 10, I gift for Qui-Gon stick during my activate and then deploy Qui-Gon /w stick to the DS DB ; )  That should pretty much do it.  In the next turns we try to get to our strategies, but soon I win the race, than I free Han, retreive 5, and then I get some more back from I did it!  Draining all the while.  I am doing severe damage to him, he needs to make a move, and he take the wrong move I think.  He deploys EPP Vader to the DB and then deploys Palpy to the war room next door.  He is thinking that he can swing and hit Vader.  After he deploys both of those I use I wish to board at once to grab TCFC and he has no force in his force pile to pay the cost of 2, although he had Battle Plan on the table to battle.  So there I pretty much had him shut down, I would battle Vader on my turn hit him, cancel Vader&amp;#8217;s swing and then I draw destiny and Vader is gone, and he would never control a battleground site to get around his Battle Plan.  He draws up knowing that I would just decimate him even more and I win by +31<br/>
<br/>
2 +31<br/>
Highs: Qui-Gon w/ Stick to the DS: DB is too damn good.  <br/>
Lows: Beating Tom down in this obvious bad match up for him.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Adam Peabody (1385) Profit vs. Mauls Palatial Estate<br/>
I read some where on the internet that this is an auto win.  Not only is this an auto-win, but this is an auto shalaking.  I get two aliens in the AC and then overlay his locations, force choking him, the Bad Feeling Have I in opening hand does not help for Adam.  I know how these games go, they arent pretty.  It isn&amp;#8217;t really worth commenting, but Adam never flipped and I just beat him down wherever I could on Tatooine, manly the AC, Full Win for me +32<br/>
<br/>
 4 + 63<br/>
Highs: Knowing whats it feels like to be on the other side of Profits worst match up for once.<br/>
Lows: It just wasn&amp;#8217;t fair for Adam, not fair at all . . . Mwahahahaha!<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Mike Palser (1535) MKOS mains and drains vs. Pods, Profit, and @#$%es!<br/>
Wow another retarded  match up here.  Mike is just starting to get into competitive SW and he has good ideas for decks.  This deck had just beaten Kathman the game before, but come on its MKOS ; )  Opening hand here was Qui-Gon, EPP Leia, Padme, and Panaka.  Pretty good I think.  I started the Camp, and he started POTH, with Mighty Jabba, and Chokk in the AC  So he begins to bring more characters into the AC, and Chokk makes them almost impossible to kill, so I need to send in a massive horde.  I look for some cards, and get Obi Stick and Bacta Tank, and I save force, I get out my cantina, City Outskirts so I have all my locations on the table.  I sit there and wait to see what he deploys while I save force.  When I decide to deploy he has Jabba, Chokk, Boelo, Bib, Ephont Mon, and Darth Maul with stick.  This is gonna be hellacious.  I drop the Bacta Tank, I then drop Padme, Padme gets Ben, Qui-Gon, and Panaka w/ blaster.  I battle.  I swing at Maul, draw a 6 and a 5, so he is hit.  Maul swings at Ben, get a one and a four . . . Whew.  I try to shoot with Panaka but I draw a one and with Chokk the lowest DV there was a three so that&amp;#8217;s a miss.  He gets to draw 3 destiny cause he plays an adder and has Jabba with a leader, and he cancels mine.  So I revive Qui-Gon and we continue.  On his turn he battles, weapon levs my saber and draws great destiny so I revive Qui Gon, and put Padme on the Tank. I keep digging for cards, I play Leia the next turn and he barriers her, and play Padme again.  I battle miss with Panaka again, and I revive Qui-Gon.  I draw up more cards, and I get Lando, Chewie Prot, and Massa Luke.  I then say, it is on!  But Mike also has something  planned, by now I have won the pod race so I retrieved force and  he lost stuff.  He comes down with Mara w/ Stick, and Guri, which is bad.  He battles and I miss again, he misses with Mara and I revive Qui-Gon, and  put Padme on the tank . . . Again.  On my turn I play Lando, Chewie, and Massa Luke, and Padme, also I get Qui-Gon stick too.  You can see where is goes from here.  I play Double Agent on Mara, but I fail with a 1.  I then cancel Chokk&amp;#8217;s gay game text so I can clear the board up this turn.  I battle.  Luke sends Ephont Mon away, Lando excludes Boelo, Panaka shoots Bib Fortuna, and Qui-Gon kills Mara, Leia kills Chokk.  I get to draw A destiny due to Guri, which was a five.  So I pretty much decimate the AC with no loses, and I had Goo Nee Tay in my hand.  Mike Draws up, knowing about the incoming death I would have had forced him too.  It was a well played mains game, but LS mains are better than alien mains, therefore I win.  Full Win +28<br/>
<br/>
6 + 91<br/>
Highs: Every main, and their grandmother duking it out in the AC, that&amp;#8217;s Star Wars to me!<br/>
Lows: None.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Tom Kath man (1833) Hidden Base B-Wings vs. Mauls Palatial Estate<br/>
This is an easy game to report because it was all about the Pod Race, and that&amp;#8217;s all it was.  I get a sick hand.  I have Maul w/ stick in my hand, and I would play Mara w/ stick turn 2.  I had some decent ships too, w/ lateral damage to do some probes, in the early stage, but this is one of the first times I have EVER seen a game just be a Podrace.  My deck runs a Podracer and like 20 5+ destinies to be an awesome battle deck, and to compete with the race.  I also run 4 senses, and 2 Podracer collisions.  I saw 2 senses and both Collisions, which is awesome, but I think I hade the worst luck ever.  It started off good, I drew a Palpy so I was at nine.  Next turn I see Tom pull a step backward and I have 2 senses in my hand, along with maul on the table.  He plays step backward on my activate, and I sense it.  I then flip a 2 and he gets a 6 and a 5.  So I&amp;#8217;m ahead still.  Next Turn I draw up a Podracer collision, but I though I&amp;#8217;d wait till I could @#$% him over  with it.  So I was patient.  Next draw I get a 1 and he gets a 4 and a 5.  I&amp;#8217;m at 18 to his 20.  For the next draw I play Podracer collision (losing 2 force) and I get ahead keeping him from drawing 3 race destinies.  So I draw a 3 which puts me at 24 and he gets up to 24 which means I could flash the next turn.  He plays a step, I have to sense it, and I do.  I go to draw to and get my other collision . . . So I should have it won!  Next turn he plays a step backward and I lose my flash (20-24), which is ok with the Collision in my hand right? So during my activate I play collision and get a 5, damn, no flash, so I HAVE to draw good.  I&amp;#8217;m at 20, and he&amp;#8217;s at 19 I think I have good odds of winning it.  I have a lot of 5&amp;#8217;s in my deck so I should be good, right?  I made my deck to come through in these situations.  But as luck sees it in this game I am an @#$% so I draw a one and Tom draws a 7 and a 4 which brings me to 24 and him at 30.  He wins, I have no plans on the table so there is a 12 force swing, he flips objective and out drains me.  On a side not, I might have had a better chance of winning if I had not lost search and destroy early off the top of my deck.  But oh well I lose to Kathman for the second time ever, second time in a row . . . Which is showing my weakness as a player ; ) Just kidding Tom.  Full Loss -17<br/>
<br/>
6 + 74<br/>
Highs: I got two senses and two Podracer Collisions against a good Podracing deck.<br/>
Lows: I lost a Podrace with the Podrace tech . . . Which is bull @#$% and I thought I played pretty well.  But it just goes to show that it don&amp;#8217;t matter how well you may play or construct your deck sometimes the Gods of CCG just look at you and piss on you with their big ole porn star donkey @#$%s . . . John Holmes style: the X-Rated Nigga!    <br/>
<br/>
I ended with 6 + 74 and Tom Kathman ended with 6 +76, see the afore mentioned pissing on me.  So I get second in MY stomping ground, which is okay I guess, I mean I HAVE been out of the loop for like 2 months, but @#$% it, I get down to the rhythm.  <br/>
<br/>
In an afterward my packs sucked @#$% and we didn&amp;#8217;t draw for foils cause @#$%-@#$% Decipher doesnt print Prize Support or run Conventions in times of Crisis . . . They however do release REF 3 on Oct 31, LOTR Nov 7, and Theed Palace on Nov 31.  I guess Decipher thinks we are all rich muthas during an American economic @#$%fest . . . I&amp;#8217;m just hoping I don&amp;#8217;t get anthrax from snorting cocaine that I got smuggled through Florida by a Mexican and an Arab named Osama . . . Eat it!<br/>
<br/>
I think we played some RISK 2210 and my luck continued to anally rape me for the next couple of hours, I hope the local authorities don&amp;#8217;t find out about my drugs ; )<br/>
<br/>
PROPS<br/>
Tom Kathman: for running a Tournament and letting me play in it, that was awfully niiiiice of him.<br/>
On The Line Soundtrack: Holy Brittany, NSYNC, Mandy Moore, and Al Green, what more could a reformed boy band lover ask for (Well other than a Mandy Moore, Brittany Spears Sex Sandwich?)<br/>
My Decks: In general after two months they still kinda rock.<br/>
My opponents: for being fun to play, especially Mike, that game was the @#$%, on the rocks!<br/>
Wendy&amp;#8217;s: For being there to fulfill my belly&amp;#8217;s urges after getting pissed on my the SW CCG Gods.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
Tom Kathman, for not letting me beat his Podracer like a good Podracing deck!<br/>
Maul deck:  You are not supposed to draw ones for race destiny!<br/>
SW: CCG Gods: I really hate getting pissed on,.<br/>
Decipher: See the above mentioned  shenanigans.<br/>
RISK 2210: The dice did not agree with my strategy, so the game does not agree with me.<br/>
Osama Bin Ladin: Ya, a skull@#$%ing here is definitely in order.<br/>
Chris Fanchii:  The more things change the less things stay the same ; )<br/>
<br/>
If you havnt noticed, I have been partaking in an alcoholic beverage for the last portion of this TR!<br/>
