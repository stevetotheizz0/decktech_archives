<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay just to let you know this is an unsanctioned chase the squirrel tournament, so it might be a tad bit weird. I hope you enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Pre Tournament:<br/>
It all start*s a week before the tournament when Don (a local tournament director) announces a whole bunch of tournament at the same time. I don*t know what he says but I talk to some people I know from local tournaments, online, and they say there*s one so I*m like what the heck. So I make some decks (well actually only a dark side because I already had a light side). My light side*s tosche station, and after about 30 minutes of hard work I come up with a BHBM pods deck. So I attend the local CCG night. I play 2 games with my dark, winning once by 11 or something and then losing by something close to that, and I witness hilarious argument about magic, where this guys like *my decks so much better than yours because its type 2 and your using banned cards*, and the other guy is like *No, its only restricted*. Magic is such a funny game. So I figure my darks pretty okay considering that I made it by my self. So the night before the tourney I*m like talking to Eddie Brown and Mike Merletto online and they say that there*s a tourney but its JK, so they*re like just come anyways and maybe we can have a tournament, so I was like whatever, and they*re like Rob and the other Mike are going too. So I go to see Final Fantasy, which is a really cool movie, too bad I fall asleep at the end where like the good guys win and things explode and stuff. So I get home and mess with my dark side a little and put in some more high-destiny pod-damaging stuff, and stuff like that and go to bed at about like 11. So I wake up in the morning and I watch TV and play College Slam and stuff, and then at about 1030 my dad drives me over to Durham, and drops me off at sports cards unlimited. I see the 4 people I knew would come. And so I*m like teach me how to track (I*m a major scrub) so Mike (Merletto) is like okay. So he shows me some stuff like with Mirax, and I still didn*t really get it but it helped. <br/>
<br/>
The Tournament:<br/>
So Pat the TD comes out and he*s like *well, no one showed up for JK, so you guys want to play some weird chase the squirrel thing where you get like a pack of Dagobah, 2 packs of Hoth, and 2 packs of R2 fro 12 bucks and make a 40 card deck from it and like you can have cards from both sides and stuff*. So everyone*s like whatever. So I pay my $12 and I pull Hoth Luke, foil Home 1, and foil Bossk with gun, and some crap. I make my deck, here it is:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*********REMEMBER THESE DECKS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE BOTH SIDES IN THEM********<br/>

Keep in mind that this deck is 40 cards, and both sides can be used. The point of the deck is to like draw high destiny and use green cards to make your dudes more powerful, look at your opponent*s stuff and use the Ghhhk, Barrier, and wookie kiss to your advantage. <br/>
<br/>
Matchups: Pats like does anyone want the bye, and like no one did so he was like okay we*ll have a three player game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 Me vs. Mike Kimosh vs. Eddie Brown<br/>
First off the 3 player rules that Pat made up on the spot were really weird, the odd man out (in this case Eddie) only generates force from his locations, and you can only drain the people that have the icons that you*re draining with. So Eddie starts Ice Plains or something and Mike starts the Audience Chamber. We draw destiny to see who goes first. The order is Mike, Me, Eddie. Mike goes and deploys Nemet to the AC. I activate 4, and put Commander Luke with some Hoth Survival Gear on him to the 3rd marker, and I deploy some site on CC. Eddie activates some and deploys a few twixs, and comes down with a huge beat squad on the poor little Nemet (Eddie didn*t hear the rule that you only activate your icons). Mike loses like 15 overflow and revives Nemet with an Old Ben. On his turn Mike deploys an Ice storm and draws up. I drain Mike 2 with Luke, and put a Salacious Crumb with him, and I drop some scrubs at the CC site. At this time I have like a ghhhk, wookie kiss, and a barrier in my hand so I*m like o yeah! On Eddie*s turn he activates 10 freaking force, and drops like some scrubs to battle the lone Nemet again. That*s like another 15 overflow. At this point Mike knows he can*t win, his Ice Storm dies, and he*s getting drained for like 10 each turn, so he*s out. Eddie starts draining me 2, and I drain him like 8 with some more CC sites I put out. I win.<br/>
2(+21)<br/>
<br/>
Good- Winning by so much.<br/>
Bad- The 3 person thing not really working out too good.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Me vs. Rob Werbecki<br/>
Okay this game really goes bad for me, so if you want just skip on down to where it says how much I lost by. Well he*s playing force choke so he starts like throne room or something. I start the normal; I win the draw to go first. I draw 2 I think and save 1. Rob deploys some twixs and JP. I have like NO characters in my hand. So I deploy the EC with the extra drain thing facing me. Rob deploys some scrub like Ak-rev I think to my starting place and some dudes at JP and EC. I*m like oh man, I*m gana lose. I use frustration and target his Bothowei, and save up the rest of my force. Luckily for me he deployed it with the light side icons facing him, and I just happened to have Home 1 in my hand. I deploy it. For the next couple of turns we drain each other back and forth, me draining 2 and him like 5. I decide something must be done, so I attack his lone Bomar Monk. He falls back to the AC. That*s about game right there. He comes and beats me down. I lose.<br/>
2(+10?)<br/>
Good- making him deploy a system where I drain him 2. <br/>
Bad- losing by 11, not drawing many characters. <br/>
<br/>
Game 3  Me vs. Mike Kimosh <br/>
He starts AC, and he draws a 7 to go first, at least it*s at the bottom of his deck now. So I get some dudes to the AC, and deploy some of my sites. He puts his JEDI LUKE FOIL that he pulled from one of his R2s at my 3rd marker. I send that freak missing with my ice storm of doom. I*m draining like for 5 or 6 a turn and he*s trying to get his Jedi Luke out of the deep snow, and at the same time draining me of an excellent 0. So I spread out some more to drain like 8 and deploy the war room. He finally finds Luke, and starts draining me two, and one a DB he deployed to Hoth, then he starts moving in to my war room, which he has to pass a drain 0 site, which I don*t really get. I drain him out. I win. <br/>
4(+25?)<br/>
<br/>
Good- Regaining the diff that I lost the last game.<br/>
Bad- None.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Me vs. Eddie Brown<br/>
He starts D*2 throne room, so I*m like oh crap, another force choke. So he puts some rebel trooper Hoth guy with merc armor at my site, and he*s like a good strategy is to stack dudes at a drain 2 site. So I*m like whatever, and I can*t get enough freaking force to do anything, so I start saving up. He*s draining me for 2 every turn and its getting really annoying so, I decide to put out my EC and drain him 2 there, but then I realize that my Commander Luke that*s in my hand only deploys on hoth, so I let him take over the EC. Then I deploy Bossk and Luke to his huge site (which he had got like 15 power on), and moved away to some twix he deployed. I freaking forgot to drain him like 3 times, but I moved my slowly developed Hit Squad over. He*s like whatever and keeps his people there. In a few battles I*ve worn him down to like a few guys, so I battle he takes some overflow damage, I drain him 2 there, and then I start draining 2 at the other site. I win.<br/>
6(+29) <br/>
<br/>
Good- Winning and being one of two that only lost once.<br/>
Bad- Forgetting to drain a whole bunch ( I am such a scrub).<br/>
<br/>
Well I win the tourney and a pack of R2 with a foil SFS in it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I play a couple of fun games, win one by 45 (that*s right, 45), Lose the other by like 10 or something I think it was more though.<br/>
