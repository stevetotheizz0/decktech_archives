<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">When my friends and I first heard about states we are all psyched up and ready to win.  So, my friend Ryan has Grey and I go over to his house to prepare for states.  So when we all get there we look at our cheesy decks that we have had for about a month now.  I sit down and look at my RST, and then it strikes me, this deck just sucks.  So while Ryan and Grey are playing their decks Grey starts to get mad because of a Cantina Brawl on his Mara Jade.  So while they are arguing I am thinking "How can I make a good RST deck?"  I decide to put in Tala 1, Cracken, Tala 2, Blount, and take out some scouts for EPP Han, EPP Luke, EPP Leia, and EPP Obi.  Now the decks needs a good polish, so I add 2 Punch It’s, Captain Han, and a couple of Out of Nowheres.  Now I move on to my BHBM deck.  It is very solid and I figure out what would beat it.  So I add Jodo for anti-WYS, and Dengar w/gun for Raiders.  The deck is now solid.  So we start to playtest around 9:00.  I play Grey’s Ralops deck (I told him it was dead). We get off to a good start and I get out Menace Fades and Battle Plan.  So by now he is screwed if the doesn’t come to me.  He uses Elis, but I use Quite A Mercenary and he loses, Janus, a couple troopers, and his idea was dead.  I drain and win by about 25.  My BHBM deck just crushes both of their decks, but I didn’t get to play Ryan’s Hunt Down Duel deck.  So we get to bed around 1:30.   We wake up and get our stuff ready.  We leave at 8:00.  We get there at about 9:30 and start filling out our decklist. <br/>
<br/>
I am playing RST Flip w/Ithorians and Superfalcon.  BHBM w/trooper beatdown.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: BHBM vs Forgot his name Agents in the Court<br/>
I knew this would be interesting, and we started off with a quick battle.  I had Vader, Blizzard 2, 4-5 Biker Scouts, and Empy.  I play Trooper Assault, and he reacts with his Sandspeeders.  I win the battle by like 8-10 and he loses 1 for Insig. Rebellion.  So by now I am draining for about 5, but I can’t stop his Tessek.  He drains for about 8, and eventually wins because of a crappy hand that I had.  <br/>
<br/>
FL (-19)<br/>
<br/>
Props: For not realizing how good Agents in the court is<br/>
<br/>
Slops: Losing to Agents in the Court, and almost converting Luke (I drew a 4 and a 5 plus 3 which is 12, and you have to get greater than 12:(<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:RST vs Ryan Page’s BHBM flip<br/>
Ha, what a coincedence.  My deck vs my own.  I knew his deck was cheesy.  He used Tempest Scouts with a At-ST dual cannon.  So I get set up with Strike Planning and flip turn 4.  I basically out drain him and win by 20.<br/>
<br/>
2(+1)<br/>
<br/>
Props: none, I won<br/>
<br/>
Slops: I felt sorry that he came in last place<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: BHBM vs MWYHL Luke<br/>
When I saw Luke come out I said this game is mine.  First turn I get Vader to CC: Docking bay and get out Search and Destroy.  Next turn he comes to battle my troopers at Endor Back Door.  He wins by 3-4.  Next turn I come down with Igar on Tempest 1, Guri, Jodo Kast, Dengar with Gun, Vader, a Couple troopers.  I play Trooper Assault and he loses the battle by 18.  So by know I figured I have won.  He deploys Obi-Wan to my site, but had no force to iniate a battle.  So I bring my punks over and next turn battle.  I use Dark Jedi Presence, Trooper Assault, and have power of like 70.  He loses the game there and I win by 21.<br/>
<br/>
4(+22)<br/>
Props: Laying a beatdown<br/>
<br/>
Slops: to see someone train Luke, gosh he lost 4 a turn with Your Destiny and Search and Destroy.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: RST vs AotBS<br/>
He layed the smackdown on my deck.  I try to flip, but can’t because of ZinMH, Bossk in Bus, and Ig in ship.  I drop Home One, Hobbie w/Red Squadron 4, and Wedge in ship.  He barriers Wedge and Sets for stun Hobbie, and lateral Damages Home One.  I lose about 25 force there and I can’t recover.  I get Noble Sacrifice out and retrieve 8, but he drains for 5 and I have to lose 2 for Empy and Xizor.<br/>
<br/>
FL 4(-6)<br/>
<br/>
Props:Seeing the best AotBS there<br/>
<br/>
Slops: for not putting in Desperate Reach and Hassh’n<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: RST vs Jason Lambeths Hunt Down<br/>
This is on of the best games in my life.<br/>
We start off fast and I cancel Visage.  I flip and drain for about 8, he drains for about 8.  We never really battled, but I lost on the last turn because of Stupid U-3p0.  He wins by 3.  It was more of a drain race, but very fun.<br/>
<br/>
FL 4(-9)<br/>
<br/>
Props:the funniest games in my life<br/>
<br/>
Slops:for not putting Corran Horn in<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: BHBM vs EBO<br/>
This was fun to, and I made a very bad mistake.  I drop Blizzard 2 to North Ridge with Jodo and a few troopers.  He gets out his speeders and we battle.  I play trooper Assualt.  He has power of about 25 to my 16.  I forfeit everything, and he uses Ice Storm (the LS version of it) and makes Jodo and the Scouts go missing.  I am pissed.  I drop another beatdown squad and win.  He has Luke but aboard a speeder so I can’t capture him.  The last turn I drain for 6 and he only has 6 left.  So I win by 6.<br/>
<br/>
FW 6(-3)<br/>
<br/>
Props: Funnest tourney in my life<br/>
<br/>
Slops: Forgetting about Ice Storm<br/>
<br/>
Well, after that Adam Weinnstann (sorry if I mispelled it Adam) wins NC States.  I also learned a lot more, and now I play WAY better decks.   I hope to win the next tourney which is coming soon.<br/>
