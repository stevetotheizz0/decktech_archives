<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">OK, first thing’s first, I am considered a newbie player of the game, and I don’t think I have yet been able to "break through as a better competitive player. However, after every tournament I learn more. I brought my friend Brian there to play also. So here’s how it all went for me at my most recent attempt at a local tournament. Laugh at me as much as you want. My decks are a BHBM deck that I’m not so sure about and a WYS deck that somewhat revolves around space and doesn’t use any Luke except farmboy Luke. I feel mostly confident about my light side, but I hope I can do well with both.<br/>
<br/>
Game One: My BHBM vs. A.J. Clemans’ Throne Room<br/>
First turn he has Insurrection down and pulls the Home One docking bay. On my turn I bring out the Emperor and his power to the throne room and pull the Endor docking bay. He pulls the Hoth docking bay and puts a few weak characters down at his docking bays.  Eventually I have Vader and Tarkin at the Endor docking bay, and he’s given me Jedi Luke. I can’t remember a whole lot about the beginning of the game, but I had Leia w/ Blaster captured at one point (by Bossk w/ Gun), but I eventually had to forfeit Bossk so she was released. I got Vader and Tarkin to the DSII docking bay and figured I should get him to lose as much force as I can make him lose, but he moves everyone up there too, and Obi-Wan w/ saber decided to come down. Every time I battled him, Obi-Wan would hit someone and then go to the Bacta Tank. Eventually he killed all my people and Luke was freed. Full loss by 21.<br/>
Highs: capturing Leia and Luke<br/>
Lows: never going to space (either of us), losing by 21<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My WYS vs. Stiv(sp?) McFadden’s Black Sun<br/>
This was a game that I wasn’t sure if I could win or not, but I was confident that my WYS could take this down. Early on his bounty hunters dominate the ground so I go to where I can do the most damage, space. Unfortunately I couldn’t get Menace Fades to block his Vigos, but my space drains helped out a lot. He Lateral Damaged the Pulsar Skate at Kessel (deployed on Coruscant), but I Barriered Boba in Slave I before he could battle me. So I got down to Coruscant to cancel Lateral Damage (after stopping by Ralltiir) and he drops Bossk in Bus. I put down Dash Rendar on the Pulsar Skate and then battle him. I come out on top of the battle, but eventually I lose the game from force drains. Full loss by 14<br/>
Highs: mainly owning space, cancelling Lateral Damage.<br/>
Lows: not many, except for losing<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My BHBM vs. Dave Wells’ Profit<br/>
This was the game I wanted to play. Dave’s a nice guy, and I haven’t played him since a sealed deck game months ago. I start out with Mara Jade and Dr. E &amp; Ponda Baba, checking with the tournament director to make sure this is right. I pull Mara’s saber turn 1, knowing that anything I hit can be immediately lost now. I also get out Emperor Palpatine to the Throne Room. I am more than ready to battle. He brings out Master Luke and his lightsaber, and then bounces Dr. E &amp; Ponda. Things weren’t going as great as I thought. Anyways, that was a table-clearing battle, and I’m activating enough to bring out Vader and Tarkin in one turn. He deploys Lando w/ Ax and Undercover to block my drain at the Tatooine Docking Bay, and I immediately Hutt Smooch him. Every time I kill Luke he comes back for free. He flips to retrieve ten force, replaces Han Solo with Han w/ Blaster and plays Bo Shuda. For the rest of the game I end up battling to capture most of his characters, but when he has no one left to battle it’s over and I can’t win. Also, when I flip my objective, I end up having to lose one force each turn. I put down Sullest and Zuckess in Mist Hunter. I drain him for two for the rest of the game. Sadly, I lose because of my objective. If I had won just a few more battles I could have made it. Full loss by only 10.<br/>
Highs: Playing Dave, draining for two all game at Sullest.<br/>
Lows: losing to profit, that’s really all.<br/>
<br/>
I think around now A.J. Clemans comes up to us and tells me about his big loss. His light side deck lost around 40 force in one turn. Lateral Damage, All Power to Weapons, and 3,720 to 1 all contributed to him losing his game. I don’t want to explain any more.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My WYS vs Brian’s Black Sun<br/>
Ok, a game I can win if I play well. Brian’s one of my best friends, and I helped him build this deck. He starts with the signal and Presence of the Force, which flips his objective. It stays flipped for the rest of the game. He’s really excited about his starting hand, and I soon find out that it’s some Cloud City sites (he wanted to be different and play CC) and Bossk, Snoova, and Guri, I think. I had a nice hand featuring Captain Han and the Falcon. I keep control of Kessel and Tatooine Docking Bay. He captures a few of my characters, but I eventually place out of play his last best hope for space, Boba Fett in Slave I. I grin evilly. He places a bounty on Chewbacca, Protector, but he’s already lost All Wrapped Up to my drains. I forfeit Chewie, he loses a bunch with attrition. Eventually I end up winning by 14.<br/>
Highs: Playing a competitive game, placing out of play Boba Fett in Slave I, and winning my last game.<br/>
Lows: having to beat a good friend, never flipping back his objective.<br/>
<br/>
After the tournament’s all done and everything, I place tenth. I’m glad I didn’t get last place. I get a Jabba’s Palace Artoo in my prize support. All in all it was a good day, even though I lost three games.  </font></td>
