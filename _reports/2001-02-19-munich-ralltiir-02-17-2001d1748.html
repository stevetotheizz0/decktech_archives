<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Pretourney junk:<br/>
Me and my trainings buddy Julian Konrad arrived at 10am at Funtainment in Munich.<br/>
Nobody was there so we started playtesting a little bit cause neither him nor me were sure what to play.So I started WYS against his SYCFA-Scum@#$%.I got Falcon to Tatoiine with Captain and one Freighter Captain aboard and had flipped.In his turn he deployed like 3 BH-ships, ready to beatdown me(including Zuckuss).He battled I played I Know, deployed Leia he played Barrier.Well I had a Bith Shuffle/Desperate Reach card in my hand the whole time, but now it was gone!!!So thats game.<br/>
Finally a few other players arrive, with one of them carrying a Refl.2 Display.<br/>
It had been very expensive cause he bought it at another shop which is always expensive(idiot!!!).He pulls no UR and I traded him some junk for my 9th Outer Rim Scout.<br/>
Now it is time to look at my decks.I was sitting about half an hour just thinking about what to play.For dark I had Dueling-Hunt Down and MKOS.I managed to get a second Holonettr. so HD is the way to go.With 3 Visages, 2MM and 2 Holonets this would be fun.As you will see later I won´t play a Holonet in the hole tourney.<br/>
For light I took Throne-Room Mains which is strong enough to against my local opponents.<br/>
Finally the TD arrives and starts the tourney(4 rounds) and the prize support is foil Leia w/ gun for first and a lot of junk for others.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
My Hunt Down vs. Peyman Strapapapapi (a Turkish guy)<br/>
Well I was really looking forward for this matchup cause he played MWYHL to 6 last tourney and just didn´t want to believe that I would kick its @$$ with Hunt Down.<br/>
So we put our starting stuff out and I realize that he plays Local Uprising with Alderaan.WTF??? Okay this was an Auto-Win and I managed not to start laughing.I started deploying Palpy to Exe.: DB and he by deploying Crix with some scout to Swamp.If I had No Escape in my Deck as usual the game would have been over.Next turn I deployed Vader without Saber to CC.: Db and left some Force.He drains for 1 paying 3 for Battle Order, deploys one Alderaan operative and draws up.Down come Iggy, Ponda Evazan and Bobba kicking ass.we battle a little bit with him deploying Greeve and me deploying Mara without Saber.If he had been in my Reserve Deck, this would have probably been game.<br/>
Finally he deploys Farmboy Luke and EPP Leia to adjacent site and moves his last scrub away.I track a 5, 6, 7 with MM + Operational as Planed get Vader to hand and duel Luke next turn with Vader, Tarkin and a Focused Attack.Thats game.I drain him out and Visage damage does him in.<br/>
 FW +24<br/>
2 (+24)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: First Round win.<br/>
Lows: 8 cards on hand, when he draws his last card in Reserve Deck(Damn looser) and no real competition.<br/>
<br/>
So now I`m third of 10 people with only Dark Wins and a lot of timed wins.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
My Throneroom-Mains vs. Ian ????´s MKOS<br/>
I start Insurrection, Staging areas and YISMW.He starts Expand the Empire???, well he isn´t a bad player usual so I think this won´t be too easy we both start generating tons of force and drawing up.Then he deploys Jabba, 4-Lom, Bane Malar, Myo and 4 Abyssians to the Chamber.My turn I deploy Luke, JK with stick, Chewie P., Han w.Blaster, Leia and Corran down(no No Bargain) and want to clash Bane Malar.Sense?!? WTF???I sense also and he plays control.@#$%!!!Okay Chewie cancels 4-Loms gametext and I hit like 3 guys.We draw destiny.Finally he looses about 5 guys and I loose Corran.His turn he runs away cause I point out that I will reinforce next turn (little joke).From now on it becomes a drain race with him deploying Presence on Throne Room and Boba + Djas Puhr.I spread out to drain him for 8 a turn. He comes to my lonely Leia and Han.My turn battle, I Know his 4 guys die and my Leia w/ Saber (Anakins) survives.In end game I play Alter on Presence, retrieve 4 force for On the Edge and finally drain him out.<br/>
 FW +17<br/>
4 (+41)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning <br/>
Lows: Drawing Alter and On the Edge so late.<br/>
<br/>
Now I´m second with my friend loosing with his Speeder @#$% to a space Deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
My Throneroom-Mains vs. Christian ???´s Spacejizz<br/>
No!!! was my first thought, cause my only space was H1 with pilots and Lando and Falcon, but got a good hand(Ackbar + H1Warroom) and from now on the game was mine.I started deploying warroom + one DB from my deck and deploying Ackbar to it.He gets one Dreadnaught with 2 pilots and one Saber Squadron ship with pilot to Wakkeelmui(After both of us drawing and deploying locations a few turns).So after drawing I had finally Han + Leia + Hasshn(from Ackbar) + H1 (from this crappy effect) and 2 I Knows I battle his ships, which are now at Yavin 4.I play I Know and have a destiny of 17.I also have more power with Ackbar now at warroom and he has to forfeit a lot of ships.I recycle and have one card above my 4 cards with a total of 17.He deploys like 5 Intercepors and battles again.I sense his APTW and draw again a 17 with my second I Know.His army is little now and he hides at Kessel.I drain for 5 my next turn, with Jedi Luke w/stick aND Tawws Khaa at Tat.:DB. His turn he deploys Igar in T1, he gets a Barrier and 2 other scrubs.My turn I battle end he looses only the scrub (I had 3 4´s and 1 3 in my reserve Deck and draw 2 4´s for saber destinies and the 3 for destiny, damn!!!).I loose Tawws and reinforce with Corran from another DB and move my H1 to Kessel.His turn he deploys CHoke Vader and 3 other Scrubs to the DB.Barrier Vader and he has no Force left, so his little army is alone in space now, bad mistake.My turn I retrieve 4 force eith a tracked 5 and on the edge, deploy Lando in Falcon to the H1 battle and that´s game.<br/>
 FW +27<br/>
6 (+68)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating Space<br/>
Lows: Not beaing able to find OTE, and his bad mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Finally I´m in first and the only undefeated one.Some scrub has his 3rd timed game so the tourney takes time.I have to play Christian again cause he is in third now and the second one, JK has to play also dark now.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My Hunt Down vs. CHristian ???´s EBO<br/>
I spread out fast and drain a few turns before getting S&amp;D.He manages to deploy Obi Wan Kenobi with Saber and Chewie to Vaders site and wants to battle.You are beaten Obi, slice Chewie and draw a 1 for destiny, @#$%!!!He only looses 2 force and I manage to track to high destinies with Janus and stuff.Next turn duel Obi and from now on S&amp;D and Visage kills him.I hunt his last ships in space down and the last battle is my Bossk in Bus against hios X-Wing with a tracked 7.That´s game cause he had lost all his other evasion cards through drains or other space attacks.<br/>
 FW +25<br/>
8(+93)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning!!!<br/>
Lows: Beating him down cause his Deck had no chance.<br/>
<br/>
We are the first to end the game so I sat down to another match of my friend JK against some guys WYS.Well the scrub could have won nearly every round but he didn´t realize it <br/>
cause he is still drunk from last night so he looses.<br/>
<br/>
Final Standings:<br/>
<br/>
1. me 8 +93<br/>
2.JK 6 +??<br/>
3. some scrub 6 +??<br/>
<br/>
Don´t know the whole standing cause I played in another game after I got my Prize Support which was a Leia w/ Blaster foil.<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
Me for winning and getting Leia!!!<br/>
Our TD for giving nice Prize Support this time.<br/>
JK for getting 2nd finally after loosing to that bad Space Deck.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
That stupid drunken scrub for not winning.<br/>
No competition.<br/>
My scrub area.<br/>
A monthly tourney, that´s @#$%.<br/>
<br/>
