<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">hey, that WAS a real tournament, and just because it took place yesterday (wednesday) doesn’t mean jack sh1t.  alot of the kids around here have spring break from their high school, so one of the TD’s who happens to be a teacher decided to run a wednesday tournament.  that one is totally legit, and if you don’t think so, then check out the "tournaments" section on decipher.com.<br/>
