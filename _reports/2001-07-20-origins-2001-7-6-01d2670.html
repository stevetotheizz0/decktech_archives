<br/>
well i&amp;#8217;ll start back in june.  the pre registration deadline was like the 11th or something, so i signed up to go to<br/>
origins on saturday.  i&amp;#8217;m pretty sure friday will be a no-show since i have football weight lifting.  well then the end<br/>
of june coach tells us we have the week of the 4th of july off so i&amp;#8217;m going to origins.  thats cool but i have no decks<br/>
and have only played in 1 tourney since states and no tourneys since tatooine.  i make &amp;#8220;the pile&amp;#8221;, hidden mains,<br/>
and a qmc but they aren&amp;#8217;t really my style so i go to a mwyhl/racer/test 1/ direct damage (afa, legendary, orgder to<br/>
engage, ect) and play it like a total of 2 times vs my friends isb/hoth walker stuff and win by 22 and 5 , so i&amp;#8217;m like i<br/>
guess it will do and thats my ls deck.  for dark i had huntdown podracer but i keep hearing how it sucks so i don&amp;#8217;t<br/>
want to use it.  the avatar style e-ops deck looks pretty solid, and i&amp;#8217;ve played eops a lot before so i build it, change a<br/>
few things, and thats my dark deck.<br/>
<br/>
well i drive down to origins alone and am like 2 hours early incase there is a line.  there isn&amp;#8217;t.  in like 15 minutes i<br/>
get through registration and event sign up and so i go on over to the ccg hq place.  i meet up with a lot of people<br/>
and we talk decks and how are you doing and all that stuff but we&amp;#8217;re ready for the tourney to start.  we were<br/>
surprised that 2 of ohios big guns, brad chester and jamie abel, didn&amp;#8217;t show up for the open.  <br/>
<br/>
i&amp;#8217;m bad with names, sorry.<br/>
game 1.  dark vs ? hbx/mains/omdh<br/>
i start off fast and get in some good drains because of rumors.  we fight in space a few times but i waste him. so<br/>
next he tries to kill my walker with igar/veers in it at the endor db.  well imp command really helps me and i am<br/>
retreiving a lot with first strike.  attrition kills most of his guys so he goes at the bunker with reflections 2 luke and<br/>
kills a few guys but i beat on him.  i drain him out and win by 20ish.<br/>
fw 2 (+20?)<br/>
<br/>
game 2. light vs ? build the ds2 deck<br/>
hmm....bulid ds2.  i&amp;#8217;m not familiar with this deck type.  he gets out his sectors fast while i race and do some afa<br/>
action.  chybc comes out so i dont retrieve. i cant complete test 1 so his drains are big.  jarjar and epp obi pay<br/>
jerjerod a visit at the ds2 db and do some damage.  i put a guy in space and one at the podrace arena i think to get<br/>
by chybc.  the mega falcon tries to beatdown but he gets 2 destinies from tto so all my stuff dies too.  then i put luke<br/>
r someone at the endor db where he has a bunch of guys.  he goes for a beatdown but i think i on the edge to<br/>
suicide luke, then jedis resiliance to get him back in my hand.  one of the guys he brought was vader who gets uc<br/>
furied which is big.  close game but i pull it out.<br/>
fw 4 + oh well foget diff.<br/>
<br/>
game 3. dark vs a wys beatdown.  <br/>
i drain in space and he does on ground.  i put out a uc spy which helps.  i have like nothing on land and he is out<br/>
draining me.  he spreads 2 smugglers to the endor db and that changes the game.  i drop a walker, guy, trample 1<br/>
smuggler, battle, he loses a lot.  he has manace fades out so that slows my drains.  he goes for a beatdown with the<br/>
trippler but forgts about dash till after we draw battle destiny so its too late.  that was big.  with his one shot at a<br/>
beatdown gone he didn&amp;#8217;t have much left and i won by mabey 3 or 4.<br/>
fw +6<br/>
<br/>
game 4.  light vs matrin paquette bhbm/racer.<br/>
let me say right now he had the worst luck ever and things would have been a lot dofferent if he didn&amp;#8217;t.  his racer<br/>
destinies are like tat db (his only bg i think) , a vader, and other stuff.  he does a hit racer on me though so i&amp;#8217;m<br/>
losing a lot of force to stack race destinies.  i think he put out chybc on me too.  i win the race.  he gets out vader so<br/>
i give him luke (and a fury i think) and i toss down a guy to a site so i can retrieve a little.  afa hurts him all game. <br/>
it was a good game but i managed to pull it out.<br/>
fw +8<br/>
<br/>
game 5. light vs a bhbm 7&amp;#8217;s deck<br/>
this guy was a tracking machine and his deck had mad higfh destiny.  i win the race and for the first time all day<br/>
get to retrieve from it.  well his deck is like the old bhbm &amp;#8220;machine&amp;#8221; decks, guys at db&amp;#8217;s, search and destroy, ect. <br/>
he also has chiraneau at cardia so he is draining 6 a turn.  well i d test 1 but melas gets set for stun.  that really hurt<br/>
me.  i start dropping guys to podrace arena to get by s&amp;d, but every turn he kills them with his high destinies.  i<br/>
setup a kessel drain late game but its not enough. lose by 2<br/>
fl +8<br/>
<br/>
game 6. dark vs alex klammrodt qmc.<br/>
well this is not cool.  the guy who made qmc popular with his trademark deck.  and i&amp;#8217;m playing his dark eops deck. <br/>
well i try to take bespin and hold it for a while.  i do some decent damage but pucimir answers that.  he sets up<br/>
menace fades and that slows me big time.  he shoots my uc spy.  not much else i can do, i can&amp;#8217;t handle 9 drain a<br/>
turn when i cant keep spys alive or setup decree.  he doesnt retrieve all game and still wins by like 19.<br/>
fl +8<br/>
<br/>
after that game we sat there a while and talked about stuff and he gave me some tips for the e-ops deck. he was<br/>
really cool. thanks a lot man.<br/>
<br/>
game 7. dark vs martin paquette wys beats<br/>
well he gets his revenge.  like the other game vs wys i had, i take space early and wait for him to attack. he power<br/>
pivots chimaera but i don&amp;#8217;t lose any overflow.  he is playing all these crazy interrupts twice since he has wys.  i<br/>
made a mistake i tried to tallon roll a ship but forgot battle deployment made my ship power -2.  darn.  he uses that<br/>
ship to drain me in space.  his deck was pretty good and so he won.<br/>
fl +8<br/>
<br/>
game 8.  light vs john veasy big blue isb.<br/>
i win the race and afa hurts him.  i use it could be worse on a lot of his endor/sullust drains.  we fight in space and<br/>
the mega falcon kills off a lot of stuff.  i put a guy at podracer arena to take advantage of i did it.  i do a vosired<br/>
vision for imp command, and see all 4 he has, so he lose all of them.  that was big.  somehow he kills han and leia<br/>
from the falcon.  i have luke at the podrace arena, so i on the edge him, then jedis resiliance and get him into hand,<br/>
and then play him on the falcon.  we fight and i play legendary starfighter ( i found out after the game that i<br/>
couldn&amp;#8217;t have pleyed it cause i didn&amp;#8217;t win the battle, man i&amp;#8217;m sorry john. the way i look at it though you still would<br/>
have had to lose to order to engage here and there but i think the game would have been a lot closer, sorry man.) <br/>
well time is about up so i land the falcon on dag swamp to get 4 cards back in my deck.  i would have gotten a<br/>
timed win but john draws up to give me a full win. that guy is cool.<br/>
fw +10<br/>
<br/>
well i finish 5-3 and get my barrier foil. i pull an ai maul out of my tatooine pack so thats cool.  the next few hours<br/>
i rumble around looking for food while aaron and paul (the people who let me stay in there room) play in teds<br/>
tourney.  at like 12 we leave and by 1 we find our hotel thats 3 blocks from the con.  i go to sleep but they swim. <br/>
<br/>
next morning we get up at like 8 or 9 and by 11 are ready to go back to the con.  they play some sw but i&amp;#8217;m only<br/>
doing rawdeal today.  i play in the hardcore tourney ald lose a lot but win some too.  i played tj holman and clint<br/>
hays and they kick my @#$% in raw deal.  i decide not to stay for the raw deal open and drive home.  <br/>
<br/>
