<br/>
 I had travelled quite a long way to get to this tournament although I do have friends and<br/>
 family in this region of Sweden. <br/>
     The night before I exchanged an alter for R-3PO in my Tosche Mains deck and decided<br/>
 not to include the Savrip. For my dark side I brought my Step down the Jedi, but it has been<br/>
 modified once again. In other words I brought two decks that I like to play and that might<br/>
 have chance against most decks if luck is on my side. So I burnt an Ewok to Odins honour<br/>
 and prayed for good fortune.<br/>
     I arrived to the place just before 18.30 and met an impressive amount of people compared<br/>
 to the tournaments in my area. 12 people showed up and a bunch of them were rather new to<br/>
 the game. I talked a bit with the peolpe who I only had had email communication with before.<br/>
 They all seemed really nice. On to the games: <br/>
<br/>
 1. DS vs. Ivan Markus' Cloud City pot purri.<br/>
     This was his first swiss tournament in years and when he started with a 2/1 CC site and<br/>
 Planned for the Incinerator I figured I should have a chance. I had three Vaders in my<br/>
 opening hand and threw one down first turn. He deployed Kessel and ***What Is Your<br/>
 Bidding My Master (!)*** and deployed Biggs and Momaw Nadon against Vader. I hit<br/>
 Biggs and lost a few to battle damage. He didn't move Momaw so I hit him with Vader,<br/>
 AT-ST Pilot, Dr E and Focused Attack. He lost 17 force I think. He then went to space with<br/>
 GL in G1 and got one drain in at Kessel before it was hit by the bus and a Dreadnaught. He<br/>
 lost a lot in that battle too and it was all over in ten or fifteen minutes. <br/>
<br/>
 Conclusion: I don't really like winning with this much against a newbie, but he seemed like a<br/>
 great sportsman and didn't seem to mind. I guess everything worked out the way I wanted<br/>
 with a bit of luck.<br/>
 Result:FW +39 <br/>
 Record: 2(+39) <br/>
<br/>
 2. LS vs. Emil Wallin's ISB Dark Deal.<br/>
 He drew a lot of cards. I let Ben pick up some power converters and began looking for<br/>
 DTF/Frozen Assets. When he flipped the objective and set up Dark Deal I had the EPP mob,<br/>
 DTF and Frozen Assets (only have one of each(!)) in my hand. Some wimpy Imperial got<br/>
 smacked for 14 force. I then spread out on CC and Nabruned Obi over (IAO was out). Next<br/>
 turn I managed to flip back his objective. I had the game in my hand from then on and<br/>
 became a bit too cocky. A drain of 4 slipped by my mains and EPP Leia got hit by a bunch of<br/>
 ISBs. I did win in the end however. <br/>
 Conclusion: Emil was a very nice guy. His deck is deadly so I guess I was kind of lucky to<br/>
 win. Result:FW +20 <br/>
 Record: 4(+59) <br/>
<br/>
 3. LS vs. Bert-Olof Lundin's Rendili Stardrive.<br/>
 Obi and Luke had a constant drain of three on the ground while Han, Leia in the Falcon and<br/>
 GL in G1 with a Landing Claw had some control over space. He had a hard time finding his<br/>
 systems and when he got them I had a rather big advantage. Two Grimtaash got rid of seven<br/>
 cards and his massive spacefleet was crippled. Conclusion: B-O was yet another great guy<br/>
 and we had a lot of fun playing. The landing Claw was very useful. Result:FW +28 Record:<br/>
 6(+87) <br/>
<br/>
 4. DS vs. B-O's Ralltiir Freighter Captains with Asteroid Sanctuaries and Kessel Runs.<br/>
 He started Local uprising on Ralltiir. I knew he was playing with Sanctuaries, but figured it<br/>
 would be cheating to start with Come Here You Big Coward. This match was yet again just a<br/>
 matter of my extreme luck. First turn I got Vader to his Farm and Altered his Bargaining<br/>
 table. He lost an Asteroid Field from reserve deck and I went looking for CHYBC. He got in<br/>
 one sanctuary before I found it. I deployed some AT-ST stuff to Endor: Forest Clearing and<br/>
 had a constant drain of 5. He tried a Kessel Run -I drew a site. He tried to occupy two<br/>
 battlegrounds -I came down with Executor, Tarkin, AT-ST pilot and Vader's Shuttle.<br/>
 Everything I wanted came into my hand. Any deck would have a hard time against someone<br/>
 with that luck. Conclusion: Basically a matter of luck. I'm still in the lead, but still no<br/>
 self-confidence... Result:FW +34 <br/>
 Record: 8(+121) <br/>
<br/>
 5. DS vs. Magnus Larsson's Force Choke.<br/>
 I thought I would at least have a chance with my three Evaders. He revolved first turn and<br/>
 put a Nudj on his farm. I had Vader, Hoth: Def Per and JP in my starting hand so I got a<br/>
 good activation rather quickly. Vader came down to Def Per on my second turn. He revolved<br/>
 it and attacked with EPP Obi, Kal and some other punks. I lost from the reserve. I lost<br/>
 Masterful Move among others which might have cost me the game. Next turn Obi hit Vader<br/>
 and I lost another Vader from reserve. He deployed Mantellian Savrip and kept forfeiting<br/>
 things from his hand when Vader came down. He activated a lot and could track his<br/>
 destinies and my Vaders kept going to my lost pile. I never got a chance to duel his jedis<br/>
 which was my last hope. Conclusion: great game with lots of joking, yet very concentrated.<br/>
 Magnus is a very good player and he won quite easy. If I win my next game against him I<br/>
 win the tournament. Result:FL -18 <br/>
 Record: 8(+103) <br/>
<br/>
 6. LS vs. same Magnus' Yavin IV occupation.<br/>
 He deployed some locations and drew. I got EPP Luke to Tosche Station and drew. We both<br/>
 played very defensive. I get Ben to his companion Luke. I activate a lot now. He plays a<br/>
 Monnok I can't Sense since he has grabbed my Senses. Three Sense and two Obis are lost I<br/>
 think. Eventually he deploys a Dreadnaught and a pilot to Yavin IV. RL get attached to it's<br/>
 hull. He deploys Vader and Tarkin and deploys Rebel Base Occupation. I attack with Han<br/>
 and Leia and Orri. A tracked 5 shot Tarkin down and another 5 got rid of Vader. He lost<br/>
 some, but was soon back with Blizzard 2 with pilot at one site and Vader at the Forest.<br/>
 Imperial Arrest Order was out, so I had no chance of hitting him big again. I revolved the<br/>
 forest and Attacked EPP Vader with Han and Webb. Han survived and accompanied Leia<br/>
 and Orri. He deployed some imperials. I came down with Chewie, R-3PO and Beezer and<br/>
 almost cleared the site. I then moved Han to Chewie and Leia and Orri held another site. By<br/>
 this time I had lost a lot to RB Occupation and he had lost a lot of his starships. The clock<br/>
 was ticking. There was a crowd around us. We kept joking although it was such a tense<br/>
 game. I sped up, he did the same. I took a chance and took Han and Chewie up to Yavin IV<br/>
 in the Falcon. I figured that if I could cancel RB Occupation I would win the game. With<br/>
 tracked destinies I managed to do this and when I finally found one of my Tunnel Visions<br/>
 and could get one of my two Nabruns (which I hadn't seen for the whole game) to move Ben<br/>
 and Luke to a Yavin site I knew I was going to win. Time was running out though. I drained<br/>
 as quickly as I could and altered my LS Proficency for some greedy reason. He had ONE<br/>
 force left and I went to my control phase and said: <br/>
 'Force dr...rrrrriiiiiing!!'. The stupid clock rang before I had finished the sentence! I had to<br/>
 put my cards down and see myself beaten by the clock. A timed win put me in third place<br/>
 instead of first and I could do nothing but smile. I was the one who had been slow and it<br/>
 was my greed (altering LS Prof) who brought me down. Magnus had sped up too and I had<br/>
 no one to blame but myself. The Tournament Director: Hans Karlsson did the right thing<br/>
 when judging the timed win. Conclusion: a fantastic game. I didn't care about not winning<br/>
 and was happy with my third place. My luck didn't last (guess I need to have a talk with<br/>
 Odin), but my good mood sure did. Result:TW +18 <br/>
 Record: 9(+121) <br/>
<br/>
 Final Conclusion: Emil Wallin won (again!) and Magnus Larsson finished in second place.<br/>
 I think this was the best tournament I've ever attended. I met great peolpe, played<br/>
 interesting games, didn't get a parking ticket on my mother's car, got a Falcon in my price<br/>
 and finished in third place out of twelve. <br/>
 The only annoying thing I can think of just now is that Lund is about 450 miles from my<br/>
 hometown... <br/>
