<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is my tournament report from C+B Cards and Comics in Oxford where I was being a scrub like usual. <br/>
<br/>
Pre-Tourney Stuff:<br/>
Well, all week I was planning my decks and changing what I wanted to play. First I wanted to play QMC but I had too many cards so I didn’t play that. Next I wanted to play Hidden Mains or an awesome Hidden Base but it just didn’t feel right. I settled on AITC speeders but wanted to change for some reason. So I decided to play EB GhettO which stuck super Home One at Kiffex and drained, and put Jedi Luke, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon on the ground. It was very cool. Anyway Edwin came over to spend the night Friday and we made decks most of the time while my little bro was annoying us. By the way he is 8 and is like a child prodigy at Star Wars, thinking up decks that are just wicked, and tracking. Hmmmm, when your little bro can track and you can’t (well I can, but I just screw it up a lot, and he doesn’t) that means something is wrong. Anyway we were making decks and I was gonna go with Hunt Down Duel, but I decided to change to a Maul Mains drain at the palace. Anyway Edwin slightly modified his WYS and AOTBS from last tourney. I play against him with my light and beat him by 3. Then we’re like let’s go to bed cuz its 12:30 and we’re tired, but we decide to modify his WYS and I play it with my Maul Mains but get my a$$ whooped. I have a sore throat and a runny nose but I’m still gonna go. We go to bed at 2 and wake up at 7:30 so we’re ready to go with 5 and a half hours of sleep. Edwin looks a little like a zombie but we’re okay. We fool around in the morning and finally eat breakfast at 10 and then leave around 10:45. We go to Edwin’s house to get some cards and drop off his stuff. We then drive to Oxford and my bro is like punching me on my knee where I have a big scrape from playing hockey. So that sucks but we get there in plenty of time and we see all these people but no Adam or Mike, and there supposed to be coming, then they show up and talk to the SC state champion who just moved here and we get underway. The store is small with a huge gameroom where we talk to Team Just Bring It, Brian, his friend, Ryan Obman, and Greyson Thompson. I get 2 Coruscant Packs and pull P-60 and You have ballz to come back here. I put P-60 and Xixor I borrowed from Mike in my dark. Now onto the games.<br/>
<br/>
First Game: My DS Maul Mains vs. Ryan Obeman’s QMC (1669)<br/>
Well, he is one of the better players in our area but I think I can beat him for some reason. Well I start Landing Site and JP with Combat Readiness. He starts QMC Leia’s Quarters, and HFTMF with KTEOF, Squad Ass., and some other effect that I forget. I get Maul and Mara in hand so on my first turn I put Maul at his site and Mara to JP with her stick and move over Maul. Ryan deploys Obi w/Stick and Artoo and Threepio to the Drain Cancelling site which he deployed that turn. On my turn I drain of 2 and get out another JP site. He gets ships to Bespin and Menace Fades working. He puts Qui-Guy at a site and I decide to kick his a$$ so bad he won&amp;#8217;t be able to sit down. I drop P-60, Destroyer Droid, Dengar w/Gun, and Roofoo and Ponda Boba, but he Paths. Crap! O well, some how I knew he was gonna do that. Next turn he deploys EPP Leia to my site, Luke to Qui-Guy&amp;#8217;s, and moves Qui-Guy, EPP Ben, and Artoo and Threepio over to my site. I drain, and battle him. I should have known about Run, Luke Run which he played. @#$%!!!! I shoot Artoo and Threepio with Destroyer Droid and operate, he loses one. Tight. He slashes Roofoo and his hommie. I shoot at Luke w/ P-60, no dice. He cuts Dengar. I shoot Leia with Dengar, no dice. He shoots at Destroyer droid, got &amp;#8216;em. I shoot at Leia with the Boomstick, 5! Finally I hit someone else and operate. He played Skywalkers earlier so his 3 are 6, 1, and 2. My 2 are 1 and 1. Crap. I forfeit everyone and that satifies. He plays Celebration, which I cancel with Endor Occupation. I am draining at the palace, but he is draining for two much and his retrieval with On/Off the Edge is too much for me, and he wins by 17. FL by 17<br/>
0(-17)<br/>
Highs: Umm, quick start mebbe? Cancelling Celebration with Occupation?<br/>
Lows: Ugg, I don&amp;#8217;t even want to think about it. Path, Run, Luke Run, Skywalkers, among others.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My Light, EB GhettO Racing vs. Edwin Harris&amp;#8217;s AOTBS Makurth Beatdown (1586)<br/>
Well we played this game last night and I won, so we are both like Edwin you are gonna scrub out cuz 0-2 start sucks. Well somehow, his deck works really well, and he wins by 25. Anyway, during the game I get my drain going at Kiffex, but he invades the Echo Base and kills off my mains. I got a good start, but somewhere along the way, my deck just died. I don&amp;#8217;t know why, but it just died. He won the race, and was just way out draining me. FL by 25<br/>
0 (-42)<br/>
Highs: A good start mebbe?<br/>
Lows: Everything<br/>
<br/>
Well, I learn I have the bye so I am pissed. I hate byes. Anyway, I pull up a chair to watch Edwin&amp;#8217;s AOTBS demolish Greyson.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Bye: Edwin&amp;#8217;s AOTBS vs. Greyson&amp;#8217;s WYS<br/>
Edwin starts out flipped, so Greyson loses 2 first turn. They are both racing, so Edwin initiates the race, flashes Anikin, and is off with a 0 which Sebulba makes a 3. Greyson sets up in space at Kessel, and Edwin is just draining on the ground on Coruscant and the Cantina. Greyson deploys Chewie, Protector to the Cantina, which Edwin barriers. He then deploys Han w/Gun, but he realizes Captain Han is piloting the Falcon already. So he deploys Luke instead and its Edwin&amp;#8217;s turn. He drains and they race. I think Edwin draws Palpy. Edwin drops a couple Makurths, a Vigo, and a disruptor pistol. He battles, shoots Chewie, he&amp;#8217;s lost. Greyson swings at Vigo, but he misses. Edwin screams, draws high, Greyson draws low. Greyson loses the battle and a little more. On his turn, he drains and lets Edwin go. They race, and Edwin wins. They retrieve and lose. On Greyson&amp;#8217;s turn, he drops Chewie with Gun alone at a DB. This proved to be the key point in losing the game. Edwin drops Boba Fett w/Gun, a couple Makurths, Guri, and battles. Greyson shoots with Chewie, nope. Edwin shoot with Fett, no also. Edwin screams twice, draws 6 and 5 to power, and a tracked 7 for destiny. Greyson doesn&amp;#8217;t get one, and the 18 battle damage finishes him off. Edwin FW by 25<br/>
<br/>
I&amp;#8217;m sorry if I didn&amp;#8217;t get all of the details correct, as I was not playing in this game. <br/>
Anyway:<br/>
Game 4: My DS Maul Mains vs. Brian Pearce (scrubbish friend of Brian our friend from other tourneys) (couldn&amp;#8217;t find rating)<br/>
Well, I have to say he gets a really bad start, and I get a really good one. I start draining right away and he drops a lone someone I forget at the Cantina. I drop Xixor and Dr. E combo and battle, kill him. I start draining there and everywhere else. I draw until I have reactor terminal, and about 20 cards in hand, deploy it, but he draws up. Crap. O well <br/>
FW by 25<br/>
4 (-17)<br/>
Highs: Total board control<br/>
Lows: I feel sorry for this guy getting raped the way he did at this tourney. Also, drawing too much. If I hadn&amp;#8217;t I would have won by like 35.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I go and watch some games and talk to some guys and I figure out I&amp;#8217;m playing against Alex Devito, the best local player even though he&amp;#8217;s a scrub.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My Light vs. Alex Devito&amp;#8217;s ISB (1589)<br/>
He starts the senate, and Prepped defenses for some things. I start my racing as usual, and ANSB. I get a pretty good start. First turn he drops a senator to the senate for a drain of 1 which I eat all game. My turn I get some sites and aliens down to the base. He deploys Vader with his stick to the Cantina. I deploy Jedi Luke, Saber at the ready to pick a fight. I swing, get him, he swings and misses. I draw high, so does he but I&amp;#8217;m immune, he&amp;#8217;s not so he has to lose 2 and eat a drain of 3 for a while. On his turn, he drains, I think about losing Houjix from hand but don&amp;#8217;t. This proved to be a key point. He is really mad, so he drops Tatooine system, sunsdown, and about 600 ISB agents for free and Maul and battles. I calmly cut Maul, and draw a 5 and 5, he draws 0 and 2, and he Takeels the 2 for 5,  so he has power 65 to my 15. I forfeit Luke and lose 40 more and that&amp;#8217;s game. Just kidding. I houjix for 40 and it&amp;#8217;s my turn. I deploy Home One with Ackbar to Kiffex, and Independence to Tatooine for a drain of 9 total. He is draining of 5 or 6, but I drop EPP Obi to the 4th marker to drain. I win the race on his last turn, so I get six back and he loses. FW by 26<br/>
6 (+9)<br/>
<br/>
Well now it&amp;#8217;s the last game and I&amp;#8217;m getting tired and hungry. I have to play someone good now for some reason (I always have to play someone good in my last game).<br/>
<br/>
My DS vs. Caleb Foth HB Flip (1623)<br/>
I get a quick start and he doesn&amp;#8217;t. He is expecting space from me early so he conserves his resources. He drops the forest, Menace Fades, and EPP Luke there. On my next turn I drain, and drop Xixor, P-60, and Dengar w/Boomstick. I battle, miss Luke, and he misses Xixor. I draw Ozzel, so Luke stays, but he has to lose 6, because he gets no destiny. On his turn he drops Corran, and battles, hits Xixor, and I hit Corran w/Dengar&amp;#8217;s Boomstick. I draw a 1 and he forfeit Corran and EPP Luke and plays a Jedi&amp;#8217;s Resilience. I didn&amp;#8217;t want to mess my chance of winning this game up, so I didn&amp;#8217;t tell him that his forest made his people immune until my turn. I drain but he cancels 2 as he just flipped. I back up the Droideka with Guri and Elephant Mon (J) and he goes. He drains for lots and from then on there no interaction with him draining and me draining, but he wins because of stupid drain cancellation and undercover spies. FL by 2<br/>
6 (+7)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Almost winning. One more turn I would have won by Snipering Boussh and draining him out. <br/>
Lows: Going 3 and 3 AGAIN!!! When will I ever learn. <br/>
<br/>
Well Caleb tells me to put in space and I&amp;#8217;m like ya so I decide to keep these decks. Anyway prizes are handed out and I get 12 out of 22 which isn&amp;#8217;t horrible but isn&amp;#8217;t good. Edwin gets 5th which rules. The SC state champion who just moved here wins, and that isn&amp;#8217;t good cuz we don&amp;#8217;t like people just moving here and pushing us around. jkJ<br/>
Anyway Edwin pulls a Coruscant Maul in his prize support and trades it to the winner for a Tat. Maul. Me and Edwin have a two person team and so do Carson and Lewis, so we ask them if they want to combine teams and they&amp;#8217;re like ok. So we do but we haven&amp;#8217;t thought of a team name yet. On the way home we eat dinner at Wendy&amp;#8217;s and I don&amp;#8217;t eat much. We talk about team names and hiku&amp;#8217;s. Edwin thinks our team name should be either Team Flying Fish and Taco People or Team Cactapus (a mixture between a cactus and an octopus, a cactus with tentacles). I like Cactapus, or Team Salacious Crumbs. Heehee. We also talk about what would happen if an evil scientist crossbred Poison Ivy, Rosebushes, and Kudzu, so that it would be prickly poison ivy that would grow everywhere very rapidly. When I get home I go straight to bed cuz I&amp;#8217;m really tired and hungry but don&amp;#8217;t want to eat. I wake up in the middle of the night feeling sick and hungry, but I still don&amp;#8217;t want to eat. I almost throw up and I finally get back to sleep. In the morning I wake up and I am like I&amp;#8217;m sick, so I hang out at home and take some medicine to make me sleep and I take a nap. Anyway, I don&amp;#8217;t think you want to hear about my whole life leading up to this point, so here&amp;#8217;s the props and slops. <br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
-Edwin for doing well<br/>
-Mike for letting me borrow the Xixor that almost won my last game for me.<br/>
-Me, for finally making decks I like<br/>
-Carson for being cool and for joining our team with Lewis<br/>
-Houjix for being absolutely THE coolest card in Star Wars. <br/>
-Everyone who came for being cool<br/>
-Mr. Wilson, my Social Studies teacher, for being absolutely the coolest teacher ever<br/>
-Henry for opening his can of whoop-a$$ from last tourney on an unsuspecting opponent<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
-Me for not eating or sleeping when I was sick<br/>
-Minor Slop to the TD for being a little too enthusiastic about Jason and Adam playing each other in the second game when they weren&amp;#8217;t supposed to and when they really didn&amp;#8217;t want to<br/>
<br/>
So another scrub finish, but I think with a little tweaking, I&amp;#8217;ll go 4-2 soon. Until next time,<br/>
The future world champion, Philip<br/>
