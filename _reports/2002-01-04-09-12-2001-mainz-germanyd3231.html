09.12.2001 Mainz/Germany<br/>
<br/>
it was just a long, hard but great weekend for me, 2 tournaments in 2 days!!!! i pulled out the TR of the first<br/>
tournament, and this is the second one! we were 18 players, and the first price was a new foil maul with stick!!!<br/>
damn, i’ve never saw this card before, and i hoped and praied that i win the tournament. so check my report :<br/>
<br/>
my decks :<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
light side : pod profit, (mixed up with ruf podracin’)<br/>
<br/>
dark side : court of the vile ... also mixed up with podracin’<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Game light side vs. andreas flachsbart (hunt down) <br/>
<br/>
ok, the first game against andreas and his "weak" hunt down, i just played my old school Pod Profit style, <br/>
pulled out 3PO With His Parts ...  with "seeking in the audience" and deployed "a gift" from reserve deck with the<br/>
shield "don’t do that again", so no drains on tatooine for me, and i canceld his Mob Pionts, he just activate 9 force <br/>
each turn, and after my second turn i pulled out goo nee tay, he wasn’t able to deploy 2 characters together, cause <br/>
every vader costed 8 and each maul 9 force, 1 master luke and "double agent" against jade cleaned up the chamber, i killed <br/>
jade with 3PO and use master luke’s gametext to kill Jabba, so the chamber was clean and i was able to retrieve 10 force <br/>
and i payed nothing for that cause he don’t play a f.uckin’ secret plans. the game was perfect, i deployed all my mains, to <br/>
tatooine win the race and gave him a direct damage of 7 and higher each turn, so after 15 minutes the game was over and the <br/>
result was :<br/>
<br/>
FW +26  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Game dark side vs. nico kreidel (watch your step)<br/>
<br/>
the tournamnet started great for me, so i just looked at my next opponent and that was Nico, i ’ve played agianst him<br/>
the day before, and i hoped he didn’t changed his very nice WYS deck, and he didn’t changed it! i played my <br/>
court mixed up with podrace, and after 1 turn, i pulled out gailid, all my 3 jabba sites and have a race destiny of 8, <br/>
so the game started perfect for me. he just play the basic stuff, like outrider into space and the red 10 pilot with x-cannon,<br/>
so i tried to get the cantina with jade, IG-88 and 2 imperial barriers, and it worked. i barried his skywalker one turn later he <br/>
just deployed a han with gun, and so i barrierd that guy, the next turn i pull out Colo Claw Fish and a 5 on it, so i battled<br/>
captured luke immediatley with IG-88 and hit han with Jade and gave him a little beat down. moved out with IG-88 and skywalker was <br/>
out of play for the whole game! after he has lost some small battles at the chamber with his Palace Raiders, he concentrate his<br/>
ability to the space and drained me for 4 every turn, but after i deployed zuckuss with 4-lom to space, he tried to kick my ass<br/>
with the x-cannon, but it didn’t work, after 5 or 6 turns i won the race, retrieved 11 force gave him a direct damage of 11<br/>
force and the game was already over, he had just 4 or 5 life force, and the next drain of mine gave him the rest, so :<br/>
<br/>
FW +30<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

3. Game light side vs. achim günzel (suckin’ watto)<br/>
<br/>
my 3rd game, and the tournamnet gets better and better, but now i played against a suckin’ watto deck, and against <br/>
achim guenzel!!! i don´t like this deck, cause it’s just to fast for me! so look at the first turn of achim and then please <br/>
tell me what da hell should i do if i ever play again such a watto deck!!! he pulled out jabba’s palace, overdeployed <br/>
my palace, deploy the chamber, overdeployed my chamber, played watto from hand, deployed the suckin beggar cancler to mos espa<br/>
and now the best he deployed search and destroy and tatooine occuption of course with the f.uckin system!!! the game was over after<br/>
it already started!! after the first turn, i activate 7 force, and he gave me every turn a direct damage of 8!!! i just tried <br/>
to deploy my 3PO and to win the race!!! but i had no chance against this fast deck, he battled my @ss with maul and his double<br/>
sucked lightsaber and gave me da real beat down with vader and the new boba fett, so the result and my first lose :<br/>
<br/>
FL -16<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
4. Game dark side vs. christian wilbs (quiet minin’ colony)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ok, 3 games, and 1 lost game, but it wasn’t a shame, cause achim told me that was the best starting hand he ever had!!!!!<br/>
so i hoped to kick his @ss again in the final game!!! but first i played again chris, and chris was a ruf player, he is just<br/>
one of the most boring tracker of da motha.@#$%in’ world, i was frightend we will have a time trial, and so i will have no chance to go to the <br/>
finals!! and the game started bad!!! he played the QMC deck with the typical suckin’ winkelhaus style, but he played it good!<br/>
after i deployed my gailid to chamber in the first turn, he deployed his corran horn, but i barrierd him, and kicked his ass<br/>
out of the chamber with Prince Xizor, so i thought the game will go on and on! but then he flipped his objective with <br/>
ten numb superstar deployed mence fades, pucumir and EPP leia, with a bespin celebration, and i had almost no chance!!<br/>
then i made a suicide, i deployed only one jade with stick to cloud city, and he gave me a beat down, with path least ..., help me<br/>
obi wan kenobi, EPP luke and the new Lando, he hit my jade draw destiny of 10 and i lost over 16 cards in one battle, the game was over<br/>
i tried everything but no way for me! i lost the game!!! and the tournament!! <br/>
<br/>
FL -12<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
5. Game dark side vs. mike million (quiet minin’ colony)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
my 5th game and i knew i had no chance to win the maul, so i just played to get some more ranking points for the decipher <br/>
ranking list!!! my opponent was mike, mike million and he played also a damn suckin’ QMC but against him the game was totaly different<br/>
i started like all my games gailid startin’ to the audience chamber and drained him for 2 every turn! he concentrate his power to cloud city, <br/>
and started to deploy EPP leia and luke to flip his objective, and i just waited that he lost all his ships, cause i had a <br/>
zuckuss in my starting hand, and every QMC player loses his ships after 6 or 7 turns cause he thinks the space battle for bespin<br/>
system is over!!! but i just waited, and then after i had won the race, and he had just 1 dash with outrider in space i <br/>
tried my best! i pulled out colo claw fish with a 5 and battled his @ss with zuckuss and finally i kicked him from bespin!<br/>
and now things go their way, i cancled his bespin celebration and deploy my battle order, and so the game was over and finally :<br/>
<br/>
FW +8<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
6. Game light side vs. mike million (quiet minin’ colony)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
my last game, after 6 hours star wars gamblin’ i just wanna go home and eat something! but i had to play agianst mike million,<br/>
he played the suckin’ bring him for me! and the whole game was to beat him in the chamber!!!!!! he deployed prince xizor and<br/>
boba fett starting so it took me some battles, and some jedi’s resilience to clean the chamber, but he deployed every turn a new<br/>
main like maul or vader, but with colo claw fish and my bacta tank, i just killed alwyays the biggie mains, the only think that<br/>
stressed me was emporer’s power, and his f.ucking high dests, so it took me over an half hour to clean the chamber, win my race<br/>
and to flip my objective, but after i flipped my obj. the game was over, i gave him a direct damage of 5 and highre, he lost all his mains <br/>
and so i was able to drain him in the cantina with a chewie, and the last game ended with :<br/>
<br/>
FW +18<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
