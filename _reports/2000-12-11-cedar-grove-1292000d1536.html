<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">     I left at 10:00 AM and my wife drove me up to Perkins at the junction of Route 33 and Interstate 80 and dropped me off there. I was originaly was going to drive up myself but at the last minuite she decided she was going to go Christmas shopping and hence she got the car. Once there I met up with the group from Mazz Cards at Clarks summit. Joe G., the eventual winner, Pat Ziagos and Brian Kennedy. from there we drove out to Cedar Grove and stopped at Hooters for lunch. Nothing spectacular there except inflated prices and a story why Brian has a tatoo of a dragon on his chest. I was also happy I was able to purchase an R2 in Red 5 for $2.00 once at Time Warp Comics. <br/>
<br/>
The Good: My wife letting me go to Hooters without a fit and trusting me. <br/>
     The Hooters Menu It’s a riot.<br/>
     Friendly Waitresses. <br/>
The Bad: Missing our turn at Cedar Grove and ending up on Route 290. <br/>
     Orange shorts on the waitresses The owner could have chosen a more flattering color.<br/>
     Being the only married man there :)<br/>
The Ugly: counting my Dark Deck on the way down and realizing I left three cards at home.<br/>
<br/>
     My decks were LS MWYHL and starting The way of Things Wise Advice and Squadron Assignments. I had no battlegrounds in my deck I thought I had enough power to smack down on thier battlegrounds and rest it from them. I also had the typical AFA and Yoda Stew. Due to collection restraints I had only 1 DoS more on this later. My plan was to find the weak point attack it early which MWYHL doesn’t do and be generaly agressive. I anticipated maybe a profit deck and Agents in the Court Being it’s a new objective and MWYHL or an EBO deck there so I Built a Tatooine Occupation Deck that would start Tatooine and combat readiness for Jabbas Palace pulling a majority of my sites early and using Hidden Weapons to make up for the low destiny in my deck. Vs. MWYHL and EBO I was planninng to play Prepared Defenses Secret Plans Power of a Hutt and Resistance. Secret Plans for retrieval both have Resistance for limiting force loss and Power of a Hutt to pull Hutt influence to protect my drains on Tatooine. <br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Steve Hidden Base X wing Swarm <br/>
<br/>
     I started combat readiness I signaled early for Power of a Huttand put Ephont Mon and Mara at the Audience Chamber. I then Hutt influence to protect my drains. I got Security Precautions in my hand early as well as the executor. I waited for him to flip I deployed Sec. Prec. and imediately probed Tatooine with the Executor preventing my opponet from Controling Tatooine I dropped Tat Occupation and it became a drain war. I Lateral damaged an X wing at Coruscant deployed ZiMH for there was only 4 ability there and he barriered me. and next turn deployed more xwings to cause atrition. I probed with Zuckass but could not find his hidden Base before the end of the Game. He retrieved using the card that targets number of nonunique starships and I retrieved using Hidden Weapons and Quick reflexes to minimize damages. It was close but i was able to outlast him. <br/>
<br/>
W +5 <br/>
<br/>
The Good: <br/>
     Security Precautions  suprised the @#$%ens out of him.        Hidden weapons Retieval<br/>
<br/>
The Bad:<br/>
<br/>
     I had MMighty Jabba OUt but I didn’t move him to a site where I could utilize Hutt Influence until late in the game<br/>
     I forgot to probe two times<br/>
<br/>
The Ugly:<br/>
<br/>
     Throwing away Secret Plans He retrieved nine force that time and almost cost me the game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Brian Kennedy HDADTJ w/ high destiny <br/>
<br/>
    I have played Brian several times at Mazz so I knew the deck he was playing and I knew I needed a 7 on test five to win before going into the game. I got Both Yoda and DoS in my opening hand and no way to put them back. I activated force searched for and found both Yoda Stews and Traffic Control in my reserve deck. I thought I was missing a signal so I drew up to find I miss counted it took me 3 of 4 turns Traffic Control and to get DoS back in my reseve and not thinking I left Yoda in my Hand. Meanwhile he is drawing like mad looking for his reactor Terminal and not causiing and damage to Visage I didn’t want to lose the force so I didn;’t make him. He also did not Deploy Vader until late in the game. This confused me I thought he would want him down so that I could lose force and him not. After I finaly completed test three I started making us lose force to visage and then canceled Visage using TT. I tried to track a 7 for test five and failed I got a three. I am not good at tracking yet. He deployed another Visage  and Vader. I deployed luke to Vaders site because I was behind. Flipped HD and he Epic Deuled me I drew from reserve and reduced his destiny and lost and crossed Luke over to the DS Game over.<br/>
<br/>
L -14  <br/>
<br/>
The Good: <br/>
<br/>
     I didn’t do much this game <br/>
<br/>
The Bad:                                                                                    Not moving Yoda to his hut.<br/>
      Not Going to space with squadron assignments and draining<br/>
     Should have made him lose to Visage earlier<br/>
<br/>
The Ugly:<br/>
<br/>
     Drawing Yoda and Dos in Starting Hand<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Scott Ligrell Eric Olsens manipulation CCT<br/>
<br/>
     This game went bad from the start. I never saw this deck before but I knew I was in trouble when Miren Onith hit the table turn 1. I deploy DoS and the backpack turn 1 beacause I want to fight with Luke and     lose Yoda to a Force Drain on Scotts second turn. I tried to recover I deployed Farmboy Luke and started to train him. I passed test one I never passed test two. I lost my ships which killed my Sqadron attempt to deploy my males from reserve. He scanned and drained me. and beat me in battle. <br/>
<br/>
      L -34<br/>
<br/>
The Good: <br/>
<br/>
     The attempted recovery with Luke kept me improvising but it might have been better trying to scrap Training and just beatdown since two of my Training adders were gone. <br/>
<br/>
The Bad:<br/>
<br/>
     I should have lost from my hand more. <br/>
<br/>
The Ugly:<br/>
<br/>
 Search and Destroy, and Ability Ability Ability Honor would have helped here but I didn’t include it expecting that effects that caused damage decks would automaticly have No Escape.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Pat Ziagos Cheese MWYHL<br/>
<br/>
     I know Pat I have played several fun games with him and I know not to expect the norm with him. So when I say him Start MWYHL I started No Escape instead if secret plans thinking I could retrieve my lost interupt. Only it was ruled that is illegal. It wasn’t a normal MWYHL there was no Jedi Testing just Beatdown. He used MWYHL to take away SAC and put Yoda at the Hut early. I deployed to Tatooine had a few drains set up and I placed Mandalorian Armor on The Emperor so I could keep him somewhat alone and kill with Hidden Weapons. I also had Janus there. Pat plays Lost in the Wilderness and it is goodbye to the Emperor. I thought I hade space so I deployed ZiMH and didn’t fortify it and played down Tat Occ. Pat plays the Superfalcon and it is goodbye Zuckass. I drain he drains more. and beats me in battles. He out of Comisions me  several times he gets one of My hidden weapons so I can’t retrieve well. <br/>
<br/>
L -22<br/>
<br/>
The Good: <br/>
     I didn’t dp much good but I had many mistakes to learn from.<br/>
     We didn’t time out. PAt and I play slow and our games take a while.<br/>
<br/>
The Bad:<br/>
     I didn’t search for the emperor fast enough even though my destiny is poor in this deck I could’ve gotten lucky.<br/>
     When I did find the Emperor I had already drained and missed on a +1 FD<br/>
     Leaving ZiMH alone for beatdown<br/>
     No Escape<br/>
<br/>
The Ugly:<br/>
     Leaving ZiMH unprotected. <br/>
<br/>
Game 5 Bye<br/>
<br/>
     At this point my confidence is shaken and I am playing Poorly I play a fun game with TD Rich Hamon and he kicks my But. BHBM vs MWYHL and I forget to Move to attempt JT 2 for severl turns. He gets to Dagobah because of it. I know this has been a very bad day for me. After the game I realize I have been playing too defensovely for the deck and I will need to reconcider how I play or build it. This all leads to <br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Vs Steves Court. <br/>
<br/>
     I got another chance with MWYHL. It is late and I still make alot of mental errors but that is OK. We are in the Payton Manning Sweepstakes at this point Loser getts the better cards for prize support. I still want to win though. So does Steve. He already is saying he is going to lose. I don’t like that. I say he doesn’t know that I’ve been playing poorly as well. He gets out Galid, Mosep and Boba Fett Early. He puts the Prophetess on the Dungeon and is draining me for 3 from the reserve on Turn 2 Once again I draw DoS into my hand. This time I am careful in counting and though I don’t like the force loss form reserve I take my time put down traffic control and test through one eliminating his bonus’. He deploys a few more characters to the AC I had vowed to be more agressive this game So I deployed EPP Obi and ECC Chewie and scramble. and Beatdown at the AC. I target and hit he gets no destiny  He had no force so I wasn’t concerned about trap door.  He moves the Prophetess he battles draws a zero for BD he gets hit. We play tag and move away and we drain for a while I fininsh my tests. and then deploy test 6 and deploy Leia to a Battle Ground for 2 extra force loss a turn (he lost Vader earlier in the game.)  I finish my tests. I knew a 7 was coming up for destiny and I kept losing force from my force pile to preserve it and I got lucky and drew it for test 5 though the consequecnce was that he had Secret Plans and I didn’t have the force to retrieve. Things are Going bad for him so he decides he will die in one final swoop He initiates battle I shoot and slice and when everything is done he has 1 force left. I initiate battle to end the game. <br/>
<br/>
The Good: <br/>
     It wasn’t scientific Destiny tracking but it worked.<br/>
     I was agressive <br/>
<br/>
The Bad:<br/>
      I concentrated on battle so much I forgot to move yoda to hut and other training errors.<br/>
      I think I might’ve played to cut throat towards the end of the game. I maybe shoul’ ve been easier on the final battle. <br/>
<br/>
The Ugly: Not concetrating and making the training errors.as this concludes the night and I made such errors all night.<br/>
<br/>
Rich gives out the prizes. Joe G won and got a Yoda T-Shirt and shotgun. Since I was playing with an oversized MWYHL he gave me the oversized HD I also got a pack of reflections. Others got Hoth Boxed game the uniqe rebel speeders and walker garrisons added to thier collections. I got A Leia Organa Foil in my reflections pack and I was quite happy. We went to Perkins. I called my wife  we ate   I ordered her a tremendous tweleve which she did not finish when she finaly got there an hour later. Before my wife arrived I got a Cherry Coke it comes with Oodles of cherries in it (yum) Brian asked about why the cherries I said It is the only cherry I will ever get now. It floored him for I am pretty straight laces and have rarely been perverse in thoughts. So cherry inuendos contined until my wife arrived. Joe wasn’t paying attention and was in the dark. Me and my wife traveled home at 2:00 AM in the morning and fought to stay awake. We arived home at 3:00 and went to bed I fell asleep when I hit the pillow. I might not have played well that day but I had fun and am not discouraged. I will be adding Battle Plan and Kessel for DS didn’t play space locations. DS it’s about as good as it gets Pat talked with me about concidering Meta when building my decks which I seem to wrongly assume. SO Most likely next tournament I will have a different DS deck and one that should match up a bit better against Hidden Base and EBO and the current best decks on this site. Weather Permitting I will be playing at Clark’s Summit in January and hopefuly a better record. <br/>
