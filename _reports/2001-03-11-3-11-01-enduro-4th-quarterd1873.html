<br/>
During the break:<br/>
I was pretty tired at this point, but still awake.  My eyes hurt a little (wearing glasses doesn’t help them at all when pulling all-nighters).  I ate some cookies I had brought and finished my 2-liter of Coca-Cola.  I wanted to work my CPI a tad since part of the deck I found to be useless, but no one had any commons or uncommons on them, so I stuck with it as is.  At 3:15am, after all the Sealed games were done, the final Quarter of the Enduro began.<br/>
<br/>
The Tournament:<br/>
<br/>
My decks:<br/>
LS - All For Her - mains with insanely high destiny draws<br/>
DS - CPI Navy v3.0 - blow away every system on table, and lockdown the win with Ability, Ability, Ability<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS v. Paul Feldman’s SYCFA<br/>
I hate that tournament software.  For those of you not reading all my Enduro TRs in a row, we had played THIS EXACT SAME MATCH LAST GAME.  I drew a lot hoping for a miracle, and he used a Monnok Lost on me, killing all my retrieval (2 D* Plans and 2 On The Edges).  I was done for, and couldn’t do much to reciprocate his large drains.<br/>
Result: FL -30<br/>
Standing: 0(-30)<br/>
Good Things: None.<br/>
Bad Things: THE SAME F**KING GAME AS BEFORE.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: Repost of the compliment from our last game: Feldman’s a great guy, and fun to play (even though I lose), and his retirement will bring down the fun level at these large tournaments Alderaan always has running in it.  Good luck to you, sir!<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS v. Glen Alexander’s MWYHL<br/>
Great; him again.  And two slow decks vs. each other to boot.  I constantly manipulated his hand with Monnok and Defensive Fire &amp; Hutt Smooch, and had M’iiyoom working overtime.  I set up for ADLR, but had slipped on the M’iiyoom for the turn.  What’s he got to deploy?  OBI-WAN.  TK-422 came aboard the Death Star, followed by Daughter Of Skywalker armed with Jedi Test 6.  I fried Dagobah, and let him complete Test 6 to avoid constantly losing 2 to it.  Time was called, and we both, during our respective turns, dumped our hands w/ Reactor Terminal/Traffic Control.  I had 30, and edged him out by 5.<br/>
Result: TW +30<br/>
Standing: 1(0)<br/>
Good Things: Winning.<br/>
Bad Things: Missing that one M’iiyoom.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: See my Enduro 2nd Quarter TR concerning him.  He played EXTREMELY slow, too.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS v. Austin Beck’s EBO Echo Base Troopers<br/>
I saw EBO and smiled.  It was going to be glorious.  Strategic Reserves first turn.  He sets up EBO, gets out a total of seven Hoth sites, along with Kiffex.  On my way to Hoth, I blow away Kiffex, and Kessel comes out on his turn.  Three turns later, with a tracked 6, Hoth exploded, causing him 18 Force loss and giving him ADLR.  I moved over to Kessel, blew that away, and secured the AAA lockdown.<br/>
Result: FW +26<br/>
Standing: 3(+26)<br/>
Good Things: "We will crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke."  And I did.<br/>
Bad Things: Wasting a scrub.<br/>
Compliment of opponent: It looked to be a Hoth drain deck, using all the marker sites and Echo Troops backed w/ Rebel Ambushes.  If not for CPI and CHYBC!, may have worked.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS v. Tanner Hicks’ BHBM<br/>
He started off by saying, "Well, what’s gonna beat me now?" so I figured he was tired and depressed with his Enduro run.  I flipped fast.  He piled a ton of mains on the Death Star II DB, and moved them all over to Yavin 4 chasing Prisoner 2187.  I dropped Chewbacca, Protector with Leia, and ran away.  EPP Han and Threepio joined them the following turn at the Death Star DB327.  He battled all them; I Fallen Portal-ed EJP Dengar.  Tarkin was shot, and I drew a 5, 4, 1 to his 6.  I lost Threepio and 8D8; he placed all but Lord Vader (who was escorting EPP Luke) out of play.  Corran Horn was at the Coruscant DB doing nothing; Prince Xizor came after him but got Fallen Portal-ed and placed out of play.  He runs Vader to the Death Star II.  I save Force in order to follow.  He drops Palpy, moves Vader over, and starts dueling; I win every single duel.  To end it, I moved all my mains (EPP Obi joined the crew) to the Throne Room for a royal battle.  Guess what he does: draws up.<br/>
Result: FW +34<br/>
Standing: 5(+60)<br/>
Good Things: Winning.<br/>
Bad Things: Playing a disheartened player. <br/>
Compliment of opponent: Can’t really compliment him as he didn’t treat it as a serious game.<br/>
<br/>
Results:<br/>
Out of 40 total entrants, 32 stayed for all four Enduro Quarters.  Paul Feldman went undefeated through all of them and claimed the title of Enduro Champ.  Kevin Shannon came in second, with Mike Mendoza behind him in third.  I placed 13th, which I felt to be pretty good since I had a fun LS deck and a vicious DS deck.  Prizes sucked, since we had to rent the space to play all night (at least I hope that this is the reason why).  I got a $5 gift certificate to A-1 Comics, the hosts, and 1 pack of Death Star II, which was the standard.  I pulled General Calrissian, and used the $5 to buy some binder sleeves for my collection.<br/>
After chilling for a few minutes, we hit the road, stopped in Lodi for breakfast, and proceeded home, arriving 2 ½ hours later.<br/>
