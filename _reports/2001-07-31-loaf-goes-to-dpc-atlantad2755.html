<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok, this is my semi-decent TR for the DPC, since I actually remember what happened in my games, unlike at the warmup TR where i just kinda made it up :-)<br/>
<br/>
ok, not much pre tourney junk, cept i flew down from philly on thursday, chilled with my uncle. if you really care, there is more about what i did in my warm up TR, but this is already gonna be a long tr cause i played all 8 games. ILL NEVER DROP OUT AT A TOURNEY!<br/>
<br/>
Decks:<br/>
LS- WYS Podracing. its sick. but i suck so it sucks too<br/>
DS- Basically the same non-epic dueling huntdown that i played at the warm up, cept i put in some of the sniper combo. that card proved to be useful to no end. its so sweet!<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS vs Cliff Fontenot’s Endor Ops (1530s)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I had just met Cliff before the tourney, cause we were sitting around, so we talked a little, then we got paired. sweet. or maybe we just met when we got paired.. i have no clue. but anyway, he started endor ops, and i played my racing wys. i started the race early, he had no racer, but it took me forever to win, so i had a ton of cards on my racer. i basically owned on tatooine and in space, as he lost alot of star destroyers (and rumors) off the top of his deck to early kessel drains. at one point it was my drain of 5 or so to his of 0. he basically never got set up. i never saw a ship/character stay on table for more than a turn for him. and to make matters worse, i had 11 cards active, 1 in deck (which i knew was a losing track), and he had one, and i had just won the race. so i played an on the edge for 5, then he lost 6, and i retrieved 6, and i put my race destinies back, and i won by some ungodly amount for my first game in a DPC<br/>
<br/>
FW +33<br/>
2(+33)<br/>
<br/>
highs: winning a game, by alot too!<br/>
lows: having to own someone as cool as Cliff<br/>
ugly: having a ton of race destinies going back into my deck to pump up the diff<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
inbetween games, after celebrating and braggin a little bit, it kinda hit me hard. "damn, you just won by 33, that means you’ll probably have to play someone who actually plays well all the time!"<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS vs Andy McClure’s WYS Raiders (2000s)<br/>
<br/>
uh oh, now i was screwed. Ive heard of Andy on decktech, and remembered that he was a jerk to me on here, but i put that aside, cause he seemed cool in person. we start playing, and he says he is going to lose, but i told him nah, im a newbie, and hes safe. he still says that he is going to lose, but whatever. he gets down some raiders early, and i just cant safely dispatch them, so i eat up drains of 1 until he can get down ill take the leader, then i take drains of 2, since i dont wanna go to space with my limited crew to play any of my 13 or so admirals orders, so i just cycle them back in with reactor terminal. i basically dont do a damn thing all game, and i think i duel luke, but its for some insignifcant amount, like a 6 force swing or something. he gets big drains going, and i just cant handle them, so i draw up before he can retrieve anymore<br/>
<br/>
FL -28<br/>
2(+5)<br/>
<br/>
highs: I was still in the positives!<br/>
lows: palace raiders suck<br/>
<br/>
Andy proved to be quite cool in person, i totally forgive whatever he did on here to give me the impression that he sucked. he even apologized for playing wys after we played. he was very cool, when i didnt expect it.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS vs Sander Hartlage’s TDIGWATT Merc Pilots (1695)<br/>
<br/>
well, i thought i could handle this, but i made some stupid mistakes. i forgot to drain twice or so, and also forgot to draw race destiny. i also couldnt drop melas on the outrider because the passenger slot and the pilot slot was full of ralltiir freighter cappys and dash, and maul in space decided to come wreck me. but he couldnt, because he couldnt even battle, but that was even better for him, so i couldnt hold menace fades for very long, as i was running between kessel and tatooine. i held him off for a while, but it was that maul in space, and the forgetting to draw race destiny that screwed me over. it would have been much closer if i remembered to draw race destiny<br/>
<br/>
FL -10<br/>
2(-10)<br/>
<br/>
highs: not much<br/>
lows: maul in space, damn 1 passenger space on outrider, forgetting destiny, dark deal, etc etc<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS vs Rick Stepp’s Slave Mains (1500 or so)<br/>
<br/>
damn, rick has gotta be the biggest guy ive ever seen play this game. and not obese big, but buff big. he had the beer belly, but you could tell he was strong as hell. he was also cool as sh!t, and was one of the best games i played all day.<br/>
<br/>
it started off with my getting a vader in hand, and getting out a dbay, we each lost 1 to visage, then he went. he got down shmi and naked 3po to the slave quarters, and started doing 3pos thing everyturn. my second turn i brought down vader and saber to the d* dbay, flipped, and drained for 2 for a while, until i found mara. all the while he was losing to visage, and eventually he played an OOC/TT on it. but down came mara and stick, chopped shmi, 3po went down to attrition, mara stayed cause they dont get destiny. then epp han and some guys came to mess up mara, and did so successfully, but she was immune to the low destiny he drew, and he lost one guy, cause mara missed chopping (how?!) next turn, maul and palpy came down, smacked the survivors around for some overflow, and they sat there to drain for 4 for the rest of the game, while vader and tarkin drained for 2 at the d* dbay. zuckuss and 4lom went to rendili, and drained for 1, but he lost the falcon off the top, and i think another ship too, but he never challenged me in space, and i basically out drained him, but i did lose a bunch to visage and a few random drains, plus over deployment<br/>
<br/>
FW +30<br/>
4(+20)<br/>
<br/>
highs: playing a solid game. meeting rick, just having a fun game. how does a deck that doesnt retrieve win by 30?<br/>
lows: mara getting hurt<br/>
ugly: sniper combo, that card hurt him badly this game, the dark strike part is the best!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: DS vs Drew Lichtenstein’s WYS (1700s)<br/>
<br/>
I automatically assumed that drew was poor player because he was young, but this kid has some skill. he had a sick WYS deck with 5, yes FIVE control/tunnel visions. that was sick, i rarely got any decent drains off. but i had big beats, and i think luke got dueled, but it wasnt for very much. after his controls ran out, the drains took a big toll, and i basically controlled tatooine with maul/mara/empy/vader  with maul and empy in the cantina and vader/mara/tarkin at the dbay, i was draining for 6, plus 1 at rendili with zuckuss and crew, who cycled some good destiny. he did manage to hurt me a little (in space i believe) and get some decent drains, plus i was forced to draw up a bunch to find the cards i needed.<br/>
<br/>
FW +17<br/>
6 (+47)<br/>
ugly: FIVE CONTROLS! jeez.<br/>
<br/>
well, im almost tempted to stop writing now because its all down hill for here.. but oh well<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: LS vs Clay Ramey’s Endor Ops DSII (1900s)<br/>
<br/>
well, we started our game, then there were some pairing mess ups, and we stopped playing because we thought i had to move up, then i didnt have to move up, and it kinda sucked, cause we lost 2 turns of a game. ack. well, he got a first turn operational DSII, so i dont think it was shuffled up very well, but oh well. he basically owned me in space with thrawn and guri, so WYS was about useless. not much to say, he just out drained me and made me lose 3 a turn. kinda sucked, and i dont remember any small details<br/>
<br/>
FL -11<br/>
6(+36)<br/>
<br/>
ok, by this time, ive been drinking a bottle of water each game, and takin a piss between games. i had to draw up during the last game cause i had to piss so badly. i was so damn nervous that i was dehydrated. i suck!<br/>
<br/>
Game 7: DS vs Clay Willoum (sp?)’s WYS<br/>
<br/>
whats up with people named Clay? ive never seen anyone named clay up north, and here are 2 in 2 games. wierd.<br/>
<br/>
well, i started out well, but he came back, and started to own me. i thought i had him, but he played RLR from the lost pile to stop the duel, then put luke on a patrol craft. with that went any chance of winning. he just drained me out from there, but i dont really remember any details, sorry, long weekend<br/>
<br/>
FL -18<br/>
6(+18)<br/>
<br/>
ack, im starting to suck, too long of a weekend. <br/>
<br/>
Game 8: LS vs Chris McClure’s HD (1690)<br/>
<br/>
ok, i had a bad hand, that had 3 jedi lukes, and some other useless junk. i had no TT, so i lost to visage the whole game, and he schooled my luke twice, and i lost one to a drain. he just outplayed me, and his deck just wrecked WYS. i cant say much, cause i didnt do much, i just got absoluetly schooled. DAMN LORD VADER!!!!<br/>
<br/>
FL -18<br/>
6(+0)<br/>
<br/>
well, i ended up with even diff, but on my card it said -5, so i dunno, i copied this exactly off the command card, so they mustve screwed up, or i did, but i dont mind. i wanted to go 4-4, but nope, i went a disappointing 3-5, but eh, i didnt make any major mistakes, so i was happy with the outcome.<br/>
