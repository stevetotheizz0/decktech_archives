<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Disclaimer: I wrote a nice long report originally and it got messed up so here is the bad version. I am not going to spend 30 minutes rewriting stuff I already did...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I had a nice long TR ready and I typed it in Internet Explorer and right when I was up to the standings at the end some @#$% IM’ed me and I hit back by accident (I have an optical mouse). This deleted all my progress and now I AM PISSED! Be prepared for a sucky report....<br/>
<br/>
Ok, Brad has a charity tournament ready, only 14 people come because Mastic guys didn’t come. Oh well, Dan Sotelo and Derek Halpern are there and they haven’t played in like a year...<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My Ties VS. Jesse Sibler’s Old Mains deck<br/>
He’s from Albany and hasn’t played since Special Edition. He has no space and I spread and drain and block his draisn with spies and such and he loses because he can’t do anything about my drain of 6. I win by 21.<br/>
FW 2(+21)<br/>
<br/>
Blah blah blah I had more stuff here before but damn people suck!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My WYS Vs. Dan Sotelo’s (1832) Black Sun<br/>
He gets out Guri with Xizor and Presence if the Force at the starting site to flip. I kill Zuckuss in space and Emperor and a Vigo go to my Cantina. I can’t do anything else and I die. I lose by 14.<br/>
FL 2(+7)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My WYS Vs Wayne Cullen’s (1480 something) Maul deck<br/>
I kill Mara early and go to Kessel to drain. He then takes control of the ground and drained me for 4 a turn. I play On The Edge a few times and kill him off as he runs low on force. I win by 19.<br/>
FW 4(+26)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My Ties Vs. Matt Ehrhart’s (1952) Podprofit<br/>
He has seen my deck already. He starts Battle Plan. I kill Artoo in ship early and he wins the race and spreads on the ground. He retrieves alot with On the Edge. I can’t pay to drain for long and I lose by 13.<br/>
FL 4(+13)<br/>
<br/>
Prizes were good. Dan won and Matt got 2nd but both were 4 and 0. I got 7th out of 14.<br/>
<br/>

The person who IM’ed me about school and who messed up my original TR<br/>

Optical mouse: Damn back button!<br/>
