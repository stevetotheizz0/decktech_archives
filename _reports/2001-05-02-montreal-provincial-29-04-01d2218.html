<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I guess it all started this week when we started to get down and start making our decks for the provincial. i playtested a lot of decks 2 or 3 kind of watch your step, set your course, bring him to me, dagobah, hidden base. After talking some tech with yannick i decided to go with him on the light side Mind what you have learned, and dark i decided to use a deck that i like a lot my bring him battle(no duel).<br/>
<br/>
Sunday Provincial<br/>
<br/>
We got a good turnout with 50 people nice out of all of them there’s only 8 i hope not to hit until 4 round.<br/>
<br/>
Round1 <br/>
game1<br/>
My light vs Guillaume Soucy Dark Cloud City<br/>
Darn first game and i hit one the 8 i didn’t want to play against. Well we get started not much happens in the 5-6 turn i activate do my test to 5 he does a couple of cc sabacc as soon as test5 is done test6 comes and since there’s no vader on table he starts losing to test6 jedi knight, obi-wan epp, han epp, orrimarko and corran horn are already on cloud city giving a hell of time. Finish him but not before i retrive 10 with 2 on the edge.<br/>
2(+21)<br/>

Highs- Well the deck went well<br/>
lows- having to play a friend<br/>
<br/>
Round1<br/>
game2<br/>
my dark vs Dominic Gaudrealt<br/>
F_uck not him not now well theres goes the plan of playing them only in the last round i’m 2 in 2 for playing my friend I see his start and already know i am gonna lose i try my best but his watch your step just runs over me like freight train at one point i have vader and his lightsaber + mara and i still get beat down with his palace raiders. full loss by 27<br/>
2(-6)<br/>
<br/>
Round2<br/>
game3<br/>
my light vs sorry could not remember is name. Bhtm tie bomber<br/>
One of the weirdest game i played he started with the effect that gives +5 to bomber destiny and notice he play the bomber with 2 destiny witch gave them in battle a 7. i was expecting a fast game on his part but he only manage to deploy walkelmui, sullust and ds2 docking bay in the 4 first turn, on my side i had test6 going and vader was out of controlled when he came chasing down on dahgobah to make him lose a total of 4 per turn and he still hasn&amp;#8217;t deployed a battleground. He finally comes down to duel leia for test6 vader and leia duel draw 2 5’s he draws low test6 complete draw one more destiny everywhere. game win by +11<br/>
4 (+5)<br/>
<br/>
highs good game for me since i thinks i should have lost only got home one in the deck<br/>
lows none<br/>
Round2 <br/>
game4<br/>
my dark vs marc gagnon thgih ewok <br/>
Marc is a very nice guy but i was not the pairing he could have its was all finish in the 3 turn when he  moves against vader with his lightsaber emperor to stop search and destroy  my turn deploy snoova colonel davod jon battle capture with snoova  you’re beaten he is left with 2 ewok slash one he plays a interrup to draw a destiny i draw a 4 he draws a 0 lots of battle damage. game win +33<br/>
6(+38)<br/>
<br/>
game5<br/>
my light vs jessie dimaurizio hdadtj duel<br/>
ok no prob honor hits the table fast he doesn’t play no escape, he only as 2 battle location test1-6, uncontrolle fury, anger fear aggression, all of them combine with about 15 force retrival gave me another win by +27 not much else can be said i knew he play a lot of visage so didn&amp;#8217;t bother to cancel it and went to the holotable. <br/>
8(+65)<br/>
<br/>
with this win it give me a chance at the top2 and at the same time the final only need a good pairing...<br/>
<br/>
round3<br/>
game6<br/>
my dark vs martin perreault <br/>
darn i know his watch your step i know that my chance to win are very low. i look around i notice that the guys sitting next to me is playin massasi base operation, if only i could’ve played him... Anyway i play martin the best i could but in a battle in witch i out power him by one i have vader with lightsaber and mara jade lightsaber he as artoo and threepio, protector and patrol craft with palace raider he plays i have a very bad felling double battle damage plays artoo ihave a bad feeling no destiny he draws a 6,5,5 humm 30 battle damage forfeit vader and mara and still lose 15 force. Well from there on i did my best. Full lost 10<br/>
8(55)<br/>
<br/>
well i finish 9th overall Dominic and Raphael go in the final Dominic wins the first game by 8 and Ralph wins the others won bye 20 something, so Ralph is again the champion of Quebec last time that happen he won the Worlds guess we never know.<br/>
