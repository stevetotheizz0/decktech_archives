<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The tourney was held at The Comic Alternative and run by Dan Bojanowski. 25 People showed up...the largest crowd in quite awhile! I was playing Profit and Eloms for LS and Rallops for DS. My rating before the tourney: 1619.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS vs Brian Casimiro(1820)playing COTVG w/space<br/>
<br/>
Brian had been out to my place the night before so we could test some decks before todays tourney and I have played against his Court deck a number of times so I knew how it worked. I started normal Profit stuff along with Insurrection, Staging area and Wise Advice. He started No bargain, numbers killer and something else and put Jabba and Chall at the AC. His first turn he fortifies the AC with Outer Rim Scouts, Myo and ECC 4Lom....looks like I’m not going there right away as my Eloms are crap against Court decks. I put down some docking bays first turn and draw. He gets out Endor with zuckuss in ship and another couple aliens to AC and Tatooine: Jabbas Palace. My turn I drop Bargaining Table, Jedi Luke to the Home One DB and Ben to Tatooine docking bay, both with sticks and Luke with proficiency...I move Luke for free to Taooine DB.I cancel his drain for 2 at Endor with an Elom and he drops another system with Fett in ship there. I’m slowly making my way over to the AC with Ben, Luke Lando and Eloms while he’s draing for a couple a turn. He drops Scum the turn after I move my squad in the AC and he initiates...super Luke and Ben are too much for his scum crew and I clear most the site and he moves the rest away. I free Han retrieving 5 force and thats when my Profit kicks in. Tessek and a monk to the AC, I leave Ben and Han there and move Luke, Lando and eloms out to play. Chewie comes down and I’m draining for around 7 plus Profit damage a turn while he hits me in space for 5 but I’m canceling 2 of that with Bargaining table. He drops a couple of alien scrubs down but can’t handle Super Luke. I drain him out with a win by 13.<br/>
<br/>
2(+13)<br/>
Highs: Clearing out Jabba and the gang at the AC <br/>
Lows: Taking so long to free Han<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS vs Michael Shipps(1832) QMC w/inserts<br/>
<br/>
I saw QMC hit the table and wasn’t sure what to expect but MIke was at the tourney the week before and I knew he was playing inserts there so I started the numbers killer, IAO and Mob. Points. I had Palpy in my opening Hand so I pull a site and some docking bays and draw. He drops some sites Lando in Falcon to Bespin CC and Leesub to Home One docking bay. Leesub? Ok I’m not throwing my numbers effect thats for sure. I drop Fett in ship to bespin and another site to Ralltir with Palpy, draw a couple and leave a couple behind. He drops some more destiny 4 aliens to CC DB and moves Leesub there and Moves Lando in Falcon to Bespin with an Elom on board. <br/>
I drop one of the star destroyers from D*2 with Piett and Ig88 in ship to bespin, a couple of scrubs to Ralltir, flip and battle at Bespin....he reacts with Spiral but my power is too high cause I get 2 battle destiny plus 3 from my objective...I clear the site. <br/>
His turn he drops a couple of cloud cars and an elom to my ralltir site where I have a couple of scrubs and clears me out. I drop Lord Vader and ECC 4Lom, battle, cancel the Eloms game text and clear him out. Next turn he drops Jedi Luke with stick to Palpys site, battles misses on the swing and I draw a 6(9 with Rallops) for destiny to his 2 and bye bye Jedi Luke. He’s getting mad at this point and activates his 16 force on his turn and draws it all without even looking at it and then lets me drain him out on my turn saying he quits. Whatever. Win by 24.<br/>
<br/>
4(+37)<br/>
Highs: Beating down Mike<br/>
Lows: Mike getting so mad. it’s just a game mike :-)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS vs Chris Burnett(1400) Kessel start w/combat respose<br/>
<br/>
Chris was telling me earlier how he had been doing real well this tourney so I had no idea what to expect with this deck of his.<br/>
I started normal Profit start and freed Han real quick while he was dropping systems and Star Destroyers and ties all over the place. ack. He’s draining me for 5 a turn in space and I’m trying to find Bargaining Table like crazy. I finally do to slow his drains but then he makes a mistake that turns the game for me. He drops CC Fett By himself at the Cantina and here I am with super Luke in hand(Jedi Luke, his stick and Proficiency). Can you say Beatdown?<br/>
I drop Luke and Chewbacca at the Cantina and get rid of Fett...I thought maybe a ghkk was coming but nope...I did miss on hitting him though so he loses Fett and 11 more. I do the Kessek, Monk, Elom shuffle and drain him out. Win by 19.<br/>
<br/>
6(+56)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: None really...<br/>
Lows: Couldn’t find my drain canceller<br/>
<br/>
OK at this point there is 4 people undefeated but 3 of us played LS and I had the lowest Diff of all of us so I wasn’t playing someone who was undefeated(does that make sense?) Anyways I end up playing Chris again, swapping sides. I felt kinda bad about this because between the game he came outside while I was smoking to show me his LS deck he had one with...so here I am looking throught it and then we play against each other. ugh. Sorry Chris. Of course neither of us thought we would play again. Anyways:<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My DS vs Chris Burnett(1400) Ewok deck<br/>
This was a quick game...I flipped quick while he dropped sites and ewoks to Endor. I was trying to get a high diff so I could maybe win my first tourney but he dropped ithorians out and I had to go battle him on Endor. I hack and choke some eloms and keep altering his Bargainin Table, then he drops Jedi Luke and stick with Solo and Daughter with a stick and makes me run... but I get overseeing it on palpy on Ralltir and hit him for too much drains. win by 25<br/>
8(+81)<br/>
Highs: Its fun choking and slashing furballs<br/>
Lows: Making me run from Super Luke and crew.<br/>
<br/>
Well I just miss out on winning by 6 diff. It was my first tourney undefeated though and I was pretty happy with my playing against some fairly high rated players.<br/>
<br/>
Top 3 Standings:<br/>
1.Steven Yeager 8(+87)<br/>
2.Me 8(+81)<br/>
3.Paul Evans 8(+79)<br/>
<br/>
I got a foil blizzard 2 for 2nd and pulled a Flagship Executor in my packs. Not bad.<br/>
