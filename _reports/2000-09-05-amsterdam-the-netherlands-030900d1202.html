<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Trep Amsterdam 030900<br/>
<br/>
This was the first tournament after the Ryloth Regional and the European Continentals, so there was nothing at stake which resulted in a very laid-back tournament. <br/>
It was kind of a crossover tournament between the "regular" players and the European Youth League, a group of young players who play regularly against eachother but do not have a lot of cards. There were 18 players, which is a pretty good turnout for our region, but unfortunately the European StarTrek champion Bjorn Neervoort couldn't make it due to the stupid railroad company in the Netherlands. But this also meant no bye's, so that's ok.<br/>
For my decks, I chose my Bring Him Before Me deck, which went 3-0 at the regional. It features the Emperor, with Resistance and Point man besides him. For light I made this "fun" Hidden base with matching pilots deck, featuring Wedge Antilles and co-starring Logistical Delay and Kin Kian aka King Kong.<br/>
<br/>
The Games:<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS vs EYL-player, sorry forgot his name.<br/>
<br/>
He played a deck with all kinds of cards he liked, but they weren't really working together. He didn't know the rules very good and there was nothing I could do to not beat him up. In the end it was a 23 point victory for me.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS vs Marc's profit<br/>
<br/>
Marc is a pretty good player, until recently he only played fun decks, but at the Continentals he surprised almost everybody by making it into day 2.<br/>
I start with Mara in the chamber, drop the emperor at the throne room with his Power and gave Mara her stick and awaited the beatdown. Masta Luke came down, together with ECC Chewie. He battled, misbounced Mara with a Ben for destiny, didn't shoot her with chewie, with a Ben for Destiny. I failed to saber chewie, drew a 0 and a 1. His destiny was 2, mine 8 (I've got the power..) He loses everything, I nothing. Next turn I drop lord vader, moved mara outside to drain, with an Imperial Barrier and sense for backup (lost in the wilderness). By the time he drew enough characters for the beatdown, he already lost too much force. A 20-pointer for me.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS vs Pieter 'lekkere vent' Heerma<br/>
<br/>
Pieter is one of the 'Reservoir Dogs', a crew from Amsterdam who always play against eachother for playtesting, and in tournaments because they always get paired up against eachother. He played Bring Him Befor Me, as did the majority of the players.<br/>
In the beginning he went pretty fast, with vader and saber at a docking bay, tarkin and Jabba at another, search and destroy out and the Emperor Powering up his throne room. But when I flipped, the drain for 3 at coruscant and the drain of 4 at Kessel really hurt him. He went for the probe, but chose to probe at endor (parsec 8) and Kessel (8), but my hidden base was at parsec 4. His ships couldn't reach it and he got drained to death. A full win with 17.<br/>
<br/>
After game 3, I went with the Dogs to the McDonald's for another nutrious meal, and we got back just in time for game 4. Lousy service.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS vs Koen 'lamme tak' Meijssen<br/>
<br/>
Koen is currently the number 1 ranked player in the Netherlands/Ryloth and he goes in October to Orlando to represent Ryloth for the second time in a row. A tough matchup. He played a dagobah-deck, kinda like Yannick LaPointe used to win the American Continentals. He wasn't very lucky and my deck worked like its supposed to work, so I won the battles, he didn't drew good destiny, he didn't get captain Han and he lost by 8. But it was a very relaxed game and we both had fun.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS vs Koen 'again, again' Meijssen<br/>
<br/>
This time he got his revenge. He played BHBM with manipulation. I tried to get as much characters out as possible before he got total control, but it didn't work. He manipulated my characters away, made sure I didn't drew Kessel and then finished me off with search and destroy and Boba Fett in Slave 1 with fodder on the back seat. I had grappled his 'a dangerous time' but my second grappler went lost so he could alter whatever he wanted. He altered my Projection about 5 times and my order to engage 4 times. Who ever said Sense/Alter was dead??<br/>
He won with 8.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS vs Arjan 'Nice Guy Eddie' vd Broek<br/>
<br/>
As he told me, he played a bad light deck. And it was pretty bad. I didn't get the right cards, and neither was he, so we drew up for about 6 turns and then clashed head to head in a couple of battles, which I won and he couldn't do anything about it.<br/>
Full win with 20.<br/>
<br/>
Koen lost his last game against Marc, so I finished on top of the dogs, and received 8 boosters prize support. Note: this is almost as much as I received when I got second at the continentals. The legendary TD Bas 'Baragwin' Van Zuilen ran another great tournament, and the 1 DSII booster he opened contained an Emperor.<br/>
I got a WB Dianoga, a WB EBO and some other stuff, while I donated 2 boosters to the Jugend League.<br/>
The 2 hour trip back was a nice one, I sat in the train together with a so called 'dweilorkest', sort of a bigband who played a lot of nice songs, a bit too loud.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I will be able to attend the tourney in Helmond next week,<br/>
