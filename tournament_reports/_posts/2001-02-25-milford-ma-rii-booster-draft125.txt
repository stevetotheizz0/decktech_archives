<br>
	It was another Saturday and the tournament this time was in Milford. It was a Reflection 2 booster draft and I had never been in one so I figured what the hell. I show up a few minutes early and find 6 other people there. A few more people show up and we basically have the normal crew. Some of the people entering were Hayes Hunter, Brian Ciezinski, John Shapiro, Kris Earle, Paul Maholick, Mike Pistone, and Jared Greenwald. We get started drafting at about 12:30 .<br>
<br>
	Not remembering to bring 6 battleground locations for each side I had to scrounge my binder for some. The ones I used were solid sites I could drain for two at but I didn&amp;#8217;t have a jabba&amp;#8217;s palace and related locations for dark side. I was very nervous drafting in the beginning because for the first 8 or10 times I got no characters with ability. My space fleet was horrible too. My picks improved a little as we went on. All I know is I was forced to draft too many lift tubes and japanese hoth @#$%. My space fleet consisted of an IG in ship,a tie scout, and a tie advanced. My power (and I use that term losely) cards were 2 evazans+babas, Xizor, tauntan skull, feltipern trevagg, ponda babas gun, reyees, bane malar, and death star war room(SL).I also got strategic reserves and 3 non-unique imps to work with it. I know that I got crap compared to other people especially when I heard John Shapiro bragging that he got LSRS, chewie w/gun, dash, outrider, corran horn, and owen+beru. He also got the Home 1 but he would probably never be able to activate enough to put it down. Guess who I was facing in the first game&amp;#8230;<br>
<br>
Game 1 VS John Shapiro<br>
<br>
	I started DS war room  and he started cantina to my relief. I got the early force jump on him with first turn evazan+baba to the cantina and a hoth defensive perimeter. I drained at the cantina for a little while and put a few more guys there. He was meanwhile taking my drains and saving force . I spread to the defensive perimeter with feltipern trevagg and bane malar. He was just saving up force and he finally put down LSRS at the cantina. He didn&amp;#8217;t even battle me so on my next turn I battled with about 4 powerful  aliens/droids and overpowered him. All I had to lose was my 2 forfiet jawa and he lost luke. So I was draining for 4 now and he was getting very weak. I put down a probe droid at the cantina because it was in japanese and I forgot it can&amp;#8217;t deploy without a star destroyer . Neither of us noticed so this gave me a good view of his small hand for the rest of the game. After seeing he had no space I put down my endor system and a tie scout there with commander praji as a pilot.I recycled the tauntan skull from my hand and drained him out for a huge win.<br>

Game 2 VS Kris Earle<br>
<br>
	I started the same and he started the throne room. He went first but he was activating less than me so I was in good shape. I got down endor with a tie scout and a scrub piloting. I was hoping he would be weak in space so I could get a few quick drains on him . It worked for 2 turns but he the deployed liberty to block. I couldn&amp;#8217;t do much in space so I played hoth defensive perimeter and put feltipern trevagg there on a dewback.I the drew up and got 2 characters and  the powerful tauntaun skull into hand. The next turn he realized you can&amp;#8217;t deploy dewbacks to hoth so he said it was lost. I&amp;#8217;m really not aware of these things because I never look at or play any of these cards. It was very lucky for me because Kris the deployed the card rebel pilot to his liberty and battled. It looked bad for me but tauntan skull came to save the day!!! I placed my dewback out of play for +5 power. I was still overpowered and weak in space so I forfieted them but the tauntan skull saved me some valuable force. I now had a 5 to track also.<br>
 I continued to drain at the hoth defensive perimeter until I was opposed by Leebo, elom, moisture farmer, and a chadra fan. It took me a few turns of battling and few shots with ponda babas gun but I kicked them off my site. Meanwhile I was taking drains of 1 at endor but some of them were getting blocked by stormtroopers and imperial pilots with strategic reserves. He then played momaw nadon and scrub at my war room and a cloud city trooper and kitonak at his newly deployed CC guest quarters. I took care of this with evazan+baba with an imperial blaster to the guest quarters. I had a 3 tracked so I knew I would hit and operate on his trooper and my tauntan skull for battle destiny. I deployed come here you big coward to shut down his drains at the DS war room after his characters would be knocked off the guest quarters.I battled and it worked like a charm. After the CC trooper was operated on it was just my power 6 evazan+baba with a destiny of 5 to his 1 power. He had to lose the kitonak and 7 more. That was basically game and before it was over I set up a mining droid and a timed mine to my DS war room. Kris drew up before it had time to explode and destroy momaw nadon and scrub. <br>
FW by 8 I think<br>
4(+35)<br>
<br>
GAME 3 VS Hayes Hunter<br>
<br>
	He started hutt trade route so I immediately was fearful of sandwhirl. I deployed defensive perimeter early and he got out a tatooine desert and a jabbas palace entrance cavern. I put my ortugg there  because he was power and forfeit +1 there and an abiltiy 2 scrub. I drained there for 1 and then deployed a swoop and 2 scrubs to his trade route.. I moved my crew at the entrance cavern  to his  hut trade route with the help of another swoop. I didn&amp;#8217;t even get to drain because Hayes then put down a wookie, disruptor pistol, and some ability scrubs. My ortugg was shot down  and I was left with two mining droid and praji and a swoop.I lost the swoop and a mining droid and a card from hand. The next turn I deployed bane malar to the hoth defensive perimeter and moved my swoop with the mining droid and praji away to Hayes&amp;#8217; unoccupied tat. desert . I drew up a lot trying to find some good stuff and I forgot to leave a force for bane malar. I then got dumped on by 3 or 4 aliens to malar&amp;#8217;s site and I drew a 1 for destiny. Hayes drew at least a 3. Whatever it was I had to lose malar and 8 or 10 more . This was basically the game because my drains on tat. were being blocked and he was draining me for about 4 a turn. He deployed LSRS and had total control of the board. I then proceeded to get drained out.<br>

<br>
Final Game VS Jared Greenwald<br>
<br>
	He starts bothawui and I start the same. I get out a tie scout and IG in ship for  early drains at the system . He gets a good start by getting a generic site to bothawui and a bothwuain operative. He adds to that site with firn morret , a droid merchant, a t16 skyhopper, and 3 snub fighters for free because of firin&amp;#8217;s text. He waits a turn and then he flies the ships up . I put an ability 2 pilot on the tie scout and battle. I get a 3 for destiny and he draws none. He just loses one of his ships. He is still draining me on the generic site but a lucky womp rat kills off his operative and firin morret after only 2 turns. I also spread to the endor forest clearing with large power. He deploys kashyyyk and flies his snub fighters there to avoid my decent space fleet.He is draining for 2 a turn and I&amp;#8217;m draining for 4 a turn so I eventually just drain him out with 3 cards left in my hand. <br>
FW by 12<br/>
6(+37)<br/>
<br/>
I don&amp;#8217;t really know all the standings but here are the top 3:<br/>
<br/>
1. (LS)Hayes Hunter 8(+?)<br/>
2. (DS)Michael Schiemer 6(+37)<br/>
3. (LS)Kris Earle  6(+37)<br/>
<br/>
Hayes won and Kris Earle and me tied for second. I got to chose my prize first because I was the dominant DS player and he was the 2nd place LS player. I chose a leia w/gun foil. <br/>
<br/>
After the tournament some people hung out and I played some games. I used my LS crap deck and I almost lost to a below decent  TIE interceptor deck. I am scrapping that deck as soon as possible. My undefeated dark side HDADTJ w/admirals deck won by a diff. of 25 against a pretty strong flipping HB deck. I only lost 3 cards the whole game.That deck is a machine. <br/>
<br/>
