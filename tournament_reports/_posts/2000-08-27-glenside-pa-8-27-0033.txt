<br>
Ah, yes, my monthly ritual.  I arrived with caffeine in hand at about 10 minutes to 12 to find 8-10 people already waiting for me!!  Within the next 15 minutes, the store opens and we have 22 people ready to start to play.  There are few other gamers there so SWCCG ruled the house!!!<br>
<br>
So Everyone is registered and we are beginning game 1 at about 12:15.  People are quiet and games go without major rulings or clarifications needed.  At 12:40 Joe Young arrives and asks if he gets the bye (sorry, 0(0) for you, Joe).  This was a good call because 5 minutes later 2 other boys arrive thinking the tourney started at 1pm.  We get them all registered and the first game winds up.  Game 2 starts at about 1:10pm (making up some time!) and continues without major rulings (darn!!  this is easy!!)  The question pops out whether or not Lando with gun is matching pilot for Falcon....  I say yes because the Falcon identifies Lando as the pilot.  Sean McGarity and I play a fun game while we wait for everyone to finish.  The games end and we are almost right on schedule.  After game 2, Chris Praskac, Greg Hodur, Andy Talaga, Livio D'Alessio, Doug Faust, and Pete Flamini are all undefeated, with Chris and Livio the top guns at this point.<br>
<br>
Game 3 begins and everyone is watching Livio and Chris out of the corner of their eyes.  They are great friends and tough competitors, and they are each others "good and bad twin"  After a close game, Chris edges Livio by 10 and Greg and Andy are the only other undefeated players at this point.  In game 4, Chris and Livio end up facing each other again, and Greg and Andy meet.  Chris wallops Livio by 34 and Greg beats Andy by 15.  Gus D'Alessio and John Lolli are also 3-1 at this point, so if Chris loses a game or 2 the tournament is still up for grabs.  After game 4, Newcomer Chris Perez drops to get to work by 4pm.  He had gone 2-2 (4(-3)) at his first tourney with us, so we invite him back for more!!<br>
<br>
Game 5 features Greg and Chris at the top table, both 4-0 with 98 diff for Chris and 81 for Greg.  If Greg gets a piece of Chris by more than 8 cards or so, the others might have a chance to catch up.  Well, push comes to shove (if that were the case Greg would mash Chris into the ground with about 100 pounds difference betweent the two of them!!)  Chris eeks out a 12 card win to solidify the top spot.  Andy Talaga earns a timed win against Rich Baliban and effectively knocks himself out of major contention too.  Gus got beat by John Lolli by 22.  John and Chris match up in game 6.  John needs a 21 card win to beat Chris, and Greg would have to win by more than John if John beat Chris to win.  <br>
<br>
Game 6 was something of an organizational nightmare at this point.  Pete Flamini decides his tummy is more important than salvaging a 2-3 start and drops to get some food.  I also got a little confused while trying to sort out the command cards and I had to repair the bottom 8 games 4 times until I got the allegiences straight (It was all Pete's fault!! ;-)!!)  John and Chris also started while game 5 was still underway without saying anything to me (I assumed they were playing for fun since I hadn't made game 6 pairings yet)  When I made the pairings they kept on playing and I had to start them over (got some looks for that...)  Anyway, once underway the game ran smoothly and we were able to wrap up at about 5:55pm and give out prizes and stuff by 6:05.  Chris ends up beating John by 22 and Greg beats Joe Young to come in 2nd.  <br>
