Ok, San Jose, once again, is the proving ground for this tournament, and it will be another classic, small-town tourney with around 13 ppl to show. Just have fun reading it, and itll make this write-up worth it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Prelude<br>
<br>
If you all didnt know, SW is a dying game to me. I no longer feel the knack and the challenge the game once gave me. While its still fun occasionally, it gets dull fast and it hasnt been the same since about a year ago. Hopefully, something in Reflections 2 would jolt up the game again....at least for me. With Death Star II being out so long, its amazing I havent already quit.<br>
<br>
Wednesday comes around and me and some friends get our case. I pick 2 boxes from the case and both had the Han toppers. I get every story card except Talon, which isnt a big deal(I also traded for it later)....I was, however, disappointed from the insane amount of foiled ships I got from my 2 boxes, where everyone else pulled characters like Crix and EPP Luke, I got dupes of Independance and Z-95 Headhunters.....ugh. I was also missing some Combo cards, and the good ones too....well, kind of.<br>
<br>
I go home that night and I get that jolty feeling every time a new expansion comes out, and sit down and examine the new cards, half of which end up doing nothing for me. I get a call Thursday night from Eric Brummel, one of the guys who I split the box with. Turns out hes free this weekend and he has the urge to play after getting a Mara foil in his 2nd box. San Jose or Modesto....that was the only choice left....and Eric says San Jose is closer(sparing any comments from his folks), so we head there on Saturday. <br>
<br>
Now, I need a LS deck. My mind being fed candy from all the new cards in front of me, I made the new LS objective. No tricks, just straight-foward, hardcore smugglers. If it wasnt 3 A.M., I probably wouldve made another deck, but oh well, thats the way things go. I wake up the next afternoon(yes, the next afternoon), and call Eric and within a few hours hes at my door and were off. We get there on time for once, and the competition there is anything but stiff, just Matt Smith, who returned from Boston, stood in my way to winning the whole thing. <br>
<br>
The Decks<br>
<br>
LS: Watch Your Step....man thats an ugly picture....and whatever that.....thing.....is on the front.<br>
<br>
DS: MKOS.....a different version of Stimmed Jims on Decktech, just chill at the Palace and win.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THE GAME<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: DS MKOS vs. Nick Stefankos LS Profit Ewoks<br>
<br>
This game was pretty standard. He starts Mighty Jabba and Chall for me, and the Engineer converts the sites first turn to cut his activation. He gets out the Endor sites but he cant find Ewoks to put there. I set up the AC third turn and I drain for 4 the rest of the game. He cant get into the AC, so he sets up the Bo Shuda/ Order to Engage combo to try and drive out Gailid, but I dont move him since Scum helps the damage. He tries to set up a late drain on Endor, but my aliens and droids knock them off. In the end, Scum saves me from the 3 a turn at the AC, I deny his Han and he never set up his retrieval, and I win by 13.<br>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 2(+13)<br/>
Highs: .....Winning would be one....<br/>
Lows: Nothing much, it wasnt a bad game....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS WYS vs. Nick Stefanko’s DS TDIGWATT <br/>
<br/>
This game pretty much fell into place for me. He sets up on Cloud City fast and I send Han to Bespin fast to stop his flipping and drain for 2 a turn early on. I flip a few turns after with some people to the Cantina, and he sets up Dark Deal. Right after, I drop Battle Plan ditch Insights for Menace Fades and get that to work, killing his drains. He tries and sends a few hit squads to Tatooine, but nothing to keep me off and knock off Menace Fades for more than a turn. With all his guys at CC, he tries to fight Han off Bespin(thats a big NO), only to have Lando return the favor and make the Falcon a Legend......after that, I hit a Kessel Run and drain him to the point where he cant pay anymore for drains, and I win by 20.<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 4(+33)<br/>
Highs: Nothing much....my LS actually won one...<br/>
Lows: Having played and beaten Nick twice....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Steve Daniel and I break to hit the drug store for a drink and a snack. We come back in time for the third game, and Matt Smith is up first and Im in 2nd. Nick(the TD) lets him PICK the side he wants...so Im screwed...if you cant guess what side he picked, you shouldnt be playing....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS WYS vs. Matt Smiths DS BHBM Bomber Hell<br/>
<br/>
He owned this game. Prophetess(for a lack of Xizor) to the Cantina first turn and I cant react to him that quick, and eat about 15 drains from there fast that lasts the game. I get Luke out and Vader takes him after seeing his deck is stacked with tons of high destiny bombers. I relocate Luke, which turns out to be a mistake after he wins every duel even as I draw 6’s and 5’s for them. Add this to his TIE retrieval, and space drains, and thats the end of that. Loss by 33.<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 4(+0)<br/>
Highs: Nothing much<br/>
Lows: Nothing much....thats what I pretty much expected from my LS.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS MKOS vs. Alex Stefanko’s LS HB Mains<br/>
<br/>
This game was decided in about 10 minutes. I set up the Palace and leave Mighty Jabba alone there for a few turns. Alex comes in with EPP Obi only to get None Shall Passed. I back him up with Ephant from hand, Boelo from Power, and Gailid from the AC text. He activates 13 at this point, and drops EPP Obi and EPP Leia, Battle Plan and initiates, but I play Projective and now hes stuck. I check my hand and find Sniper, but no one has weapons so thats weak....I drop Bib with Power, Mara from hand, saber from deck, and EPP Fett from hand, First Strike, and initiate. I look at my hand again....Sniper....which also happens to be a Dark Strike. I hit Obi with Mara and he gets Dark Struck. Leia takes out Gailid, Fett his Mara, and I kill Leia by 32 in that battle. From there, Alex doesnt do much but sit back and draw out. Win by 33. <br/>
<br/>
Final Score: 6(+33)<br/>
Highs: Going 3-1<br/>
Lows: Nothing much....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well this was a free tourney to Nick gradually dismisses everyone after the last game. I take 2nd behind Matt, who rightfully crushed that stupid LS. Going 3-1 in a tourney after a few months of not playing isnt too shabby, had I brought a better deck, I mightve won. So, did this tournament get my spirits back up? Yes. It did, for the most part, but I just wish I had made a decent LS for this.....anyways, once again, I have proved, and we all learn(all together now), that....<br/>
<br/>
LS SUCKS.<br/>
<br/>
And thats all I got to say about that.....<br/>
