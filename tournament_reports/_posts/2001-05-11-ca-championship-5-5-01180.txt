<blockquote><font class="bfont"> This was it, when almost all of the greatest players in Cali battle<br>
to see who’s #1.  The championship was run at A-1 Comics in Roseville,<br>
not far from Sacramento.  Mike Hardy was to be the TD.<br>
<br>
So I hook up with Nick Stefanko and his station wagon in Pleasanton &amp;<br>
make the trip to Roseville with his brother, Alfred Dong (who I <br>
predicted would win the championship), Steve Daniel, and Andrew Meewis.<br>
It was by far the most uncomfortable trip of my life, sitting in back <br>
on a ROCK HARD seat, and virtually no room at all for my legs.  It was<br>
absolutely unbearable, and I would not sit in that station wagon ever<br>
again.<br>
<br>
I’m still in final exam mode, but had managed to find time to modify my<br>
decks somewhat.  I had been using EBOX and Hunt Down w/unique TIEs, but<br>
changed them.  My LS was still EBO, but using Mon Cal Cruisers instead,<br>
and more EPP mains to fight on land more effectively.  My DS was still<br>
Hunt Down, but I ditched the space power and went for ground beats.  I<br>
used several bounty hunters, All Wrapped Up, and Bounties for retrieval.<br>
I also had been seeing a trend of a lot of EBO decks lately, which would<br>
rip up my deck, so I added in an ATAT cannon and TTMG.  I was expecting<br>
on playing against AT LEAST 2 EBO decks.  Unfortunately, I had no time <br>
to playtest them, so the decks were all theory and would be new for me,<br>
but oh well, I’ll have to manage.<br>
<br>
So we all get to the venue, but Hardy’s not there yet so we sit around<br>
for a while, and I see some big name players arrive. Paul Feldman, Eric<br>
"Big E" Bruen, Jeff Miller, Tray Frazier, Pete Nordstrom, Jason Makohon,<br>
&amp; the "Lodi crew" all arrive.  But as I said, a lot of Southern CA talent<br>
 was missing.  I was betting on Bruen, Dong, or Feldman to win the title.<br>
So we fill out decklists (those of us who hadn’t already done so), pay <br>
the $10 entry fee, and get ready to play.  Over 60 people are playing <br>
(65 I think it was).<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS v Steve Daniel’s Y4 Throne Room jank (Insurr, DODN/WA, ????)<br/>
<br/>
I’m confused when I don’t see Staging Areas as a starting effect.  So I<br/>
have no idea what to expect, plus this is the first time playing my new<br/>
deck, so its double trouble for me.  He pulls 1/0 DBs, but no twix sites<br/>
yet.  I pull Exec DB, then Tat DB and put DLOTS there on my 2nd turn.<br/>
He cancels Visage w/TT combo, then EPP Obi comes to battle DLOTS, they <br/>
both die.  Then he plays OOC, but doesn’t get Vader.  I drop another <br/>
Vader and Jodo, then EPP Luke comes to battle, and kills Vader, but Jodo<br/>
captures Luke.  Thats because I started All Wrapped Up (along with IAO &amp;<br/>
Mob Pts).  He OOCs a couple more times, but still misses Vader.  Turns <br/>
out he’s playing 9 OOCs!  Yikes!  Steve deploys 8D8 to Y4 War room, my<br/>
next turn I Twi’lek for YCHF to prevent odds.  Then he deploys Artoo w/<br/>
8D8 and plays HDWGITM to draw a new hand (he does it several times <br/>
during the game).  He REALLY wants to get Vader OOP.  I deploy CHYBC to<br/>
stop any retrieval he might have in his deck (turns out he uses Edge<br/>
cards), and he deploys Battle Plan.<br/>
<br/>
Now I’m paying 6 to drain for 2 at my CC and Tat Dbays (no BG systems in<br/>
my deck, I use Mob Pts to pull Executor).  Search and Destroy comes out,<br/>
he he inserts AFA 3 times on me, but only once it hits because 2 other<br/>
times he had EPP Obi on table to battle.  Obi frees Luke by killing<br/>
Jodo, but I put a Bounty on Luke’s head and recap him.  By now Steve <br/>
realizes he can’t hurt me or retrieve force, so he hits me with a late<br/>
game Surprise Assault for 2 force and eventually does get Vader OOP. <br/>
In fact, he put 20 cards of mine OOP, I had no lost pile.  But I still<br/>
win by 15.  2 (+15).  I find out he plays 3 EPP Obis and 3 EPP Lukes.<br/>
So when I capped Luke that really hurt him.<br/>
<br/>
Best: Coward &amp; YCHF earned their card slots in that game.<br/>
Worst: Paying 6 to drain for 2.  Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS v John Monroe’s ISB Big Blue (IAO, Mob Pts, SSPFT)<br/>
<br/>
We’ve played this matchup several times before, and I’ve never lost to<br/>
John’s ISB deck, but I didn’t know how Mon Cals would fare.  I started<br/>
ANSB and luckily drew Battle Plan in my opening hand.  So as I was <br/>
setting up EBO he pulled Exec (w/Mob Pts), Exec DB, and Piett w/Command.<br/>
He got Merrejk and eventually put them at Exec DB, while pulling all<br/>
his systems out.  I draw into Staging Areas and Haven, great for me.<br/>
He pays 3 to drain for 2 at Endor while I setup Haven on Hoth &amp; deploy<br/>
Defiance w/Hassh’n aboard.  I use EBG to pull my Rogue pilots and get<br/>
Luke and Hobbie in Rogue 4 at the North Ridge, establishing Menace<br/>
Fades.  He avoids Hoth and sets up at Fondor, Kashyyyk, and Endor.  He<br/>
uses Den of Thieves and an ORS to kill my Hoth drain &amp; I’m looking<br/>
for a Signal to pull Strikeforce (so he can’t cancel my space drain).<br/>
I drop 3 more cruisers to Hoth (-1 staging areas, -1 EBO, -2 Haven, so<br/>
they deploy for 4 force!), and move a couple cruisers w/pilots to<br/>
Endor.  His other drains are only 1 each thanks to Menace.  He just <br/>
runs most of his fleet to Hoth, taking advantage of the fact that his<br/>
other ships are safe since my cruisers only deploy to Hoth.<br/>
<br/>
I battle at Hoth, he loses a couple ORS (he has flipped by now), and<br/>
I move from Endor to Hoth.  He never deploys to the ground to satisfy<br/>
Battle Plan, but he does manage to block Menace Fades for a turn so he<br/>
pays to drain me for 3 at Kashyyyk (Chirneau adding to the drain).<br/>
I’m ready to do some Edge retrieval, when the TD says we have 1 minute<br/>
left.  Jeez, we’ve each still got over 20 cards left, so I know we <br/>
won’t finish.  Time is called, and he’s got 29 cards to my 24.  *sigh*<br/>
Timed Loss by 29.  2 (-14).<br/>
<br/>
Best: The deck seemed to work well.<br/>
Worst: John is a slow player, plus I think I was playing slower than <br/>
normal since I was playing the deck for the 1st time. Fun game though.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS v Norman Perion’s EBO (ANSB)<br/>
<br/>
Ah-hah!  Didn’t I say I’d play vs. EBO?  Well, my opening hand stinks.<br/>
No Vader, ATAT, Cannon, or TTMG.  But when I pull the Exec DB, I see<br/>
I activated the Cannon and Blizzard 1.  So I draw those up.  Just <br/>
need TTMG and a high ability pilot (like Vader or Mara).  He sets up<br/>
EBO turn 3, with some Baragwins.  They’re retrieving everything he’s<br/>
losing to Visage, so I Twi’lek for CHYBC to stop that gay retrieval.<br/>
By now I have Mighty Jabba at CC DB, Xizor at Tat DB, and Lando at<br/>
Exec DB (after I deploy Lando, he loses General Lando to Visage, lol).<br/>
So I leave them there and deploy Blizzard 1 with Vader and the Cannon.<br/>
He gives me look of amazment like he doesn’t believe what he sees.  <br/>
He drops Sullust w/Haven and Gold 6 w/pilot there.  I’m hoping I draw<br/>
high enough to kill EBO so I don’t have to eat that drain.  On my turn<br/>
I play TTMG, and he just groans, I say I need to draw a 2, and I draw<br/>
a 2, so the MPGs are gone, ANSB is gone, and most importantly, EBO is<br/>
gone, along with 8 of his life force.  Too bad I didn’t have Mara,<br/>
cuz she could’ve beat down a Baragwin badly.<br/>
<br/>
Later during that turn I deploy the Executor to Sullust and move Lando<br/>
aboard.  I also deploy Search and Destroy.  So he’s losing to S&amp;D,<br/>
Visage, and my drains.  And he can’t retrieve.  As the game goes on I<br/>
transit my guys over to Hoth, to kill the Baragwins.  I battled at <br/>
Sullust and drew a 6, so Gold 6 and pilot died, along with Haven.  So<br/>
Lando ruled space in the Executor.  Win by 32.  4 (+18).<br/>
<br/>
Best: CHYBC and TTMG earned their card slots.  I would’ve died<br/>
horribly to this deck without those cards.  The Baragwins are<br/>
retrieval machines!<br/>
Worst: No Mara to infiltrate Hoth with.  I had to transit guys over.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS v Steve Daniel’s BHBM (IAO, Mob Pts, ????)<br/>
<br/>
I think he also started Crush, but I could be wrong.  Anyways, he<br/>
gets Emp and Janus to Endor DB, DLOTS to CC DB.  I start ANSB and<br/>
deploy destiny 6 Luke to DLOTS.  I get Battle Plan out early to make<br/>
him pay to drain, but can’t find Haven.  So I setup EBO and drop 2<br/>
cruisers to Hoth.  Hobbie and Zev in Rogue 4 go to the North Ridge.<br/>
His turn he beats the hell out of Zev and Hobbie.  Tempest 1, <br/>
Blizzard 2, and Fett hit the Ridge, and I lose Zev and Hobbie and<br/>
stack a card.  Hobbie goes to the Bacta Tank.  So I pay for my space<br/>
drain, and decide to let him have the Ridge.  I move to Chandrila to<br/>
activate more force, leaving Hoth empty.  He drops Chimarea w/Ozzel<br/>
&amp; another pilot to Chandrila, I move back to Hoth, he follows.  Now<br/>
I’ve got Haven, so I drop 2 cruisers, Lando in Falcon, &amp; RL in R1 <br/>
to beat the hell out of the Chimaera (power was 50 to 19), but he <br/>
just Ghhhks.  I drew a 6 and 5 for battle destiny.  Then I split my<br/>
fleet between Chandrila and Hoth.  He drops Zuckuss w/4LOM to<br/>
Chandrila, but I barrier Zuckuss.  I deploy I’ll Take the Leader to<br/>
make him power 2, then battle to kill Zuckuss plus 6 overflow damage.<br/>
I had Ackbar and Hassh’n there, but I forgot to use Ackbar’s text at<br/>
the start of my turn to pull Thaneespi.  That could’ve been a nice<br/>
beating on Zuckuss (power 2 and NO destiny!).<br/>
<br/>
Now I own space, and he spreads on the ground so I deploy Wedge, RSL<br/>
on Rogue 4 and shuttle Hobbie there to hold the Ridge.  He deploys<br/>
another Chimaera w/a couple pilots later, but steers clear of my <br/>
fleet so he can drain for free (he has Carida out).  But my drains<br/>
are much bigger, and I eventually kill the Chimaera again (not in<br/>
a beating though), and drain him out for the win.  Win by 8.  <br/>
6 (+26).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Deck seemed to work well yet again.  Only 1 card got stacked.<br/>
Worst: I deployed a LOT in this game.  Plus Vader and Emp were<br/>
draining me all game.  Where were my EPPs?<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS v Tray Frazier’s TDIGWATT (IAO, Mob Pts, Crush)<br/>
<br/>
I start ANSB and as I was doing that, he got Emp, Janus, and Mara<br/>
w/saber all at the CC Db with a POTF there.  Drain of 4!  Ouch.<br/>
Times like this I wish I was playing EBOX so I just use an xwing to<br/>
cancel it.  Oh well, I eat that drain and get Haven on Hoth and put<br/>
GL in G1 and a cruiser there along with Luke and Hobbie in Rogue 1<br/>
at the Ridge.  Menace Fades is out, so he’s draining me for 2 now.<br/>
HE comes at me with Dengar w/gun and Lord Vader to the Ridge, I<br/>
barrier Vader.  On my turn, I Ice Storm and he’s really pissed when<br/>
I do that.  So Menace Fades is back, and I’m draining for 4 at Hoth <br/>
now since Launching the Assault is out.  He drops Chimaera w/Guri<br/>
and Thrawn and battles, sending Ackbar to the Tank.  He has his<br/>
Order out whoch makes his ships immune to attirion&lt;8, so I need to<br/>
get a new Order out.  I deploy Lando in Falcon and Home One to Hoth<br/>
and kill Guri and Thrawn, he runs to Chandrila and puts 2 more <br/>
pilots on it.  I move Home One over with Luke and Wedge, RSL aboard.<br/>
He stays there, so on my turn I deploy Liberty and EPP Han there &amp;<br/>
smash the Chimaera (drawing 2 high destiny and cancelling his draw)<br/>
and now I own space.  The big space drains shortly end the game.<br/>
He only deployed Bespin, CC DB, CC West Corridor, &amp; a 1/0 Dbay.<br/>
Win by 10.  8 (+36).<br/>
<br/>
Best: I’m liking this light deck.<br/>
Worst: The deck for some reason just can’t win by very high <br/>
differential.  I’m 4-1 but with really low diff, even compared to<br/>
the people who are 3-2.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS v John Monroe’s HB mains (Insurr, Staging, Squassin)<br/>
<br/>
I’m thinking its an auto-win here.  John has played this deck since <br/>
the dawn of time, and it seems he always will play it.  I figure<br/>
I’ll capture his guys, and retrieve w/Bounties.  It started off <br/>
well when he put Ben Kenobi w/stick to Tat DB.  I put a Bounty on<br/>
him and deployed Bossk w/gun and Dr. E/Ponda and battled.  DLOTS <br/>
was at the CC DB.  I capped Ben w/Bossk, so he took him over to<br/>
DLOTS.  He’s activating 10 force, and drops Jedi Luke w/saber,<br/>
battles, steals Vader’s stick, hits Bossk (barely), plays SATM/BP<br/>
to make him lost, then hits Vader w/Ben.  I draw a 5, so Ben <br/>
revives Luke.  But now Ben and Luke are at my CC DB, and I couldn’t<br/>
believe how badly that went.  Anyway, EPP Vader went to Tat DB,<br/>
I deployed CC Prison, deployed Lando aboard Tempest 1, and moved to<br/>
Vader’s site.  Then I deployed Sim and Emperor to Vader’s site.<br/>
He put Wedge, RSL and Mirax with Ben and Luke.  I moved everyone<br/>
(except the Emperor) to Ben and Luke’s site, adn he moved away. <br/>
<br/>
That continued until we heard "5 minutes left."  Like I said, John<br/>
is a rather slow player, but its partly my fault cuz I was talking<br/>
to him about stuff, which just slows everything down even more.  I<br/>
was mad at myself (I didn’t want a timed win), so when I moved my<br/>
guys over to his guys, I used Sim to check his destiny, and he had<br/>
a zero on top.  I knew I had a 5 and 4 on top, so I decided to duel,<br/>
but who would I duel first?  Both had sabers, so I picked Luke (he<br/>
is harder to duel).  I had more life force than John, so I could’ve<br/>
let things progress, but I didn’t want a timed win.  He draws a 0<br/>
and 3, but plays Glancing Blow, so he wins the duel.  I’m in shock,<br/>
(like Norman was when I played TTMG), and I lose my 9 force.  Oh<br/>
well, I had to risk it.  A timed win would’ve been just as good as<br/>
a loss for me.  When time is called, he has 27 to my 19.  Timed<br/>
loss by 27.  8 (+9).<br/>
<br/>
Best: None really, I needed to battle him so I could duel and use<br/>
Tarkin to cancel on of his destiny.  But he wouldn’t stick around<br/>
to battle.  I thought about picking up Vader, but I never had <br/>
enough guys to back up Vader with.<br/>
Worst: Really boring game, it really was just those 2 battles at<br/>
the start of the game, then just avoidance.  I guess that’s why I<br/>
started talking to him, cuz I was bored.<br/>
<br/>
John decides to drop at this point since he’s got 3 timed wins and<br/>
one loss.<br/>
<br/>
Game 7: DS v Pete Nordstrom’s Profit (Insurr, Staging, Wise Advice)<br/>
<br/>
I start Mara and EPP Fett.  I deploy Exec DB, JP Dungeon, Tat DB, <br/>
&amp; DLOTS to the Tat DB all 1st turn.  He draws.  When Vader drains,<br/>
he plays Lost in Wilderness, but draws a 1, so Vader’s safe.  He<br/>
deploys his CC DB, and deploys BoShuda.  I deploy my CC DB, I <br/>
deploy Lando and Tempest 1 there, so Lando w/Ax is not a worry <br/>
anymore.  I also deploy Mara’s saber and CHYBC.  I move Fett &amp;<br/>
Mara outside to JP.  He deploys EPP Obi to Vader and they kill<br/>
each other.  I deploy EPP Vader and Tarkin, then deploy Search &amp;<br/>
Destroy.  I know he wants to free Han but doesn’t know how he’s<br/>
going to occupy 2 BG sites.  I keep deploying every turn, and I’ve<br/>
got Emp at Tat DB, Jabba, Fett, Mara, and 4LOM at JP, Vader and<br/>
Tarkin at my CC DB, and Dr. E/Ponda and Lando in Tempest 1 at his<br/>
CC DB.  Where would you deploy?  He puts Ben at Tat DB, and <br/>
battles the Emp.  I draw low so I lose 2 force.<br/>
<br/>
I move Vader and Tarkin over, but he runs to CC DB (which is now<br/>
empty since Vader and Tarkin moved to Tat DB).  Vader &amp; Tarkin<br/>
follow Ben, so he deploys Orrimaarko to battle the Emp with a <br/>
tracked 6, I draw low so I lose Emp and 2 force to Orri’s text.<br/>
Ben moves over to Orri’s site.  I move Vader and Tarkin over.<br/>
He deploys Mirax in the Chamber and I realize he’s going to transit<br/>
Ben to CC DB to occupy 2 BG sites, then free Han, so I blindly<br/>
duel Ben, drawing two 5’s to his two 1’s, and he just scoops up<br/>
his deck right then and there, so I win by 23.  10 (+32).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Don’t try those blind duels at home, they’re dangerous.  :P<br/>
Worst: Both Pete and I had planned on doing better than we were<br/>
doing, so I can understand him being a little pissed.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8: LS v Jeff Miller’s Endor Ops TIEs (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br/>
<br/>
He pulls Wakeelmui and every 1/0 Dbay there is.  I start ANSB.<br/>
He draws for a while, I deploy Battle Plan and get EBO by turn 2.<br/>
I put Liberty and Zev at Hoth, he drops 2 Interceptors and 2 <br/>
Dreadnoughts (I barrier 1 of them), battles and of course plays<br/>
APTW.  I lose Zev to the Tank and Liberty to the used pile since<br/>
he outpowered me by a good amount.  Oh yeah, he had SFS out too.<br/>
So I deploy GL in G1 w/Zen aboard and move them over to Wakeelmui.<br/>
Hobbie and Wedge are in Rogue 4 at the North Ridge.  He deploys<br/>
Janus to Endor DB to satisfy Battle Plan, and deploys 2 more<br/>
Interceptors and a Dread to his Sullust.  I’ve got Haven in hand<br/>
so I can go to either system, but I fear his text on Sullust (I<br/>
lose 8 force if he cancels Haven).  I decide to hold off on Haven<br/>
and put RL in R1 at Chandrila.  That also satisfies Menace Fades<br/>
for me so he’s not draining for as much.  He drops an interceptor<br/>
w/cannons and blows up Red Leader.  Now I drop destiny 6 Luke to<br/>
Janus, he barriers, then runs Janus to the Bunker.<br/>
<br/>
I decide to deploy a Cruiser to Hoth, then put down Haven and<br/>
deploy Lando in Falcon &amp; another cruiser.  He deploys an <br/>
interceptor to Wakeelmui and deploys Emp’s Sword to Hoth, battles,<br/>
and plays APTW so I lose a cruiser, and since I draw low on both<br/>
draws he just loses a TIE.  He moves his fleet to Wakeelmui (he<br/>
had been moving it from Sullust to get it closer to Wakeelmui)<br/>
so Gold Leader and Zev run away.  Then we hear "only 2 minutes <br/>
left," and I’m wondering where the time is going.  Jeff is playing<br/>
slowly, but I didn’t think an HOUR had passed already.  Anyway,<br/>
I do 2 On The edges but he still has 24 force to my 20 force when<br/>
time is called.  I honestly don’t know where the time went.  Does<br/>
it sound like all that happened in an hour?  Well, it did.  Timed<br/>
loss by 24.  10 (+8).<br/>
<br/>
Best: I owned all the BG sites.<br/>
Worst: He owned most of the BG systems.  TIEs are just too fast<br/>
for my deck I think.  An why is my LS timing out?  I’m not a slow <br/>
player at all.<br/>
<br/>
So I finish 17th place with a score of 10 (+8).  What terrible<br/>
differential, huh?  Here are the top 6:<br/>
<br/>
Alfred Dong 14 (+111)<br/>
Paul Feldman 14 (+100)<br/>
Paul McKelvey 12 (+120)<br/>
Jason Makohon 12 (+104)<br/>
Alexander Sheynis<br/>
Kyle Ishimaru<br/>
<br/>
Alfred and Paul played in the final, with Paul winning both games,<br/>
thus earning the title of State Champion.  Alfred used his Hunt <br/>
Down v Paul’s WYS, with Paul winning by 2 or 3 force, then Alfred<br/>
played his Y4 Throne Room deck v Paul’s SYCFA manipulator deck, <br/>
where Paul won again (they didn’t count the diff).  Congrats to<br/>
Paul, and thanks to all of you for reading.  Back to studying for<br/>
finals.<br/>
<br/>
Props to:<br/>
Alfred for getting to that final.<br/>
Paul for winning the final.<br/>
Paul Mckelvey for doing waaaay better than I thought he would.<br/>
Kyle for doing waaaaaaaaaaay better than I thought he would.<br/>
Phil Green for doing waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than I thought.<br/>
Steve Daniel for actually winning with that light deck.<br/>
Nick for the ride.<br/>
Mike Hardy for running the tourney.<br/>
<br/>
Slops to:<br/>
Nick’s station wagon, that wagon sucks.<br/>
Alfred for losing to Paul’s WYS deck.  Somehow he let Paul back in<br/>
that game cuz it looked like Alfred had it locked.<br/>
Mike Hardy for being late. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
