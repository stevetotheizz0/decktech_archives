<blockquote><font class="bfont"> "I have aquired this in a game of chance." (Brian: there’s no other<br>
place to put it in this report!) So I finally get to bring a buddy of<br>
mine, Levi Buck. He’s played StarWars for awhile, but he stopped a<br>
couple years ago and has never been to a tournament before. We struggled<br>
to build a DS deck a couple weeks ago, and he called me and told me he<br>
wanted LS asteriods, so I build him a simple awing sanctuary deck. I’ve<br>
been wanting to build an awing asteriod deck anyway, so I figure I’ll<br>
let him test it out for me. We finish the LS deck at my house and eat<br>
our pizza, then head over to Shaner’s Outer Rim. Don’t get confused;<br>
it’s the OTHER pink building behind the Whataburger! It’s nice to have a<br>
tournament 5 minutes away instead of a half hour drive. I decide to<br>
change my DS from PalpyOps to a Hunt Down w/ duelling and MAD tracking,<br>
and my LS is a HB fake Mains + Toys with MAD tracking. I’ve been working<br>
on my tracking since I keep miscounting by 1! I need to get better at<br>
that. I have to get Levi back by 11:30, and the games start at 7:00. So<br>
when 7:30 passes by, I’m getting worried. We finally start, and I’m<br>
paired with Robert Seymour, a guy I’ve never played before, but that I<br>
know. Here we go.<br>
<br>
GAME 1: HD vs. Robert’s Tatooine Operatives<br>
<br>
That’s right, he starts the Operative objective with Tatooine. I don’t<br>
know, either. I have no idea what to expect and no clue what effect to<br>
start with. I think I finally wound up with Battle Order, but I don’t<br>
remember. He was kind enough to give me my 6th Force for my first turn,<br>
so Darth Vader visits the DS Docking Bay. He drops EPP Luke, so Vader<br>
needs to take a trip. I pick him up and prepare to drop EPP Vader next<br>
turn instead because I want that boy sliced into little tiny pieces. He<br/>
drops EPP Leia and EPP Han, so now I know what the deck is. I drop the<br/>
lone EPP Vader anyway and initiate a battle. I play You Are Beaten on<br/>
Leia (when Luke’s gone, she can’t drain although Han can). TO NO AVAIL!<br/>
Did you know Weapon Lev cancels You Are Beaten? Neither did I. So I<br/>
settle for hitting Luke and losing 12 Force. This is what kills me; I<br/>
could normally come back with that loss, but I LOSE LORD VADER AND CHOKE<br/>
VADER AND DARTH VADER TO THE LOSS!!!!! Yes, that’s 4 Vaders (including<br/>
EPP) in one battle. Yeah, that killed me more than anything else. So I’m<br/>
holding onto my last Darth Vader (I KNEW I should have put a 6th Vader<br/>
in the deck!) knowing that HE CAN’T DIE!!!!! I drop Fett against the<br/>
Spiral and Nien Nunb with a 6 tracked, but he barriers Fett. I have 5<br/>
Force left and Zuckuss. DRAT! My little army chased Ben around Tatooine,<br/>
but I never catch up to him due to the way he placed his sites and<br/>
docking bays. He drops Harc Sef with Ben to cancel my drains DRAT! for a<br/>
couple turns. Visage eventually does me in. This was a fun, very<br/>
interactive game despite the outcome.<br/>
<br/>

0 (-6)<br/>
<br/>
PROS: Lots of interaction, good tracking by me, killed Luke at no<br/>
expense<br/>
CONS: Um, let’s see... how about 4 VADERS!!!!! Playing Tatooine Ops,<br/>
losing YAB, Fett getting barriered with a perfect 6, Harc Sef.<br/>
<br/>
So that was frustrating. I lost to a TatOps deck. I ran out of Vaders in<br/>
the first couple turns. I’m ready to avenge myself with my LS mains and<br/>
toys deck. But here’s the catch: I have to play Jared. Maybe I’ll wait<br/>
until next game to avenge my loss...<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2: HB vs. Jared’s Bring Him Before Me<br/>
<br/>
Okay, my starting hand has Luke JK, EPP Luke, EPP Leia, DoS, and some<br/>
other scout. I don’t remember who. For the rest of the game, I would<br/>
draw no other characters besides Luke and Chewie. I search for Dagobah<br/>
first turn; Dagobah is activated. I settle for Endor with Strike<br/>
Planning blocking his generation and draw Dagobah. I drop it next turn<br/>
and search for Yoda’s Hutt; Yoda’s Hutt is activated. He Twileks for<br/>
Search And Destroy, but it never hits the table when he realizes I’m not<br/>
playing space. I gave Vader my JK Luke from the deck because I didn’t<br/>
have enough Force to do it from my hand. He didn’t drain on the Tat DB,<br/>
which was too bad because I had a Lost In The Wilderness with his name<br/>
on it. I took out his non-stop onslaught of Walker Fodder, but I died so<br/>
often it wasn’t even funny. He caught my first Insertion Planning,<br/>
making it impossible for me to track my 6 destinies. He eventually<br/>
stacked 7 cards on his Luke turner, but he won every single duel, making<br/>
it impossible for him to turn my Jedi. I finally got down to Cracken and<br/>
EPP Obi in my hand, but I didn’t have the Force left to do some carnage<br/>
in the Throne Room. I can’t lose the duels anymore and he turns Luke<br/>
with 3 cards left in my deck.<br/>

<br/>
PROS: Um, maybe, um, well, ahh, um... is it getting hot in here?<br/>
CONS: No tracking, drawing crappy destinies to boot, only drawing luke<br/>
and chewie, not getting Vader lost, not leaving 2 Force for Insertion<br/>
Planning<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that was ugly. But Jared’s a good player, and I can still make a<br/>
decent showing, right? Well? Am I right? Okay, don’t answer that. I know<br/>
I’m scrubbing now. Levi won his second game, so I’m happy for him, that<br/>
evil bum. He wants to play a fun game while everyone else is having<br/>
pizza, so I break out a DS2 precon and start a game. He freezes Jendon<br/>
first turn for a loss of 8 (Honor should be in precons!), and I’m<br/>
satisfied to stay on Endor and drain. Anyway, our game gets cut short as<br/>
the next round begins.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3: HB vs. Stephen’s Tatooine "Sands Of Giants" scenario<br/>
<br/>
He didn’t have time to build a real DS deck, so he was using the deck<br/>
from Scot’s tourney long ago. I tried to remember the deck I had built<br/>
for the event, but I couldn’t remember the specifics. I was just<br/>
watching out for jawas and tuskens. Luke JK and DoS ran around Tatooine,<br/>
avoiding his army. He had a G-Stick, and I can’t use my weapons! I must<br/>
find a way to get around this little error in strategy I seem to have<br/>
made. Anyway, I’ve got Chewie of Kashyyyk and Gen Solo at the Endor DB<br/>
for an easy drain of 1, a destiny draw, and the ability to cancel one.<br/>
He drops Lord Vader and Tarkin, and we battle away. He cancels my battle<br/>
destiny, and I use Insertion Planning on him to track a 6. He draws a 3,<br/>
so I don’t bother to cancel it. I lose a Force, and we all live. Next<br/>
turn wipes him inside out. You see, the previous turn I had just drawn<br/>
up Draw Their Fire and Frozen Assets. I was planning on having fun with<br/>
some assault-less troopers, but this was just too much fun to let pass.<br/>
I drop EPP Obi, Tawss, and Wedge to Endor, Clash Vader, Draw some Fire<br/>
and Freeze his assets. I initiate a battle (forget to retrieve Clash!),<br/>
swing at Tarkin, and draw the infamous 6 (tracked) for destiny. I even<br/>
called it. So he loses Tarkin and 22 more. The Grand Moff leaves some<br/>
blood stains on Vader’s jacket as he watches from afar, but there is<br/>
nothing he can do. He can’t even Ghhhk because of Draw Their Fire and<br/>
Frozen Assets.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, a couple Skywalkers are still bouncing around Tatooine. I<br/>
finally get a weapon lev and ask Jared for a specific ruling on reacts<br/>
and just and who gets first action and all that to make sure I do this<br/>
right. Lord Vader paid a visit after being beaten off Endor, so he’s<br/>
here, too. I battle, he reacts, and I weapon lev his G-Stick. That’s<br/>
nice. And I even remembered to retrieve one this time. I get to use my<br/>
sabers! I slice a couple guys, knowing that I don’t have the numbers to<br/>
kill the Dark Lord. I lose DoS, and he loses his hit guys plus a cadet<br/>
to cancel the rest of it. DRAT! We ran around the planet a little more,<br/>
then we battled again. I was trying to wear him down with the drain of 1<br/>
on Endor, but it wasn’t working. I realized that my top destinies were<br/>
good, but I didn’t know what my third was. I destroy Vader and rip him<br/>
limb from limb over and over again, celebrating the evil joy I got from<br/>
it (I drew a destiny of 12 for the saber hit). He draws a destiny, and I<br/>
draw a 4. I lose Luke and Houjix the rest, he loses Vader and some other<br/>
scrub. So I’ve played solidly, made no mistakes I can think of, and used<br/>
my strategy and tracking skills to the max. Now I realize that I have 6<br/>
cards left, and he has a drain of 6 coming up. What happened? Before I<br/>
activate my last turn, I search for a general. Lando isn’t there, but<br/>
I’ve got 2 Obi Kenobi’s. I activate it all, drain him for 1, and draw,<br/>
hoping I can get something useful. In retrospect, I could have used the<br/>
Spiral to react to his drain, but it wouldn’t have mattered. He still<br/>
would have killed me with the other drains. It really puzzles me how I<br/>
lost this game. I played great, then I just kinda ran out of cards. The<br/>
very last card I lost was ironically my last 6.<br/>
<br/>
FL by 7<br/>
0 (-30)<br/>
<br/>
PROS: Tracking like a mad mother *shut your mouth!* the entire game. I<br/>
had the 6 lined up every time I needed it. I’m finally getting better at<br/>
this. Someone even commented after I had drawn my 6 for battle destiny<br/>
the 7th or 8th time in a row "That guy’s a tracking madman!" I felt good<br/>
about that one. Royally raping Tarkin, using my cool Draw Their<br/>
Fire/Frozen Assets tech that I learned from the Mega Tourney Saturday<br/>
night. Stealing a Gaffi Stick. Using Transmission Terminated to cancel<br/>
the Monnok that wanted to eat my 2 Jedi Lukes. Did I mention the Tarkin<br/>
battle already?<br/>
<br/>
CONS: Still managing to lose somehow. I think my mistake was dropping<br/>
everyone at Endor and not being able to get them off the planet.<br/>
<br/>
So that really pisses me off. I was doing great, then I just ran out of<br/>
cards. Yeah, it sucks. Whatever. So now I get the bye because I suck so<br/>
badly. I watch Levi’s last game. He’s playing his Asteroid Sanc against<br/>
someone’s Hunt Down. I played my Hunt Down against his Sanc deck before<br/>
we came, and he slaughtered me by nearly 30 points. Sanc really takes a<br/>
toll, even if it’s just at 1 system! He manages to destroy his opponent<br/>
through a few mistakes, but at the end of the game, asteroids take out<br/>
the Avenger, Fett, Zuckuss, and Bossk all in one stroke. Sanc at 3<br/>
systems for 4 Force each + drains at the Big Ones + Rebel Fleet +<br/>
Undercover Spies = Levi won. So he won both LS games. And he’s never<br/>
been to a tournament before. For crying out loud, he only saw the deck<br/>
for the first time a couple hours ago! He’s only played it twice, both<br/>
against me and my playing style! He came up 4(-40), not bad at all! I<br/>
ended with 2(-30) for a 2nd to last place. Levi finished 4th to last,<br/>
and Brian Choongphol went undefeated and won the thing. I pull a Liberty<br/>
in my prize support, thank the maker that it’s not a TTO, and give it to<br/>
Levi. I should have played with the asteroids and given him my HD deck.<br/>
I scrubbed out hard. I don’t really know why I’m playing so poorly<br/>
lately. I’ve got decent decks, I’m just not doing something right. I was<br/>
"borrowing" a modified version of Brian Hunter’s HD deck today, just to<br/>
see what other variations on the objective are doing. I’m gonna steal<br/>
some other deck ideas while I’m at it just to find another little nitche<br/>
that I can call my own. I’ve got ewoks for LS, but I need something for<br/>
DS now that PalpyOps is all but retired.<br/>
<br/>
The Good:<br/>
Shaner for holding a tourney a couple minutes from my house!<br/>
Shaner for giving unheard of prices on SWCCG stuff. I can’t post it<br/>
online, but email me privately if you’re interested in the best prices<br/>
in town.<br/>
Everyone who came for making it a fun, sanctioned event. Even though I<br/>
scrubbed, it was still fun.<br/>
Levi for coming and doing incredibly well at his first event.<br/>
Me for finally tracking without any mis-counts<br/>
<br/>
The Bad and The Ugly:<br/>
Shaner for having 18 million Outer Rim Scouts that span the entire floor<br/>
length of his store. :-P<br/>
Jared for catching my tracked 6 destiny card!<br/>
Levi for beating me in rankings.<br/>
Everyone else who beat me in rankings! ;-)<br/>
Me for losing without the aid of mistakes<br/>
Me for not having money to spend on product. I used my lunch money for<br/>
next week just for the entry fee! Yes, StarWars IS more important than<br/>
eating.<br/>
<br/>
It was a good event, thanks to all who came. See you next time! YJ on<br/>
Sat, and Type2 on Sunday, I believe. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
