<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Me and Baroni (Deck and Steebo)decide to hit the CT tourney in terryville because we had a blast last weekend with Andey Klema and Cody Dicara, and figured we would make this tourney something special. We already knew that the tourney would be big because Brentson and Karl Sundberg always go to the tourneys in the twin cities of Connecticut (meriden and terryville) and of course andy klema.  All three of the above named are in the top 7 of the region.  Baroni is 9.  So with four out of the top 10 Kashyyykians attending the tourney would prove to be sweet as hell.<br>
<br>
I pick up Baroni at 830, tired as @#$% from a party the night before.  We are taking my moms accord (obsidian 69) because my @#$% slut sister who everyone thinks is hott took the brand new jetta (outrider)- me and steebo’s vehicle of choice.  So we are cruising along and steve had a dance last night and he was like "@#$% IS PHAT" cause he hooked up.  And i was like i met this hott girl at a party who wanted my @#$% and had these leather pants on.. she had been at the dance.  She tried to hook up w/ baroni but he was getting his @#$% on already.  So we almost hooked up with the same girl at different places in a span of 5 hours. We think that this is funny as balls.  We are laughing so hard that we miss the exit for I-84.  and have to back track and we lose a half hour.  <br>
<br>
The rest of the ride was balls, except when we got gas we got such random @#$% stuff for food it was funny.  And i blocked in a van full of soccer girls and they couldnt leave for like 10 minutes casue they were blocked from the back too.  @#$%ing idiot soccer girls.<br>
<br>
We show up at this church after steve ran around town looking in all these other churches with me tailing him in the OS69.  We finally get in with like seconds to spare.  Fill out our cards, throw Endor Occupations in our dark decks and get ready to tear @#$% up.  Since Steve aint writing a TR ill tell about his @#$% too.  <br>
<br>
Me?  I’m playing Tj Holman’s skrillings and Andy Klema style Watch your step that celebrates and cantina shuffle beats.  Steve is playing huntdown 7’s as per, and Avatar’s QMC modified with balls @#$% All my Urchins tech.  My rating going in is 1628, steves is 1909<br>
<br>
Game 1 - My WYS vs. Klema (1970 +) playing MKOS non-swarm<br>
<br>
So im like @#$%, i have to play klema.  I love andy like a brother but hes so much better than me so i am sweating.  Lucky for me i played like a hunter during this game (brian, hayes, eric; take your pick).  Anyways i have Luke alone and talon, mirax, wedge chewie chillin and draining.  I have Han, melas in falcon and dash in ourrider at the system.  Im draining and stuff.  And the early drains just hurt him.  he’s draining me too but i start celebrating.  He tried to sandwhirl my lone luke, luckily i have Control in my lost so i play it.  He’s got Mara and Ig draining at the Cantina and i cant do @#$% about it cause its hurting me for 3.  So i decide to play Cantina brawl out of my lost and i @#$%ing get mara, dumb luck and he loses her.  Thats pretty much game aside from some GREAT plays out of my lost.  The other two were great but i also got to on the edge (i think) and barrier.  Either way i was able to win some battles with playing Ints out of my lost.  That part of the obj. is so key.  I was pulling them off so nicely that he thought i was doing it twice a turn, but i wasnt i was playing it for real.  It was a great game and i dont know how i won.. but i did; by 11<br>
2(+11)<br>
<br>
Good: Me playing ints out of my lost pile<br>
Bad: nothing but beating a friend<br>
Ugly: I hate when people beat good players cause then everyones like "HOLY @#$% YOU BEAT HIM AWESOME" yet my friend is standing right there, it feels @#$%ty<br>
<br>
Baroni won by big with his 7s.  But the kid complained because steve was telling him to hurry up and the kid got flustered because we are out of state or something and the kid was @#$%ing after.  Of course all of CT backed him up and i was the only one who could get baroni’s back.  So i was like.  Baroni isn’t your god, if he tells you to hurry up tell him to @#$% himself.  And the swear words pretty much shut the kid up.. but it didnt convince him to take a shower, so we pair up for game 2...<br>
<br>
And of course its me vs. Klema again<br>
TJ’s mkos skrillings vs. Klema’s WYS<br>
<br>
This game is another classic battle.  As i play like the balls @#$% scrub that i am.  I set things up pretty early, and luckily i start pulling mad skrillings.  I have my audience chamber set up, hes draining for 3 in the heart and im not happy about it.  He also has fades out and thats killing me, so i lose both galids cause i have no space practically.  Actually i have zuckuss and bossk (my only ships) but htey woont stand up to the falcon with ourrider backing him up.  So i lose those too.  but early on i get 10 skrillings and drop em to Leia and Luke and someone else’s site.  He has to lose like 37 battle damage and i draw a 7 and cancel one of his destinies with pote and the obj.  So get this, he loses leia and the other dude, and then he loses luke and old ben’s him TWICE.  @#$%ING TWICE!!!!!  So he only has to lose 7 off hte top...... im pissed.  And i never get the den of theives out.  I retreive big with the skrilling sbut it wasnt enough with him celebrating and draining in space and picking off my skrillings.  He also retrieved pretty big with some on the edges that i couldnt get secret plans out.  SO i end up losing only by 6... i wouldve won if i had gotten the den of theives out<br>
2(+5)<br>
<br>
Good: only losing by 6<br>
Bad: I never get the den out so it doesnt suprise me.  <br>
Ugly: Him only losing 7 when the BD was 37.<br>
<br>
Baroni won again, i dont remember to who.<br/>
So we are just chilling, Instead of starting round 3 and then going to get soda.  Radke and some other dude ( i dont remmber who) goes and gets soda.....like 16 bottles of soda and leaves us there waiting for like an hour.  Baroni plays brentson.  Baroni plays my hoth clouds, and brentson plays the Skrillings.  Baroni wins but brentson is a funny bastard during this game and proves to us that he is not all that unsocial like he is when he comes to MA. Me and Baroni decide that Brenston is a good guy on this very day.  <br/>
<br/>
So we wait and wait and get the pairings.<br/>
I’m playing my WYS vs. Brian Hollandsworth’s HD Dueler with sick Destiny<br/>
<br/>
This kid does his huntdown thing.  I do my WYS thing.  I drain he tries to bring it to luke with vader and duel.  I dont think so i play Run Luke Run even though its like 3rd turn blind duel.  I’m like "why are you blind duelling you will lose vader" hes like i play sick destiny.  I’m lik whatever so do i.  So i challenge him to duel me again, saying i wont play RLR out of my lost.  So i beat down vader and he leaves the table.  I lay some nice beats on him a couple of times.  All the while I’m celebratin and doing the cantina shuffle.  It’s working like a charm.  He is getting low so he starts not making us lose to Visage, but im in the lead so i make him do it.  He tries to duel again.  I keep my word and dont play RLR.  He plays Focused attack, i sitll dont cancel it beacuse i have balls the size of iceboxes but when it comes to SWCCG a brain the size of a walnut.  He draws 6,6,1 i draw 5, 1 we tie and i make him suck a @#$% and hes out of Luke Duellers.  I clash vader later on and beat down tarkin hardcore.  He loses more force and im definitely winning this game.  So i misstrack my 5 from the duel and lose lando to an off the edge.  I just do some celebrating, place vader out of play with like 36 cards in his lost.  And drain him out winning by 6.  Which is okay because his rating is way higher than mine.<br/>
4(+12)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Winning again! Tying the duel.<br/>
Bad: Losing by low. Mistraking<br/>
Ugly: What the @#$% was i thinking not cancelling the duel???<br/>
<br/>
Baroni loses with his dark to brenston which sucks but his diff is really high still. <br/>
<br/>
Me and steebo decide to hit mcdonalds because we didnt want to pay for the @#$% pizza they ordered.  We invite anyone but noone says anything so we peace out of there and leave the door open.  We hit the MACDONALDS and baroni scrubs out and makes me pay, and break a dollar for like 7 extra cents of change cause he was too lazy to run to the car, even though we needed dollars for tolls.  Anyways this brilliant counter lady decides to give us great directions to I-84 on the way home that will cut our time in half.  SO we are pumped about getting home early.  We bring the food back, talk to people like Greg West and Baroni hits on his girlfriend and we play some Ghetto War, Cody goes out first and i kicked some @#$% but baroni won the rectenna from me in a war so that sucked.  We didnt get to finish but let me say brentson was great while we played.  He is part of Ghetto Squad so i felt wierd with him there, but he was laughing his @#$% off while we played adn when people won zeros with 6s.  I wish he woulda played he wouldve made it fun, he was being totally cool; once again.  So we quit ghetto war early for the round four pairings...<br/>
<br/>
Its my MKOS vs. Cody Dicara’s HDWGITM Cloud City (Cody’s Gay @#$% Deck)<br/>
as we like to call it.<br/>
<br/>
We call this CODYS GAY @#$% DECK, because that is exactly what it is.  He wins with the deck sometimes dont get me wrong but he could just use QMC!  It’s alot like Avatars QMC only it uses HDWGITM to pull other stuff as well.  In this game i didnt get one of my three grabbers in my opening hand, so i couldn’t grab the Mess first turn.  Luckily he only messed twice in the game because i guess he got alot of characters the second time he did it and didnt want to lose them.  Cody decides to spread and drain, he put obi at the site where guys with sabers are power plus two, han and leia at the site where you can pay to cancel drains (which is a site you shouldnt play in your deck, it gives them drain of two and can cancel your drains if htey get it.. play the incinerator!).  I go to beat down ben with skrillings even though it took me like 5 turns to get them, and i had already been drained out alot, and been drained myself.  So Ben dodges or Narrow Escapes or something gay after i retreive my two.  And we just both drain the hell out of each other, and i am starting to run low, because he is harc seffing my drain at the palace, and paying to cancel my drain at Cloud City.  I cant take it anymore and i move skrillings over to stop the drains.  I go after his guys on tatooine with the barge a merc pilot and some skrillings.. He clashes the pilot so im pretty screwed but one of my skrillings stays around long enough fo rme to battle and retreive.. I lose the barge and my clashed merc.pilot was able to be lost with it because he was on it... which saved me from a beatdown that wouldve lost me the game.  I retrieved with Abyssan Ornament before beating down some guys in CC, and then retreived some skrillings while i drained him out in the palace.  Also somethin of note: Cody off the edged, and i grabbed it even though it is lost, but stopped a retreival jamboree when he subsequently on the edged for the big 5 force.  Even with that 9 force pull, i was able to hold him off.  Full Win by 23<br/>
6(+35)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Retrieving.  Getting out the Den.  Losing the pilot<br/>
Bad: Nothing really, i dominated the game.  Maybe not grabbing stuff.<br/>
Ugly: Not getting one skrilling til the 3rd turn.. i play 16<br/>
<br/>
Baroni beats klema so he is 3-1 also.  We think we are going to end up playing, but we dont.  Baroni and Klema play again, and i have to play Greg West.  Greg west is a little known about, but pretty highly ranked player.. this was not a pretty game<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 - My Tj’s skrillings vs. Greg West’s WYS w/ RFC’s<br/>
So Greg West opens up and is kind of a schmuck to me.  We have been cool all day, he brought his GF and it was her first tourney so everyone was helping her, and he was talking to us so i thought he was nice but he was trying to talk @#$% so i was like wahtever, i can talk a good came ask erik hunter or rennek.  So he claims hes playing palace raiders but i dont htink he is (and he wasnt) none the less i grabbed the narshadda on the first turn.  I set up preatty early, but he had two docking bays going with i’ll take the leader.  I tried to go to space but he beat me off (hahahha) and he had too heavy drains on the ground.  He was celebrating for like four once he invaded the palace, and took out boelo and bib at the lower passage.  So i was stuck with a drain of 4 to his drain of 7 plus 4 retreiving.  Once again i didn’t get the den of theives out.  I couldnt lay any beatdowns.  He retrieved.  He got out traffic control and drew up big.  I only had like 8 cards and knew he would Celebrate and Traffic Control his way to big diff, so i drew up when he had 15 cards left.... Full Loss by 15<br/>
6(+20)<br/>
<br/>
Good:Nada<br/>
Bad: Todos<br/>
ugly: Greg West’s gf<br/>
<br/>
HAHAHHAHA im just kidding but that was hte first thing that came to my mind becuase it would be the ulitmae dis!!!! actually his g/f was pretty cute and really nice, no qualms about that i am just a bitter loser ask john mullarkey.  And just as an additional disclaimer: THE JOKE ABOUT GREGS GF IS JUST THAT -- A JOKE SO SHUT THE @#$% UP<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Baroni beat klema again, giving the Connecticut boys a rough day against Baroni.  Brentson lost.  So going into the last game, Baroni still had a shot.  I dont relaly remember who he had to play.  This may have actualyl been the game he played Klema again and not the one before.  Either way it didnt matter, and youll find out why soon.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 - My WYS vs. Cody Dicara’s MKOS nonswarm<br/>
<br/>
Okay, Cody plays an identical deck to Andys which I beat in game 1, and andy is a better player than Cody.  Normally MKOS is an auto loss to WYS so im feeling pretty confident.  However, Cody gets jabba and a JP site in his opening hand and apprently that was what did it for him says he.  I dont think my WYS deck ahs enough characters even though it won two of its games.  This game i was able to get the cantina shuffle workign to retreive.  But his drains were too high in the palace, i didnt get menace fades going til late, and of course like cody always does, gets both of his ships first turn and laid a beatdown to han in the falcon while he was all alone before i could fortify.  I really didnt even get to flip my objective.  He cancelled my celebration with occupation before i could even get beaten out of hte air.  Things just didnt go my way.  I blame it on me Tunnel Visioning first turn for celebration in fear of losing it off the top instead of grabbing the falcon to Squass my way to victory.  He retrieved too much and i tried to save myself in the end game by on the edging but i miss trakced first and then when i tried to play it again i realized ididnt even have a rebel with ability &gt;2 to do it to.  So i lost, big time.. by 22.<br/>
6(-2)<br/>
<br/>
The Good: Once again, nothing went well this game<br/>
The Bad: Cody getting a monster god opening hand<br/>
The Ugly: Mistraking again... i really suck at that<br/>
<br/>
Baroni won again going 5-1!  He came in third and got shafted AGAIN by not getting the third foil out of 3... that foil was given at random and Greg Wests woman got it, Which is cool cause she has no cards and clash is a good foil to have and use.  Greg West won, Karl Sundberg got second.  Brentson got fifth i beleive.  Me, Cody and Klema took 8,9,10 not in that order. we all went 3-3 with mad low diffs.<br/>
<br/>
So all in all it was a phat tourney.. now for the Mcdonalds ho slut tech!!! that lady gave us false directinos and me and Baroni beleive that she did it just to @#$% with us but she made us an hour late!  We listened to the BC game on the radio while trying not to get pulled over by the cops and called it a night.  I had to do laundry becuase i was going to leave to go back to good ole’ marist college the next morning early in the outrider.<br/>
