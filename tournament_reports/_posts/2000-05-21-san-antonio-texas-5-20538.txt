<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Texas vet Kevin Martilla hosted his farewell event on Saturday, drawing a fairly big crowd, including Decipher's own Jedi Knight, Justin 'Juz' Pakes. <br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
I will start off by saying this wasn't my best event. I took an anti-Hunt Down Throne Room deck with SAC, mains, and the Super Falcon. For the dark, <br>
I played a Tatooine Occupation deck with mains counters out the wazoo. I was so close to running my HB Odds deck, and it probably would have been a <br>
better choice, but I wimped out. <br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
Game 1 Vs. Justin Pakes' Hunt Down Numbers deck<br>
Alright, I get to face the Jedi Knight himself. This man was a gentleman, and a good sport. I liked him right off the bat. On to the game. I do my TR<br>
jump and he starts with IAO, I think. Awww, I guess I ain't Nabruning to cancel Visage. My draw wasn't that swell, but his didn't appear to be either, <br>
as we both did little for the first few turns. He set up Image of the Dark Lord at the Holotable and set up a steady drain I couldn't screw with. <br>
Meanwhile, I was searching for a damn site I could drain at. A few turns later, he suddenly drops two droids and an insert, and I am thinking, 'Oh, crap.'<br>
I had nothing for DS Numbers, and I knew this was gonna be rough. I activated full amount, and used the Swamp text to push the insert back down. Finally, <br>
I set up a drain of three at the Cantina, but Battle Order was down, forcing me to activate. A few inserts hit, costing me about 10 cards each. He goes<br>
into space with some Dreadnaughts and such, and I begin to search for Han to complete the Super Falcon. As I activated, another insert popped, leaving me<br>
only the Super Falcon in hand and exactly 11 Force to deploy them with. He is getting rather low on cards as well, so I think I am in pretty good shape, <br>
as I had previously deployed Mos Eisley and was draining him for 4 a turn. But, he puts in another insert, and I know I can't avoid it, as I am drawing <br>
those three destiny in space. His next turn, he makes the winning play by Lateral Damaging the Falcon and drawing two tracked destinies to wipe the Falcon <br>
out, causing Battle Order to ruin me. Visage and his drains killed me by making the insert pop.<br>
Full Loss by 7<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
Highs: Playing Juz. He is a very solid player and knows his decks. Also, never having his suicide Vaders nail me. <br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
Lows: Not having any Numbers defense and Lateral Damage.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
Game 2 Vs. John 'farmerhot' Farmer's wacky TR Mains deck<br/>
Damn it! I have to face a teammate. Oh well, at least I sort of know what is coming. He starts TR and I guess he is playing his kooky ASP/Ewok Catapult <br/>
mains deck. It is nice tech, but he never saw it come to fruition. I get out the Audience Chamber and Mara with Saber first turn. He draws. I draw a bit <br/>
and find Vader with Saber along with a Tatooine drain +1 site. I move Mara over to JP and wait. He drops Ben and Tawss on top of Mara and kills her. I don't<br/>
care because I have Circle in my hand and Ben doesn't have a saber. I replace and old Vader with the EPP and move over and Circle. Bye Ben. That was pretty <br/>
much game, as I took over Tatooine and drained him to death. <br/>
Full Win by 30<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Highs: Circle. It's old-skool gold, boy!<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Lows: Beating up on a friend. Losing control of the Tatooine system to an early Super Falcon.<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Game 3 Vs. Brent Y.'s Dagobah drain/retrieval deck<br/>
This was a weird deck. He starts Yoda's Hut and Signals for something. I really was not sure of what he was playing, but I anticipated kook. I set up Occupation<br/>
quick. He tries TK-422 to block a drain on Mara, but I Sniper him quickly. He uses EB's to try some On The Edge and Off The Edge, but I Sense them all, which kind<br/>
of hurt as he had Do, Or Do Not down. But I will lose three cards to prevent him from retrieving six. He puts out an Arcona, who I immediately kill with Bubo. He<br/>
cannot withstand the 8 cards damage I am hitting him with each turn, and I pull it out easily. <br/>
Full Win by 26<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Highs: Occupating early.<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Lows: Do, Or Do Not nailing me for like 15 cards. <br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Game 4 Vs. Aaron Pawlik's Death* start Mains w/ heavy SAC<br/>
This game was decided by the fourth turn. The deciding factor was a big SAC war early, man does that bring back some memories. His first turn he deploys the Back<br/>
Door and the Cantina, so we both are activating monster amounts. I got kind of screwed on my mains, as it took a few turns just to find a Master Luke. I dropped him<br/>
at the Cantina early. He responds with Mara and ECC 4-LOM. I am dreading this, as I have no back up mains and Savrip isn't out yet. But, he draws a site somehow and <br/>
curses as Luke stays and Mara dies to a Smoke Screen. I deploy the only character in my hand, Tawss, to back Luke up. Again he responds, this time with Vader and a<br/>
Lightsaber. He battles shoots Luke and hits Tawss with the Saber. I playing Courage and Glancing Blow, which he tries to Sense. I welcome it, as I have two Alters and<br/>
two Senses in my hand. I Alter, he Senses, I Alter, he Senses, I Sense, he Alters, I Sense, he Alters! What the hell? I had like 20 cards in my hand and he had 6. What<br/>
luck. Nevertheless, that would cost me the game, as he did whatever he wanted for the rest of the game. <br/>
Full Loss by 18, I think. <br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Highs: Him drawing a site when all he needed was a one.<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Lows: Losing an eight card SAC war. <br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Game 5 Vs. Brent Y.'s TIE Fighter Swarm/Retrieval<br/>
I play the dude who I beat once, so I am expecting a vendetta factor. He starts Milwaukee and Seinar, and I am praying to get an Alter in my starting hand. Unfortunately,<br/>
it doesn't happen. Again, the start is slow for both of us, as we can't find locations well. Finally after activating and saving up about thirty Force, I Tunnel Vision<br/>
for a damn Alter, as they were all in my Reserve for the past three turns (looked using the Swamp text). I Alter Seinar, thinking it should be a cake walk from now on, as<br/>
I draw the Cantina, Masta Luke and Anakin's. He deploys another Seinar the next turn along with a TIE to retrieve the other Seinar. Oh, well, there goes that idea. He sets<br/>
up in space, and I set up the Super Falcon thanks to another Tunnel Vision. I wear him down by Altering two Dreaded Imperial Starfleets and the Super Falcon with Savrip.<br/>
Full Win by 25.<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Highs: Tunnel Vision rocks.<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Lows: Not finding the cards I needed early. <br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Game 6 Vs. Juz's master deck, Juz's Revenge<br/>
I expected this. I also expected it to be a hell of a fight, as I know the suicide mains are gonna cause me some trouble. I got Resistance out by the second turn, but he <br/>
deployed GLinG1 to Tatooine quick along with another Odds and AFA. Oh, crap. I had to be careful with my activation, and since niether Zuckuss In Mist Hunter nor Boba In <br/>
Slave 1 were no where to be found, and I didn't occupy three battlegrounds. I put Resistance back into effect with Jabba Du Hutt at JP. I knew what was coming, a beatdown.<br/>
And I got what wasn't on my Christmas list: EPP Luke and Tawss Khaa on top the fat ass. He battles, hits Jabba and draws a five. I draw a five as well, but still had to <br/>
suck up eight extra cards and the fact that Resistance was no longer in effect. Next time I activate the inserts both nail me, and I am getting really low on Force. He <br/>
gives Gold Leader some reinforcements in space, and deploys Battle Plan to clinch it. <br/>
Full Loss by 17.<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Highs: I Circled his EPP Obi. <br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Lows: Not finding a ship to save my life. <br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Well, I go a very disappointing 3-3. My rating will remind me all about it. Oh, well, it's not about winning or losing its just about having fun (yeah right). Juz completely<br/>
schooled me with his cheese and I liked it. He is a class act. I have all the respect in the world for him. <br/>
The winner of the tournament was long time second placer Brian Guthrie, directing guru. It was his long overdued first tournament win. He can thank me for posting my Revo <br/>
deck, which he whipped everyone's ass with, including Matt Lush, the deck's originator. :) Way to go, Brian. You deserved it more than anyone. <br/>
&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
Monster props to Kevin Martilla for running a fab event. Kev will unfortunately be leaving us for Japan shortly. Best of luck Kev. Your abscence will scar us (actually I find<br/>
it be rather a beneficial thing for my Star Wars future, as you always spanked me. :)<br/>
