<blockquote><font class="bfont"> I’m only writing this because I’m procrastinating on a paper for class.<br>
<br>
12 players showed up for this local tourney in Rochester NY. My light deck was a janky Profit and my dark was SYCFA TIEs w/Cannons.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
Profit against Adam Nobles (1477) Hunt Down with 3 of each duel card.<br>
He forgets to put guys in the Chamber but I tell him to and he puts Mara and Xizor. First turn Choke Vader drops to the Chamber and he flips.<br>
I get a killer hand with Jedi Luke, Anakin’s and Run Luke Run so I pull the Home One DBay, drop DBay 94 (also in hand) and the Jedi on Home One, transit him over to Tatooine and flip HDADTJ back.<br>
He moves Vader over to Tat: JP and puts Tarkin with him.<br>
I put Lando there and move the Jedi over.<br>
He wants to blind duel the Jedi and I’m like .... no thanks. Run Luke, Run!<br>
So he YABs Luke (where’s my Weapon Lev?) and beats the piss out of Lando for some overflow.<br>
My second Lando says "You Will Take Me To Jabba Now" and comes out of my deck to the Chamber, Ben drops by too and so does Tawss. Exclude Mara, beat on the Prince for a whole bunch, play Captive Pursuit so Han is released. No Secret Plans, I retrieve. Cool.<br>
Luke is still Beaten and we both lose to Visage then Vader moves back into the Chamber and duels Ben. Well Vader’s a pretty Focused Attacker so Ben bites it along with 9.<br>
I come back with the Jedi and the Waxy Lando and crap and Adam never finds another Obsession so Luke wrecks shop.<br>
Eventually with a little help from Weapon Levs, Blaster Deflections, and Jedi Presences I wipe Tatooine clear of Imperial slugs and win by 13.<br>
<br>
Yay: Fun, fast-paced game. Adam wanted a rematch with same decks so we played again, that time I found my Courage of a Sky and beat Vader in a duel.<br>
<br>
Boo: Ben got smacked up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
My TIEs against Rich Buckner’s MBO 1497<br>
Yeah he’s playin the goofy blow up the Death Star deck.<br>
At first he has me worried because I do start SYCFA and all but then I think how good could a MBO deck really be?<br>
He gets Farmboy in R2/Red 5 to Yavin early for a drain of 1 that I can’t shoot at without a Flawless Marksmanship.<br>
So I activate and "search for a Shocking Revelation" with Secret Plans but really to see where the FMarksmanship is.<br/>
This goes on for like 4 turns. I activate 10ish and every turn the FM has been shuffled and is still in reserve. He’s only draining for one and looking for Death Star blow up stuff.<br/>
Finally I’m down to like 10 cards in RD and one is the FM. I have a 12-card hand and a 30+ card force pile. I say @#$% being Flawless, I’ll just track destiny - and I play a Masterful Move for nothing.<br/>
Then he puts Capn han in the Falcon and Premiere Red Leader in Red 1 to Yavin too.<br/>
Well screw that I put down three TIEs (all I had in hand) and the Cannon on one, Fighter Cover Admiral’s Order, initiate, shoot the Falcon down easy and shoot Red 5 with the tracked MMove. So it’s 3 TIEs against Red Leader, but he’s being Pursued Relentlessly so his power = 0. Battle destiny of 2 and I dont draw one, so Garven and his ship go down to cover the 10 battle damage (one of my TIEs was power +3 for Cover).<br/>
Anyway he eventually blows up the Death Star but who am I kidding that doesnt matter. I retrieve most of the force I lose to that with the Emperor’s Squads and other random TIEs and drain him out at Yavin, a PotF’ed Kashyyyk, and Endor.<br/>
Full win by 20s<br/>
<br/>
Yay: Shooting down Han in the Falcon AND Luke in Red 5. As Rich put it: "Give that pilot a promotion!"<br/>
<br/>
Boo: Couldnt find my Flawless =/<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
TIEs against Zander’s Hidden Mains 1807<br/>
It’s a sucky matchup for him. He gets set up with Ben and Luke on the ground but I put spies/Dark Waters or something down there plus I’m retrieving.<br/>
I get Commander MerryJack out and pull my systems and start draining away in space, so good ol’ Cap’n Han shows up with Leia providing moral support against a lone Interceptor at a system. Unbeknownst to Han he has just flown into a Heavy Fire Zone so the TIE gets a Cannon and blows him to bits. Next turn I drain and the second and last Han hits the lost pile from top of deck. I had seen the Spiral go earlier too so Z really doesnt have too many options. Draw up.<br/>
Full win by whatever<br/>
<br/>
Yay: Japanese Dark Waters<br/>
<br/>
Boo: playing Zander in the tourney, it has to happen I guess<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
Profit against Antonio Vigliotti’s ROps 1756<br/>
I show my objective and he says "well, you win" but I dont believe him. He forgets to put guys out too but I’m like do it so he puts Mara and Xizor down as well.<br/>
My opening hand has only ONE freakin character and it’s Twat Khaa. But I have Goo Nee Tay so that should help. I got 7 force first turn cuz he put out two sites so I look for a DBay with Insurrection and to check for characters: 3 Ben, 3 Luke, 2 Leia, 2 Lando. No good characters in my force pile. I put Twat in the Chamber and free Han anyway cuz he had moved Mara w/Saber and Xizor out to the Palace.<br/>
I take their drains for a couple turns while looking for guys to beat on them with ( and while he sets up RalOps )<br/>
So finally I get a Ben and put him down and chase Mara and Xizor around with Ben, Twat, and Han. But he has guys on Ralltiir so I don’t drain so it’s basically his piddly drains and my piddly Profit damage while we both draw for more guys.<br/>
Then I get the Jedi again with a stick but I have to decide where to put him. Tony makes that decision for me when he splits up Mara and the Prince, putting Mara at DBay 94 and the Prince back in the Chamber. LSJK comes down to square off with his future @#$%, swings but misses, Blaster Deflects her attempt to hit him, and Smokes up for a 6 in BD. Mara dies. Ben and his crew chase Xizor into the Chamber and Luke transits to the &lt;&gt; DB on Ralltiir.<br/>
Well Vader doesn’t want Luke there so he drops along with some 2/2 schmucks to battle Luke; Colonel Davod Jon gets a Portal dropped on him and Luke hits some other random lackey. The battle damage is pretty big though as I believe there was a walker there too so instead of losing 4 or 5 from life force I toss Luke.<br/>
Which is just as well because in his beating my Luke down Tony forgot to save force for his Xizor to run out of the Chamber. And I have another (Master) Luke in hand along with a Saber so he drops down to join Ben, Han, and Twat who were already there to smack the Prince down for game-ending battle damage. My BD’s were 4 and 5 and the Courage of a Skywalker was adding power so it was something like 28 in damage which was more than Tony had left.<br/>
Win by teens?<br/>
<br/>
Yay: Blaster Deflection, Smoke Screen, and the final battle at the Chamber. Meeting/playing a new guy from out in Cuse.<br/>
<br/>
Boo: winning a game on one simple mistake<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I’m the only undefeated so I win the tourney. Second place went to Zander and third to Jon Schulz whom I was hoping to play cuz he’s got some ratings points but he took an early loss or something and in only 4 games we didnt play.<br/>
<br/>
Good fight, and goodnight. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
