<blockquote><font class="bfont"> This was my first tourney since Tatooine came out.  I don’t know about the rest of you, but after Tatooine I’ve been having trouble making some good decks.  Especially for dark side.  And since I don’t have many Tatooine cards it only makes it that much harder for me to make a good deck.  So I’m looking at what I’ve got and I have the Dark Deal, SYCFA, and DSII helper effects.  So I figure I’ll make one of those.  I have no useful rare Tat cards for light side (except maybe 3PO), so I figure I’ll make a Profit deck.  However, the Profit deck isn’t as good as if I had Padme and Qui-gon, so I also make a RST deck and hope I can trade or borrow the helper effect for that when I blow up the bunker.  If not, then I’ll use Profit.  <br>
<br>
I decide also to use the Dark Deal objective, starting I’m Sorry, Battle Order, and You Cannot Hide Forever (along w/Secret Plans and the Casino).  Use I’m Sorry to get the West Corridor and Carbon Chamber, and I play a bit of sabacc (4 different gamblers in the deck).  The rest is just balanced between ground and space (the deck is made to flip), using mains (except Maul) and some SAC (3 and 2).<br>
<br>
So John Patchell hooks it up with the ride to Games and Cards, the place where the tourney is.  Last time I was there was a couple years ago and it was called Thunder and Lightning, but I guess they changed their name becuase people didn’t know what they sold.  John brings along Paul Tartaglio, one of our Squadron Members.  John and I talk about our decks, but Paul wants to keep his a secret from us.  Punk.  And neither of them had the RST helper.  So we get there and Adam Montgomery shows and hooks it up with the RST helper effect.  Yes!  So I’m gonna use RST, starting the helper effect, Strike Planning, and BAttle Plan.  <br>
<br>
David Chafin is the TD, and 13 people show up, so we get underway for a 4 game tourney.<br>
<br>
Game 1: DS v Patchell’s Profit (Wise Advice, DTF, Insight)<br>
<br>
I’m actually happy about playing my ride because I haven’t played John in a while.  I start Mighty Jab and EPP Fett.  I get 4LOM in my hand, so I deploy him to the Chamber, deploy Bespin and my 2 sites, and draw.  He drops Qui-gon w/stick to the Casino.  I deploy EPP Vader to Casino and<br>
OS-72-2 in Obsidian 2 to Bespin (as I said, we discussed our decks and I knew he had only 2 ships).  I battle and we both miss our swings, so I lose Vader.  I draw and I get a Disarmed!  Arggh, if only I hadn’t battled!  But I have Mara in hand too, so I’m not too mad.  He drains and draws.  Now he’s got a large hand, and my only character is Mara, so I deploy Bad Feeling Have I and draw rather than deploy Mara to Qui-gon.  He Alters Bad Feeling, I Sense, he Senses, I Alter, he Senses.  So Bad Feeling is gone.  Then he drops Ben, Master Luke w/stick, Chewie Protector (cancels 4LOM), and Yoxgit.  He bounces Jabba, hits 4LOM, and I lose 10 force and I’m cleared.<br>
<br>
So I drop Mara w/stick to Qui-gon along with Lando and dark Figrin, but I don’t battle.  He’s got 3 cards in hand, and after I Disarm Qui-gon, he drops Lando w/Ax, who excludes Mara and beats down poor Figrin for 9 damage.  So I’m low on force now, and I run with Mara to drain elsewhere and end up losing by a pathetic 31 force.  0 (-31).<br>
<br>
Best: Obsidian 2 draining at Bespin all game, letting Occupation do some damage.<br>
Worst: 2 battles for 19 damage really hurt.<br>
<br>
Game 2: LS v Ian Meadows’ Court (No Bargain, POTH, AWU)<br>
<br>
Had I lost by 4 more force, I would’ve gotten the bye.  So I pull Crix 1st turn and put him and COK and Wuta at the Landing Site, then pull the back door.  We both lose to Court the 1st turn.  He fortifies the Chamber with Guri, Mighty Jabba, and Boelo.  I’m pulling Endor sites, and I drop Orrimaarko and Lt Page to the Pit.  He deploys Xizor, Dannick, and Kitik and kills Page and eats his soup.  But I draw a 4 so he forfeits Xizor.  I flip RST and move some random scouts in the Bunker.  Gold Squad 1 w/Lando is holding Endor for me.  I deploy Cracken to the Pit and battle, but he draws a 6 so we’re both cleared at the Pit.  Then I blow away the Bunker after a couple tries and that pretty much locks the game down for me.  I put 2 more scouts to the Pit so he puts POTF on the Chamber to get a bigger drain.  I just drain him out with Midge on Endor.  Win by 28.  2 (-3).<br>
<br>
Best: Bye-bye bunker!  And he never pulled a ship using Court.<br>
Worst: Losing force to Court.<br>
<br>
Game 3: LS v Ethan Temianka’s Hunt Down (Battle Order)<br>
<br>
Ethan has been a tourney player since forever, but, like me, he doesn’t have many new cards (especially Tatooine and DSII).  So I wasn’t surprised to see him start Twi’lek Advisor for Battle Order.  Turns out he’s playing just a bunch of Fears, Voyeurs, Scanning Crews, and Defensive Fires.  And Limited Resources.  Of course, I didn’t know that, so I did my standard Hunt Dwon start.  Pull Crix to the Landing Site, deploy another random scout with him, and deploy Blount to the Holotheater.  I quickly realized Ethan had few characters and then deployed Cracken to the Med Chamber.  Then I easily flipped but couldn’t blow away the bunker since I had lost the epic event off the top to Fear (I had good stuff in hand).  So I had to rely on my Edge cards to retrieve, which they did, and I just drained and DRAINED, unopposed.  No battles at all.  Win by 18.  4 (+15).<br>
<br/>
Game 4: DS v Ethan’s HB (no starting interrupt)<br/>
<br/>
I setup on Bespin, he pulls his 5 systems (all of which are parsec 0, 1, or 2), and pulls Clak Dor VII and flips.  Gee, I wonder what his Base is.  He’s playing lots of Portable Scanners and Wyron Serper, so he says they’re destiny 8, but I thought that it was ruled he did NOT make them destiny 8, but the TD (david) says they’re destiny 8.  And Ethan uses ASP droids to stack the scanners on his deck.  Scary, but easy to win sabacc (when he stacks 2).  So when I win sabacc, I also steal a scanner each time (if its there).  Anyways, I deploy Obsidian 2 and 8 to Bespin and Cloud City to flip my objective, then move them both to Bespin.  I cant draw a ship with Hyperdrive to get to Clak Dor VII.  He drops a corvette and a couple pilots and kills my TIEs to flip me back, so I Lat Damage the corvette targeting Coruscant (the only other system he controls with the corvette, ASP droids, Wyron, and a couple pilots).<br/>
<br/>
I finally draw Bossk in ship and move him to Clak Dor.  Then I probe, but Bossk gets beat down for 5 overflow damage.  But at least I can drain now.  TK-422 had been canceling my 3rd drain, but HB can’t cancel my drains anymore.  I Monnok him and get 2 On The Edges, then when he plays 2 more later on I just Sense them both, and when he Senses my Sense, I Alter it.  I always had a Sense in my hand in this game, so when he played Tunnel Vision....Sense.  He ends up controlling Bespin and Coruscant all game, but once I got Xizor in Virago to one of his other BG systems, I didn’t have to pay for my drains and was able to drain him out since he had to pay to drain me.  Plus Sabacc was letting me retrieve and steal cards from him.  Win by 15.  6 (+30).<br/>
<br/>
I challenge John to a rematch and beat him down (only by 9), so I feel better.  Turns out Paul got 1st place going undefeated, John got 2nd (losing to the TD, David) and I got 3rd.  I get 4 packs Tatooine, Paul gets another Masterful Move foil and some packs.  Thanks for reading.<br/>
