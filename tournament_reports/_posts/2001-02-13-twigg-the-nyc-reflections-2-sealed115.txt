<blockquote><font class="bfont"> OK, break time after the constructed consisted of this... microwaving a nasty chicken sandwhich, eating a Kit-Kat, and then getting battlegrounds for like 12 people.  So Chris and I grab the binders and people start yelling, I need Mos Eisley, I need jundland wastes... it was a saad day for the binder that day, but all is well!!!  Well around like 4:10 they start, (MEGA PROPS TO THE SEALED GUYS THIS TOURNEY WAS RUN DAM SMOOTHLY!!!)  I get light side and I was hoping for dark, because the dark R2 expanded cards are WAY better than the light ones, but what are ya gonna do?  So, my draft circle had me, Doug Faust, my dad, and 3 guys (sorry forgot ur names...)  After all the drafting, here is what my deck looked like. Not great, but I was happy...<br>

<br/>
and well, Steve B.  pulled Foil Lord Vader and alpy, another guy pulled foil Jedi Luke, and another Pulled Jap Vader.  So the hush of the crowd dies down and we started.  Btw, I DIDNT PLAY MY BRO, (woo-hoo!!!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs NYC player w/ Jap Vader (sorry dude forgot your name...)<br/>
<br/>
He starts Jabba’s Palace and gets all the sites out, I start Kiffext, and drop an x wing there turn 2.  He sets up GAILID and guys at the Audience Chamber and at the Palace.  He then dropped a tie to his Tat system.  I looked in my hand and saw the Independance.  HUGE!  So I’m sucking up drains on the ground and tracking my it could be worse.  So the independance lands ontop of the TIE and he looses 6 force.  I then send my guys, (how puny they REALLY are after his on the ground.  Luke Rebel Scout join the chamber and a traked 5 clears it.  Then the Jap vader cam down, but barrier stoped him, (whew!).  My turn I dropped 2 droids and battled with that 5 again, killing vader.  Meanwhile My darins at Kessel, Tat, and Kiffex were putting a major hurt on him.  We squandered around and I eventually drain him out.  FW +23<br/>
<br/>
2 (+23)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Independance is .... big!<br/>
Bad: Gailid and Vader is NASTY!!!<br/>
Ugly: Poor lil’ tie...<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Deck and my dad were going at it for the "Battle Of Marist"  Read Mike Gemme’s sealed tr for more info... btw deck my dad awaits the second battle...<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs Steve Baroni’s Ultra Foily Deck<br/>
<br/>
He starts Jabba’s Palace, BIG surprise.  I get a god draw, and drop a b-wing to kessel, the z95 to Kiffex and an operative to the Trash Compactor.  He was flipping out, but he then dropped the shiny Lord Vader at the Junland and set up a palace drain.  He is killing me on the ground and his BARGAINING TABLE was ruthless, totally taking the sting out of my drains.  So I’m dealing him very little damage and his guys are starting to poressure me.  Leia hits the Carbon Chamber, and is visited by ALOT of his imperials and aliens.  Maybe hmmm 7-8.  So Leai eats it and i loose 7.  I then send operatives and dumb aliens and Luke into the chamber to smacsh on Palpy.  Draw their fire is VERY cruital in this late game.  I battle, he had 1 in hand and 1 in deck, limited resources leaves, and I win the battle, and the game, mainly because he didnt have an alien to canel my kessel drain that turn.  FW +7<br/>
<br/>
4 (+30)<br/>
<br/>
Good: A freaking AWESOME game w/ STEVE...<br/>
Bad: Poor Leia...<br/>
Ugly: Poor Leia...<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs Marco Habert<br/>
<br/>
Good ol’ Marco decides to show up and we hook him up with battle grounds.  So he starts the.....  Palace, yep thats right.  So he draws , and draws and draws and draws and draws.  I get NO SHIPS.  NONE, ZERO, no ootang poo, NOTHING!!!  So I get wrecked on the ground my Snoova w/ vibro, Judo w/ a blaster (he is nasty!!!) and Thrawn and a bunch of other guys.  He then has 2 ties at my kiffex and shoots the b-wing i was able to get there.  A lot of skirmishing and a good/tight game..  There is nothing really to report.  He had power and weapons, alot of WEAPONS!  And I never saw my ships.  FL -9<br/>
<br/>
4 +(21)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Playing Marco, thats really it...<br/>
Bad: Getting slaughtered on the ground<br/>
Ugly: His ENDLESS rant to Lingrell... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Albany’s Aaron Northrup get’s paired with Marco for the title match.  And a whole bunch of, if - then’s is the second match of Aaron KIngery and Chris Terwilliger.  And at the 3rd table...<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs Michael Daulton<br/>
<br/>
He starts Palace... blah blah blah, ;--), I get ships early and I got Kessel turn 3 which was hot!  So Im draining thinking everythig is kool.  Then... an Imperial Class Star Destroyer, w/ Admiral Piet and Some 3/3 guy DESTROY’s my lone b wing.  I losse a bajillion force (he only drew a 1 for destiny kinda helped!) and So i back up my kiffex drain and head to the ground.  His Retwin is getting me back into the game b/c of draw their fire.  I spread out my guys and use my destinies to fight back.  I take the chamber w/ Luke and, then he limited resources me... AUUUGGGHHH!  We all know that sux.  So here I’m thinking its all over.  But then he battled me or something, i drew a 6 clearing away his dudes at Tat : JP and My retaliation with like a rebel trooper and maybe and elom along with my drain of 4 did him in.  FW +11<br/>
<br/>
6 (+32)<br/>
<br/>
Good: A great game with Daulton!<br/>
Bad: Limited gives me the chillz...<br/>
Ugly: Poor Bwing, suked to be him, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Well Marco and Aaron Kingery were the top dudes taking home Reflection 2 Expanded Sheets, which there are only 5 sets of in Existamce! I got 4th or something, not bad.  All in all this was a really great day.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of the surprise was releaseing early versions of Qui-Gon and Darth Maul for the Ep1 Tat set...  Maul is a 7/6 with built in dueling. (not an imperial or alien a MAUL icon...) and Gui-Gon is a 6/7 Jedi Master Icon who makes aliens power -1 at same site and is IMMUNE to attrition.  Each of them had Episode 1 icons and something tells me there will be, "type II" events where only Episode 1 cards are allowed or even Objectives that only allow episode 1 cards.  We’ll see...<br/>
<br/>
