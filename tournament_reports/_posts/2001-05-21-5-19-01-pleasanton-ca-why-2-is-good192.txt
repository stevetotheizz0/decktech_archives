<br>
Pre-tourney stuff<br>
<br>
The week as always sucks.  I have tons of hw and projects flying in because finals are just around to corner.  I have to take some California exit exam on Thursday which is cool cause we get a minimum day but it was the easiest and long (5 hours of testing) day.  <br>
Friday finally rolls around and Im ready to have gathering with the crew.  Chris comes by as Im making some tunes to the deck.  He tells me Brandons probably not going so we can ride with Paul and cram into his mini Ford.  We play a few games and he has to go pick up his mom so I go and play some Counter-Stike with my clan as we lose 26-3.  We suck.  He comes back and we decide to go get some food and then swing around Pauls house to tell him the plan.  We head down there just as the pizza guy is getting to his house.  We go in and wait for them to finish eating.  Instead of playing we decide to hit some comp online which drags on for at least 2 hours.  During that time Brandon who says hes not gonna go has been calling and working things out.  After a while we decide to go play and meet up with Brandon and my house.  Brandon gets there we play some games long into the night.  Everyone takes off while Brandon and Chris crashes at my place.  We end up going to sleep around 4 so Im gonna be tired tomorrow.  We wake up and around 10 Chris comes by and were off.<br>

Decks<br>
DS:  BHBM: My way or the Highway<br>
LS:  WYS: Non-Euro Style<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
Ls vs Tim Greens BHBM <br>
<br>
Well I get to play Tim whose always fun to play against and exciting.  He starts off like normal with Rendilli and The Emperor(the cheezy one) to DS2 dbay for generation.  I drop Mirax with Pulsar to Tatooine for a fast drain.  His pulls a Dbay and drops Boba there and moves Emperor over.  I set up more droping Kessel and Dash/Outrider there flipping for more generation.  He drains plays Bad feeling Have I and  draws up some saving the rest.  I drain him and set up for a beatdown.  I Frozen to avoid the barriers and drop Artoo/Threepio, Han, Luke, Theron Nett and Talon Kradde along with draw their fire for more protection.  Before the battle he tires to shot Theron Nett and misses.  I battle hack Emp and play Blaster pro to kill him.  He misses shot on Han and I miss Boba I play No battle desitny card for him and he takes Boba and about 11 breakthrough.  He drops Vader and Tarkin to Endor Dbay hoping to get luke out of battle.  I move luke over and the rest of my guys back to tatooine.  I may have hit him for some but the fights not over.  He makes a counter attack with Temp 1 and Mara who I barrier.  I battle back shoting Mara with Han and playing Blaster Pro killing her.  He takes Temp 1 and more breakthrough he dies to my drains a few turns later.  FW(+15)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Beating a BHBM <br>
Lows:  Nothing Much<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS vs Tim Greens TRM <br>
<br>
I get to play Tim again since all the LS players won and I was bottom Light I guess.  He gets to go first which sucks for me.  He drops Goo Nee Tay (Great) along with CC Dbay and a twix and draws.  I drop Rendilli and draw some getting some good stuff.  His turn he just draws some and saves up a little.  I finally get Emp out along with Janus and move them to CC Dbay for a easy force drain.  With his force saved he plays Han, Leia, and Chewie but I Barrier Leia.  I drop Mara with a stick and I battle.  I chop Chewie and dark strike him.  He kills Janus.  I you are beaten Leia and hit him for about 11 more and he stacks.  He activates and plays Kenobi with stick who I barrier and wait.  I drop Vader and stick playing Circle on Kenobi and battleing.  I hack Leia and he shots but misses and I lose Mara to attrition but he loses more breakthrough and stacks another.  He gives up Luke on his turn and saves some.  I start moving back to duel for more damage.  He drops a few guys (I can remember exactly which) to get his activation up and draws some.  Down comes Iggy and battle.  I cap 1 of them and kill off the other him stacking another.  I go back to duel with 3 stacked but I win making him lose 3.  A few turns later I stack some low destinys and a 6 on bottom.  He draws a 5 and a 1 but I draw 1 and 2 so I lose duel and draw my stacked 6 for the game.  FW(+16)<br>
<br>
Highs: Crossing<br>
Lows:  Nothing Much<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
DS vs Alfred Dongs WYS Super Control/Tunnel Vision<br>
<br>
Well great 3rd game and I already get to play Alfred.  I start off with the same stuff Rendilli and DS2 Dbay with Emp and Janus to Tatooine Dbay.  He plays Luke out of deck who I barrier.  I drop Temp 1 next turn and battle he craks Janus but draws low.  He takes luke and about 3 stacking 1.  His turn He drops Melas to H1 Dbay for some activation and draws up.  I drain him and save up some force setting up my hand somemore.  He drops wedge with ship to kessel to even out the force drain.  I go try to kill Melas with Mara and stick and battle.  He fallen portals her so there goes that plan.  I take the 3 force drain from kessel as he piles Dash with outrider along with Theron Nutt and ship to kessel for more power along with Luke with Saber to the cantina.  I drain and go for the flip which does nothing as I set up search and destroy for some damage.  Hes been draining for some.  Here comes my biggest mistake of my entire life.  He drops down Chewie and Mirax who I barrier.  Along with A RFC battles.  He misses shot on Vader as I swing at Chewie and hit.  As I play my Dark Strike he tells me he wants to play an interrupt which is Slight Weapons Mal but its not in there so after I hit he asks if he can play a different card I say whatever and he plays dodge so I dont hit Chewie and Vader dies to double 6s which was preety much a game break.  So my Obj flips back and Luke is free.  I still have Vader in hand so I play him again but no saber so I just cap luke battle and he draws double 6s again which is preety much game after he kills off some space ships I have up there.  FW(+11)  <br>
<br/>
Highs:  Great game with Alfred even though I lost<br/>
Lows:  Double 6s<br/>
<br/>
Well as were waiting around again Nick does the pairings and I get Alfred again.  Great.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 <br/>
LS vs Alfreds ISB Big Blue Space <br/>
<br/>
So I get to play Alfred again which sucks but is always fun to play against.  He tells me he just drew it again even though he only has 1 in there.  So he pulls Exe Dbay and plays Merijek there which he says is the card he only has 1 of but he always draws it.  Fondor comes out for that cheapo Executor.  I pull that docking bay and play Theron Nutt there so he cant drop the Executor Machine there.  So Zuckuss comes down who I barrier but he laterals it to Coursant which it stays there for the rest of the game.  I drop Mirax with Pulsar Skate along with Luke with Stick battling drawing a 6 to power and 1 for destiny which sucks but oh well he loses Zuckuss and a few and Im immune to his attrition.  He pulls a system and draws saving some force.  I hit him for 1 and drop Han with Blaster to Tat Dbay flipping.  I play a few OOC which I get Vader.  He drops someone else and Executor to Fondor and moves over.  I drain for a few and set up the hand some more.  He drains for some and drops a few guys as I move mine over since I have lots of forfeit.  He battles there and I lose everything and about 3.  I drain him for more and drop a RFC into the cantina droping Luke to Dbay moving han inward.  He plays Chimera with a Few guys from Den of Theives and moves to Endor.  I drain and set up the hand a little more saving some.  He drains and drops Vader Tarkin combo to Endor Dbay covering for my Battle Order.  I go and kill them off with Chewie, Lando and Rayc.  He chokes chewie after canceling my shot on tarkin.  I draw a few high destiny and clear the site as he does the same.  Lando is sitting there on his @#$% by himself but its not that bad.  He plays a walker and battles with my draw their fire on table killing lando off.  He moves 2 ORS down to walker leave 1 ORS on Chimera.  Heres when I actually make a good move.  I drop Dash in Outrider with Melas.  I battle get 1 back and play 2x damage card I then subtract his power by 8 as he draws a 2.  I draw a 5 and 4.  He loses ORS and Chimera along with 13 breakthough!!!.  Hes left with about 4 force left which I drain him out next turn.  FW(+17)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Beating Alfred after about going 0-30 against him lifetime<br/>
Lows:  Letting him play Vader after I OOCed him.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
DS vs Mike Mendozas EBO Mon Cals <br/>
<br/>
This game started off without a Janus for the first time against Mike.  He was asking me why Emps little Buddy didn t come with him.  So Emp goes to DS2 Dbay.  He does some setting up for a signal to get ANSB.  He gets EBG along with a site as he draws a site as well.  I go for some speed Your Destiny damge with Vader to DS2 Dbay and move them to CC Dbay and draw Janus.  He gets Jedi Luke instead of Commander so I cant barrier him and get him stuck on Hoth hahha.  But He Goes with Zev and Hobbie not getting EBG out yet.  I play an overpriced cost for Janus to get Search and destroy out.  I move Janus first so he decides to play the I wanna beat Kyle card and makes me lose it.  So then I turn on kill mode and am gonna beat the crap outa him now.  He gets EBO out this turn and draws up some.  I hit him for drains as Vader gets a stick and I get search and destroy back with No Escape.  He tries for Obi and Han against Emp and Janus but I Barrier Obi so here comes hurt for him.  I drop Mara with stick and battle.  I slice obi and play Dark Strike on Him he blasts Janus.  He loses Han and about 5 and stacking 1.  I drain him for some and set up the hand some more.  Obi comes back against Mara and Emp blasting Mara and I slice Obi.  He loses Obi and about 4 more this time and stacks 1 canceling the Search and destroy.  I drain play a presence on Endor and lose my 1.  He deploys Obi and a Rouge to Hoth Dbay and moves Hobbie and Obi to North Ridge and Obi hops out.  I don t drain this turn because Im gonna kill him.  Tempest 1 with Igar comes down at North Ridge along with Iggy with gun.  I battle and cap Obi with a tracked 6 and draw a 6 and 4 for about 23 to 5 and hes dead.  FW(+24)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Beating Mike again and a fun game<br/>
Lows:  Search and Destroy being canceled <br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
LS vs Stephanie Dittmans (Pauls GF) MKOS Abyssians<br/>
<br/>
Ive played against her in play testing and have set up the beatdown everytime.  But this time is a little different.  She pulls Sail Barge with the passenger deck for more activation.  I sit there and draw setting up the hand with H1 dbay out of deck.  She draws and saves some on her turn.  I again keep drawing trying to find something.  Jabba and Ephant Mon come down to AC along with 4-lom and Myo.  I go for Mirax and Pular Skate to Tatooine for some drains.  On the ground with Talon, Artoo/Threepio, and a RFC to Cantina flipping finally.  She drains for some and drops Boba Fett with gun and Iggy with gun to Cantina who I barrier.  Here comes pain.  I play assets along with Draw their fire.  I drop Luke to Tat Dbay with Han and Chewie to Cantina.  I battle get 1 back and she loses 1.  I shot iggy with han and play Blaster Pro so he dies.  She shots Artoo/Threepio and I run Luke Run over and hack Boba.  I play Don t Get @#$%y for 5 destiny but she plays wounded wookie (even though she cant but I forgot about Draw Their fire) even though she loses Boba and like 19.  Shes gets Galid going with some Abyssians to JP and moves a guy over flipping.  I drain for some moving Luke and Han to the docking bay and waiting.  He drops Zuckuss in Mist who I barrier.  I drain and drop Dash in Outrider and Melas battle.  I reduce power and draw double while she draws a 3 and I draw 3 and 3.  She loses Zuckuss and about 10 more leaving here with 4.  She drains.  I drain her out next turn.  FW(+22)<br/>

So Lodi Crew did good today with 3 outa 3 taking the top 6.  Well as we go out to the car Alfred comes out and asks Brandon if he could buy him a shirt at Judgement Day on Sunday and we all say are laters.  As we get into the car Chris tries to start it up it doesn t start.  So we have to get a jump and re-jump it in Tracy after In-N-Out burger.  So we get Paul to meet us at In-N-Out so we can re-jump it there and get home.  We get there about 10 mins before them so were sitting there on the grass waiting.  We see them as they turn into the parking lot not seeing us but Pauls Brother looks right at us as they circle the lot 2 or 3 times.  So we go run after them and yell at Pauls Brother because he didn t say anything.  So we make it home on time and watch movies and drink Lipton Brisk and Mountain Dew into the morning.  As this happens we officially let 2 more members into Lodi Crew.  So Lodi Crew is now up to 5.<br/>
