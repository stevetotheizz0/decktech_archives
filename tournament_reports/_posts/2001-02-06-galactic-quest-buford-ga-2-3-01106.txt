<blockquote><font class="bfont"> This time of year is usually a pretty dead time for SWCCG players. No big tournaments on the horizon (usually) and everyone is getting back into a regular routine (kids going beack to school, parents going back to work). However, with the release of Reflections II, players are looking for an outlet to try the new strategies, namely a local tournament. This is pretty much how it came to be that me and the boys of Team Atlanta ended up at Galactic Quest on a beautiful Southern Saturday. Kyle (the owner of the store, as well as the tourney director) had promised us a large turnout, and we’d get to play six games. Well, only 15 people show up, but we decide to play six games anyway, because XFL games didn’t start til 8pm. <br>
<br>
Going into this tourney, I knew a lot of people were going to play WYS. Seems everyone has a Jones for the new objective. However, I had no freakin’ clue what to expect on DS, so Mike "Troop1023" Kessling and I put together what we thought would be a pretty versatile LS deck. Here are the decks I was playing...<br>
<br>
Dark: Speed HDADTJ (See "Hey Monkeyboy, another HD Deck")<br>
Light: HB Fakeout mains (See "HB Altimus" which is similar to what I played, I will not post my version)<br>
<br>
First game: LS vs. Charlie Herren (AOBS)<br>
     Happens every time... It sucks when you have to play a teammate in the first game. Anyway, Charlie is probably the best player in Georgia right now (with apologies to A.Rhodes) and I have not tested against this deck.<br>
     First thing, I get a bad draw. Only character I get is a Chewie, Protector. Charlie deploys a bunch of good sh1t while I draw up for the first couple of turns. I finally draw a Ben Kenobi, drop him at the Tatooine DB with Chewie, and transit over to the DS DB 327 where Charlie has Xizor, and Iggy w/gun. I figured I could hold out until I could get more characters, but no... Charlie (who always seems to have just the right card at just the right time) Puts all sections on alert Obi, drops Boba w/ gun, captures Chewie, shoots Obi, and draws big destiny. Needless to say, a major loss of force ensued, costing me any chance of winning...<br>
<br>
FL (-27)<br>
<br>
Highs: Saw how good AOBS could be, don’t really mind losing to Charlie<br>
Lows: LOSING BY 27 FRICKIN FORCE!!!<br>
<br>
Game two: DS vs. Rebekah Gruver (AITC w/ Chadra Fans)<br>
     Let me start by saying that Rebekah is a pretty good player, as is her brother. But more on that later. <br>
     Okay, this is a game I can win! Rebekah, who like I said is good, is still just beginning, as she can be a little timid. When I first turn flip my objective, she started throwing Lukes and Obis into her lost pile. This game was pretty short and sweet. Just me draining at DB’s and hitting her with Visage damage. Nothing real exciting,<br>
<br>
FW (+23)<br>
<br>
Highs: First win of the day, deck worked like the machine it is...<br>
Lows: I beat Rebekah pretty bad. I do not like pounding on scrubs, but it happens sometimes.<br>
<br>
Game three: DS vs. Scott Foster (Nudj/Rev)<br>
     My first thought going into this game was "Holy sh1t!! I am not packing any Evaders!" I had not thought I would see any Revo, so I did not even consider putting them in. Fortunately, this DS deck still activates massive force. Early on, I thought I was in trouble. He started the old "throne room/swamp/farm" combo, dropped a Nudj forst turn, then deployed Goo Nee Tay. Oh hell, here we go... I drop Rendili first turn, he Revos it. I thought he would Revo the Med. Chamber for sure, but he never did. Finally, on the fourth turn, I get Vader down with his stick, flip, and wait. He deployed Obi Wan and I was forced to duel blind, which is always dangerous. Fortunately, this deck packs big destiny, and Obi was placed out of play. I moved Vader to the Endor DB and waited. He is building up a force at some DB (Tatooine?) with LSJK, Han w/gun, Leia w/gun, plus some more stuff. He tried to Nabrun over, but I was holding an Oota Goota for this reason, and after all his characters hit the used pile, I drained him out in the end.<br>
<br>
FW (+15)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: tech plays like the early circle, and the oota goota<br/>
Lows: Me not packing Revo protection.<br/>
<br/>
So I was finally on the positive side. I igured I could possibly win my last three and make first or second. Heh... Light side sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth Game: LS vs. Josh Gruver (spies and TIES)<br/>
     Like I stated before, the Gruver kids are pretty good at this game. However, Josh almost forced me to kill him. During a game, I say things to mentally check off certains things going on during a game. I may say a word like "excellent" or "fantastic" to make a mental note. Josh thought this was funny, and started mocking me. Needless to say, this really pissed me off. Not to mention the fact he had all the answers to my deck. He covered all my sited with Undercover Spies, and used every trick in the book to knock me out of space. I saw Lateral Dmages, Tallon Rolls, and just about anything else you can imagine. I am not a sore loser, but when someone is mocking your playing style when you are playing, it is liable to get that person hurt. After the game, I pulled Josh aside and put the fear of GDrake in him. I explained that while he is a good player, he needs to watch his mouth because I was not going to beat a 15 year old into submission, another 15 year old might if he mouthed of like that to the wrong person. Oh by the way, I lost.<br/>
<br/>
FL (-13)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Absolutely none<br/>
Lows: Losing again, being mocked by someone I cannot lay a hand on just because he is 15 and I am 23... stupid juvenile laws... <br/>
<br/>
So I am swimming in the sea of jizz, at a local tournament no less... I gotta win these last two to salvage some pride.<br/>
<br/>
Game Five: DS vs. James Richardson (Asteroid Sanctuary, I think?)<br/>
<br/>
Once again, the Dark deck works like a machine. I see no Lukes or Obis, and set up my drains at the DBs. I go to space to deal with the meager fleet he tries to use, and he never gets sanctuary going. Kids, listen to me... NEVER DEPLOY IN SPACE UNLESS YOU CAN DRAW DESTINY!!! I cannot stress that enough... What a beating.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+33)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: No longer in the negative again... This deck is a beating and a half.<br/>
Lows: Destruction of another scrub. Hollow Victory.<br/>
<br/>
Game Six: LS vs. James Richardson (Dark Deal)<br/>
<br/>
This kid has all the luck. No not really. Because we had so few people, we ended up playing again. Bad news for the scrub. This time the deck actually works pretty well. I deploy and/or move to his sites, occupy Cloud City with Wedge in his ship and Dash on the Outrider, and just refuse to lose. ANother sound thrashing of the poor new guy... <br/>
<br/>
FW (+27)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: lightside finally wins one.<br/>
Lows: beating the kid twice in a row. Double hollow victory.<br/>
<br/>
Overall not a bad day. Ended up 8(+58). Got third place behind Charlie and some random.kid who I had never seen before. Prizes were pretty good too. Charlie took a Foil Jap Vader, and I got a Third Anthology. Everyone else got packs of RII.<br/>
