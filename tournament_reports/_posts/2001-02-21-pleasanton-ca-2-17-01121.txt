<blockquote><font class="bfont"> TR coming at you from Warmasters in Pleasanton, located in<br>
Northern California.  22 people showed for Carl "Mike"<br>
Hardy’s tournament.  I was using EBO for light starting<br>
Battle Plan, Insight, &amp; Wise Advice (deck listed on my <br>
member page).  For dark I used Court starting Mob Pts, No <br>
Bargain, &amp; POTH (but I varied my starting effects a little).<br>
The Court deck is modified from the version on my member<br>
page, but its similar.  <br>
<br>
If its been a bad day for you, you should read this because <br>
you can laugh at how bad a day it was for me.  But it was <br>
still fun.  If it hasn’t been a bad day for you, you can <br>
laugh and say how its good that days like this one don’t<br>
happen to you.  It was a 6-game tourney.<br>
<br>
Game 1: DS vs. Matt ??’s AITC Chandra-fans<br>
<br>
I deploy Kuat (for activation only) using Mob Pts, then <br>
deploy Xizor to the Chamber.  As expected, he pulls BoShuda<br>
and puts Tessek at the Pit, then moves him to the Chamber so<br>
as not to lose 1 to Court.  I pull the Barge and deploy an<br>
ORS on it, move Xizor over.  I get Hutt Influence ’cuz he’s<br>
got Bargaining Table out now.  I head over to Tat DB (which<br>
I pulled), and get more activation.  So we both draw and <br>
deploy....then he deploys a sandwhirl and moves it to the DB<br>
to make my guys go missing.  Then I inform him that they are<br>
safe at a DB since it is interior.<br>
<br>
Ok, so sandwhirl goes lost, he deploys a skiff w/ANH <br>
Chewie w/ his bowcaster and some Chandra-fans.  I deploy <br>
Mara w/saber &amp; Dr E, then move the Barge over with J’Quille<br>
&amp; Jodo, while leaving some guys to drain at the DB.  So <br/>
during his turn I Disarm &amp; operate on Chewie (the barge is<br/>
safe now), he deploys EPP Luke to kill 2 guys at the DB.  I<br/>
have Zuckuss (w/an ORS), Dengar, &amp; Bossk in ships at Tat, he<br/>
deploys Home One, Hass’n, and Thaneespi and battles.  I lose<br/>
an ORS, he loses it all when I draw a 6 &amp; 4 for destiny.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually I set up Scum w/an ORS in the Chamber, and take<br/>
control of all Tat sites except Pit of Carkoon.  If I had<br/>
setup Occupation it would’ve been much quicker, but Chandra-<br/>
fans suck, especially since he never got Kabe to the <br/>
Chamber.....and he never flipped.  Win by 32.  2(+32)<br/>
<br/>
Best: Taking out Home One so fast.<br/>
Worst: Not getting Scum until late game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS vs John Monroe’s Hunt Down (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br/>
<br/>
Well, he starts Decree once he sees EBO.  He gets Vader &amp;<br/>
Tarkin out 2nd turn to the DS DB, I get ANSB 2nd turn.  He<br/>
drops Tempest 1, Emp, Janus &amp; Sim to the North Ridge, moves<br/>
them to the Generators.  I drop Iceboy in Rogue 1 to the<br/>
North Ridge to flip him back.  We both lose to Visage all <br/>
game, I lose a bunch of xwings from my hand (i don’t want to<br/>
lose EBO to Visage or a drain).  At first he couldn’t get<br/>
Decree going, but later he just kept dumping guys on Hoth &amp;<br/>
moving them in (so they couldn’t be Ice Stormed).<br/>
<br/>
He also had mad force activation, so he was paying for <br/>
drains while I was draining for free.  Later he got Bossk<br/>
in space, but he died after 1 turn.  Then Zuckuss came out<br/>
late game, after he had cancelled my Incom Corp (my speeders<br/>
couldn’t defend the interior sites).  I had no xwings left<br/>
to deploy to him, so he was able to drain for free now.  <br/>
Even though we’re both losing to Visage, I’ve deployed much<br/>
more than him and he wins by 17.  2(+15)<br/>
<br/>
Best: Luke chilling at the North Ridge.<br/>
Worst: Him getting Decree to work in the late game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS vs Alfred Dong’s HDADTJ (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br/>
<br/>
All I have to say is this was a repeat of last game.  I <br/>
finally get a signal on my 3rd turn, only to find ANSB not <br/>
there.  He doesn’t get Vader until 4th turn, I get ANSB on<br/>
my 5th turn.  He deploys *only* to Hoth, nowhere else.  So<br/>
my speeders can;t hang with all these characters.  He flips<br/>
once Vader’s at the Ridge, but he marches vader into Hoth.<br/>
Iceboy In Rogue 1 comes down to flip him back, then I move <br/>
into Hoth as well.  Luke later died, but Vader never came <br/>
out from the shield to flip Hunt Down.  <br/>
<br/>
So we;re both losing to Visage, and he’s got Decree locked. <br/>
I can’t defend my interior sites, the best I can do is <br/>
deploy Boushh to block a drain.  I find out he’s got no<br/>
ships, but I’ve already deployed too much and I lose by 14.<br/>
2(+1)<br/>
<br/>
Best: None, except maybe keeping Hunt Down on the 0 side<br/>
Worst: Letting him set up Decree.  Couldn’t stop him.....<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS vs Shawn Ely’s WYS (Squassin, Battle Plan, ??)<br/>
<br/>
I thought this game was locked.  I had never lost to Shawn’s<br/>
WYS deck, and never came close to losing.  He played much <br/>
better this time.  He converts my Chamber &amp; gets BoShuda <br/>
there.  I deploy the Barge and a couple aliens aboard.  He <br/>
drops Artoo and plays a Gift, so I’m gonna be hurtin’ in <br/>
battle destiny.  He deploys some guys to the Cantina and <br/>
drains me for a while.  He gets Pulsar &amp; Outrider to <br/>
tatooine, I deploy some ships to the DB then move up Dengar,<br/>
Bossk, Zuckuss, &amp; Jabba’s Cruiser w/ORS &amp; Brangus piloting.<br/>
<br/>
After a couple turns, he clears me out of Tatooine and sets<br/>
up Celebration.  I’m paying for cheap drains, he’s draining <br/>
for free.  I close the differential gap when I Elis a crew<br/>
over to the cantina where I exclude all but 1 Ralltiir <br/>
Captain and he takes like 15 battle damage.  Now I’ve got<br/>
like 8 cards left, he’s got 5.  A couple turns later, time<br/>
runs out.  Lose by 11.  His celebration had <br/>
retrieved 9 force for him.  2(-10)<br/>
<br/>
Best: Showdown in the Cantina.<br/>
Worst: Losing my space fleet.  1st time WYS has beaten my <br/>
space fleet.  Because of that, he got celebration.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS vs Tim Greene’s AOTBC (starts POTF)<br/>
<br/>
He gets the 1st turn flip and deploys Guri to Xizor.  I lose<br/>
some force, then get Luke &amp; Hobbie in Rogue 4 to the North<br/>
Ridge to flip him back.  Later, EBO is up and running.  He<br/>
drops Jodo w/blaster rifle to Rogue 4 and shoots....he draws<br/>
a 4, which barely hits the speeder, making Luke &amp; Hobbie die<br/>
in flames.  He Ghhkks the damage.  He’s losing a lot to <br/>
drains in space though, so he puts Virago &amp; Stinger to block<br/>
2 different drains.  Well, he’s probably got Ghhkk, so I <br/>
don’t overdeploy to beat them down.  No Ghhkk!!  Damn, I<br/>
Should’ve deployed more.  Anyways, he still loses about 20<br/>
force altogether and the next turn the drains kill him.  Win<br/>
by 27.  4(+17)<br/>
<br/>
Best: Beating down Virago &amp; Stinger.<br/>
Worst: Jodo shooting a maneuver 6 speeder.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS vs John Monroe’s HB Mains (Insurrection, Staging<br/>
Areas, ??)<br/>
<br/>
This is a rematch from last tourney, where my Sarlacc ate <br/>
his Jedi Luke and EPP Leia and I won big.  Not this time.<br/>
I deploy Jabba to the Chamber, he drops EPP Obi there.  Not<br/>
enough force to battle though.  I drop a Merc Pilot for 1, <br/>
Snoova for 1, get his ax and capture Obi, flip. Nothing much<br/>
happens except he gets Falcon w/Capt. Han &amp; EPP Leia aboard<br/>
at Tatooine.  He OMDH to Alderaan for 9 force.  Oh no...I <br/>
can’t pull my ships when Court is flipped.  So I finally<br/>
feed Obi and its looking good for me again.<br/>
<br/>
Many of my ships are lost though, so I give up on Tatooine.<br/>
Its his system, so its only a drain of 1.  Now he’s got<br/>
Jedi Luke, Lando w/ax, Corran, and my U-3PO that he stole<br/>
w/Corran at his spaceport DB.  I have Xizor, Mighty Jabba,<br/>
4-LOM, Boelo, and Snoova there and battle.  He weapon lev’s<br/>
the ax away, fallen portal on 4-LOM, clashes Xizor, <br/>
excludes Boelo, swings and hits Snoova and I’m left with <br/>
Jabba &amp; Snoova (who is forfeit = 0) so I lose like 15 force.<br/>
He drew a 5 &amp; 6 for destiny, IIRC, while I drew a 1.  I’m<br/>
still draining for more though.<br/>
<br/>
Later, I think I’ve won when he’s down to 2-3 force, I’ve <br/>
got 7-8, but he OMDH again for 9.  Shortly thereafter, time<br/>
runs out.  Another timed loss for my dark.  Lose by 12.<br/>
4(+5)<br/>
<br/>
Best: Eating Obi-Wan (the Sarlacc did, that is).<br/>
Worst: The showdown at the spaceport DB.  Disastrous.<br/>
<br/>
You know, even though I did poorly, I still won because I<br/>
traded for some really good stuff.  I was so happy about my<br/>
trades I think I got a little distracted (I just need to <br/>
make excuses on why I lose!).  Well, it was my worst<br/>
tourney ever, and I got a R2 pack with nothing great in it.<br/>
<br/>
But still, it was fun and hopefully you enjoyed reading it.<br/>
Now I need to remember how to win games again........Mike <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
