Back again, despite the school year starting, I still manage to find some time(its early in the school year) to manage to become a TD in my area, as well as host a few events in these few weeks. <br>
<br>
That being said, I also managed to get in some action myself at local San Jose, at Comics and Fantasies this week as well, in a tourney ran by Nick Stefanko, his last before moving to Santa Cruz for college.......TR happens NOW.....<br>

<br>
Schools starting to kick in, works starting to pile, and lifes starting to get hard again, and for some reason I didnt feel an urge to relieve some pressure with Star Wars this week.......having played in several tourneys over the past few weeks(finishing 3-1 in all of them), I decided I needed a break......so I planned to just chill this week and maybe get in some action next week.<br>

But when I signed up to be a TD this past Wednesday, I had second thoughts and decided I did want to play, and a reminder on the listserv let me know about Nicks final tourney at San Jose, so I decided I needed to be there. Rides was another issue altogether, but as luck would have it, Kyle Ishimaru from Sacto provided(thanks to his friend Chris), and we were zx~x <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
