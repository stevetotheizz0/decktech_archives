Let me explain...<br>
<br>
     Tatooine Utility Belt is a card that nobody really uses. I admit, wouldn&#146;t a decent character be better in your deck than a device that adds 2 to power and forfeit? And yet I like the Belt. My first experience with the Belt was when I got my 2 Premiere Starter Decks. The Belt was fun... it allowed Luke to be power 4, forfeit 6. How cool was that? And then I started buying packs... once I got Nightfall I made my first decent deck. The Belt now enabled Talzes to be power 7, forfeit 6 (with the Belt, Nightfall, and Tooex). Or I could put it on Beru Lars, make her power decent (3) and with Owen she became forfeit 7, a nice candidate for a Noble Sacrifice. But eventually I discovered that there were better cards than the Belt, so the Belt seldom saw any more use. But then one day I went to a 3rd Anthology Sealed Deck Tournament. My LS deck had a Belt in it, and the Belt proved to be quite valuable indeed. Whether it was making a character Bubo-proof, adding to my activation at the Tosche Station, being drawn for destiny, being stacked with ASP-707, adding to battle damage, or whatever, it was always appreciated. In that tournament I discovered that this Belt might well have 100 or more uses. And if a card such as the Belt can have that many uses, who knows how many uses some other cards have? This article isn&#146;t completely humorous, it&#146;s at least half-serious, it gives you a whole new appreciation for those shoebox cards, and it might take you back to your days when a Stormtrooper Utility Belt meant Vader actually got to be power 6. And yes, this article does have a point. More on that later. The list:<br>
<br>
1. Making opponent lose more Force from a battle because of the added power. 2. Making yourself lose less Force from a battle because of the added forfeit.<br>
3. More retrieval with Noble Sacrifice.<br>
4. Holding a site with a lone character is easier.<br>
5. Sell it to the opponent with Treva Horme.<br>
6. Stack it with ASP-707.<br>
7. Track it for a battle destiny.<br>
8. Track it for a weapon destiny.<br>
9. Track it for a Jedi Test destiny.<br>
10. Track it for a Sabacc destiny, especially with a 7 (4+7 =11, perfect sabacc).<br>
11. Track it for asteroid destiny.<br>
12. Use it to make a character Bubo-proof.<br>
13. Use it to enhance Tosche Station activation.<br>
14. Use it to bypass a Lasergate.<br>
15. Retrieve it with Baragwin.<br>
16. Exchange one card in hand for it in Lost Pile with Baragwin.<br>
17. Track it for a duel destiny.<br>
18. Deploy it for free with Corellian. Even more useful with number 19...<br>
19. Use Jabba&#146;s Palace Sabacc to get an Advosze. Then when you deploy the TUB to Advosze&#146;s site, you get to activate a Force!<br>
20. Deploy on a Ghoel to give it some actual power (and making it forfeit 6).<br>
21. With Ishi Tib put it on bottom of Used Pile so you can get something different.<br>
22. Track it so you can get it back with Ishi Tib.<br>
23. Number 21, but with Mirax Terrik.<br>
24. Number 22, but with Mirax Terrik.<br>
25. Let opponent steal it with Trooper Sabacc.<br>
26. After it&#146;s stolen, steal it back with Kabe.<br>
27. After it&#146;s stolen, steal it back with Trooper Sabacc.<br>
28. After it&#146;s stolen, make opponent lose it from hand with Leesub Sirln.<br>
29. After it&#146;s stolen, steal it back with Uutkik.<br>
30. Add to a character&#146;s forfeit to better prepare him for Bacta Tank.<br>
31. Add to a character&#146;s forfeit to better prepare him for Heroic Sacrifice.<br>
32. Take it into hand with Yoxgit.<br>
33. Track it for 8D8 destiny. 4 &gt; 3.<br>
34. Deploy it for free with ASP-707 (see number 19).<br>
35. Deploy it as a &#146;react&#146; with CZ-3.<br>
36. With careful calculation, use it in conjunction with a tracked EG-4 to keep your power a little less than the opponent&#146;s, but then doubled even more. For instance, if your power without the TUB is 6, and their power is 9, and you draw EG-4, your power is 12, they only lose 3. However, after the TUB is deployed, your power is 8, then when EG-4 is drawn your power is 16, they lose 7!<br>
37. Use FX-7 to stall, so you&#146;ll either get a timed win or at least lose by less, possibly by only a timed loss. How? Deploy the TUB on a character, let the opponent &#146;hit&#146; the character, then when the character goes to Used Pile (with FX-7&#146;s text) argue that the TUB goes to Used Pile too. Spend a few minutes arguing, then they&#146;ll get the TD. After a couple more minutes, the TD should prove you wrong, however, you just burned a nice chunk of time.<br>
38. Track it to draw with R2-D2&#146;s gametext.<br>
39. Track it for Attack Run destiny.<br>
40. Track it for Deactivate The Shield Generator destiny.<br>
41. Track it for Yarkora destiny.<br>
42. Track it for Dice Ibegon destiny.<br>
43. Deploy it from Reserve Deck with Corporal Beezer.<br>
44. Use Corporal Delevar with number 37, thus enabling you to forfeit the character to Used Pile without them needing to be &#146;hit&#146;.<br>
45. Track it for Sorry About The Mess.<br>
46. Track it for That Thing&#146;s Operational!.<br>
47. Track it under a destiny 0... draw the 0. The opponent laughs... then use Han&#146;s Dice, now drawing the TUB destiny 4 for destiny instead. The opponent stops laughing, doesn&#146;t he?<br>
48. Track it for Lost In The Wilderness.<br>
49. Track it for a Cantina Brawl.<br>
50. Track it for Master Luke.<br>
51. Track it for Maneuver Check.<br>
52. Track it for a Concussion Grenade.<br>
53. Track it for an Infantry Mine.<br>
54. Track it for a Vehicle Mine.<br>
55. Track it for a Timer Mine.<br>
56. Track it for an Orbital Mine.<br>
57. Store it under a Cyborg Construct. Make opponent extremely curious as to what this card is that&#146;s so precious it must be stored under a Cyborg Construct.<br>
58. Actually deploy it from the Cyborg Construct, watch opponent&#146;s face.<br>
59. Read Cyborg Construct&#146;s text closely. Especially the part that says &quot;Place stored cards in Used Pile if device lost or removed from character.&quot; This may enhance the whole Corporal Delevar FX-7 argument (see number 44).<br>
60. Deploy an Echo Trooper Backpack on a trooper, then deploy some obscene amount of TUBs onto the trooper... remember, the trooper can use each one. The opponent may argue that the cumulative rule would apply so only one would count, and the opponent would be right, so let&#146;s hope that doesn&#146;t happen. Anyway, after deploying all those TUBs, battle and use Jedi Presence. Watch opponent&#146;s face when you inform him that your trooper is like power 136.<br>
61. Use Electrobinoculars to rig a TUB for a destiny.<br>
62. Take one into hand with Portable Scanner.<br>
63. Track it for a search party destiny draw.<br>
64. Use Traffic Control to track it, for whatever purpose you need.<br>
65. Steal it from yourself with a Retractable Arm.<br>
66. Track it for Retractable Arm. 4 &gt; 2.<br>
67. Track it for a couple Targeting Computer destiny draws.<br>
68. Track it for Move Along...<br>
69. Track it for Nabrun Leids. Hey, it&#146;s better than a 5, 6, or 7...<br>
70. Track one... or two... or three or four for Death Star Plans.<br>
71. Put it in the Crash Site Memorial to save it for later exchange into hand.<br>
72. Track it for Sense.<br>
73. Track it for Alter.<br>
74. Track it for Eject! Eject!<br>
75. Track it for Flash Of Insight.<br>
76. Track it or a few of them for Surprise Assault.<br>
77. Track it for Figrin D&#146;an.<br>
78. Track it for Barquin D&#146;an.<br>
79. Track it for Vedain. Who? Vedain.<br>
80. Track it for Transmission Terminated. 4 &gt; 3.<br>
81. Track it for Tauntaun Bones.<br>
82. Track it for Spaceport Speeders.<br>
83. Are you getting tired of &quot;track it for X&quot;? How about something completely different... like using it as toilet paper.<br>
84. Use it for target practice.<br>
85. Use it as firewood. Call it a Cardboard Compound Fire Maintenance Card.<br>
86. Use it for origami. If you actually do, be sure to send me a picture.<br>
87. Have your opponent play with 59 Belts and a starting site (Cloud City: Docking Bay). You start with the Clout City: Prison, first turn pull Lando and deploy him there. The rest of your deck is Trooper Sabaccs and a Reactor Terminal. After stealing 58 Belts (they have 1 Life Force left), move Lando to the docking bay. Use Reactor Terminal, putting your whole hand back. Drain. You win by 115. A pair of people actually did this at some major tourney, like a regional or something. Due to the super-high differential, I think the kid ended up getting second. Due to that, we now have Victory Points, 2 for a win, 1 for a timed win, 0 for a loss. That way you can&#146;t win just by differential.<br>
88. Back to tracking... track it for a Disarming Creature destiny.<br>
89. Track it for Cell 2187.<br>
90. Track it for Starship Levitation.<br>
91. Track it for Anakin Skywalker.<br>
92. Track it for Collision!<br>
93. Track it for Double Agent.<br>
94. Track it for Egregious Pilot Error.<br>
95. Track it for Friendly Fire.<br>
96. Track it for a Sabacc.<br>
97. Track it for Impressive, Most Impressive.<br>
98. Track it for Ewok And Roll.<br>
99. Track it for Ewok Log Jam.<br>
100. Track it for Ewok Rescue.<br>
<br>
     Wow. Okay, I&#146;m sorry for like half of them being tracking, but still... I could&#146;ve named a lot more. And there IS a point to this article! <br>
<br>
     The point is that every card has its uses.<br>
     <br>
     Even Send A Detachment Down. I recommend sewing several together to make a nifty toilet seat cover.<br>
<br>
     And I hope you never say &quot;That card&#146;s useless!&quot; ever again. Because if I hear you say that, I just might have to recite a hundred uses... or two hundred... or... whatever.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
