You need to know how people cheat, how to recognize it, and what to do about it.  Don&#146;t get cheated at a tournament because you can help it.<br>
I will start off with a list of some of the ways I have heard that people cheat.<br>
<br>
1. Activation.  <br>
	This is perhaps the most common method of cheating, activating more force than you should.  Players know that activation is key to winning the game and even getting one more force can be pivotal.  Maybe the cheater won&#146;t do it the first turn or the second so sometime mid game, when they hold in their hand Vader and Tarkin and the only activate nine force, they may try.  <br>
	The key to recognizing this is to always watch your opponent activate.  Don&#146;t be afraid to ask him how much he activated and to make him recount.  It takes about two seconds to recount anyway.  Keep track of how much force he saves.  You should do this anyway to anticipate barriers, the Spiral, and reacts.  Cheating like this can be simple to catch.  If you can&#146;t tell, you may have to count the force yourself.  If you find someone has over-activated it doesn&#146;t necessarily mean he was cheating.  Just make him retake the force and watch him.  If it happens over and over, then its time to call over the Tourney Director.<br>
<br>
2. Cutting Costs.<br>
	This is paying less force than you should.  Instead of paying fifteen for that Executor, fourteen looks a lot better.  This method of cheating can be hard to spot depending on how your opponent spends his force.  If he does it slowly than you can watch how much he pays but people don&#146;t pay for things in the same way.  Some people pay in chunks and some people do it so fast you don&#146;t even have time to say &quot;Hey!&quot;	Also, if they deploy cards, take the action back, then redeploy elsewhere, make sure in all the switch-er-oo they paid for what they deployed.<br>
	The key to recognizing this cheating is to watch your opponent when he pays for his cards.  Make your opponent pay in a way that you can tell how much force he is spending.  If he pays his force too fast for you then tell him to pay slower.  If he pays in chunks tell him to do it one at a time.  Don&#146;t be afraid to tell someone to pay for their force in a way that makes it easier for you to watch them.  If you can&#146;t make him do it to your speed then you have to count it yourself.  If you find someone has under-paid it doesn&#146;t necessarily mean he was cheating.  Just make him pay the force and watch him.  If it happens over and over, then its time to call over the Tourney Director.<br>
<br>
3. Stacking Your Deck<br>
	This involves shuffling or placing the cards you need into the right place in your reserve deck.  This can take a lot of forms.  Pre-game the opponent could place all the cards he wants, every Vader, in the bottom of his deck, trusting to an opponents cut to send them to the top.  Or evenly spacing the cards he wants every so many cards so that at least one is in the opening hand.  In-game it could be shuffling and watching to see where the cards go while you are shuffling.  You could normally shuffle your deck sideways and peak at your cards without the opponent knowing.  I once saw someone ask &quot;how many cards in your reserve&quot; and then take a card from his hand and put it onto the top of his reserve.  Also I have heard of distracting the opponent to look at the top of the reserve.  <br>
	The key to recognizing this type of cheating is to see how he shuffles his deck.  If he shuffles the top of his reserve into the top of his reserve than the bottom isn&#146;t getting shuffled.  If he shuffles in a way that lets him peak at his cards then he is looking at what cards go where.  You can always ask him to shuffle a different way.  I prefer the putting out three or four piles and putting a single card in each face down.  I believe this really shuffles your deck and you can make the opponent do it too.  Also you can cut your opponents deck into about four or five stacks and then replace them.  I like to vary how I cut an opponent&#146;s reserve deck so that sometimes I cut in the middle and sometimes the top or bottom.  Vary how you cut your opponents deck.  One thing you should always do is, cut your opponent&#146;s deck.  That should be good enough.  <br>
In the case of distracting in order to stack the reserve, you need to keep that in mind when someone asks you to count your piles.  They may be just distracting you.<br>
<br>
4. Deck Scouting.<br>
	This involves trying to find out what your opponents are playing before you play them.  This can take two forms.  Looking around during games to see what your neighbors are playing or discussing with friends in-between games what kind of decks they just faced.  I have seen this type of cheating done many many times and it is the most common.  The problem with this type of cheating is that most people don&#146;t think it is cheating.  It is.  <br>
	The problem with recognizing and fixing this problem is that it happens outside of the games.  The tourney director can&#146;t do much about it and the player whose deck is being discussed isn&#146;t even around to defend himself.  If you overhear someone discussing someone else&#146;s decks during a tournament you can do three things.  The first is nothing.  This is the easiest thing to do and the coward&#146;s way out.  Second, you can tell the tourney director that it is happening.   Third, you can tell the other person to stop it.  <br>
A simple way to get deck scouting mentioned is to tell the TD.  Usually at the beginning of tournaments when the tourney director asks if there are questions I raise my hand to ask about deck scouting.  You should too.<br>
<br>
5. Force Loss.<br>
	This involves losing too few cards to force loss.  A force drain of twelve can be really bad.  So in order to remove some of the brunt of that loss the cheater will lose eleven or ten.  They may make an action like they are losing all twelve or the just may intentionally miscount.  They could put the same card into their lost pile multiple times counting on you to just be looking for the action.  This happens on force drains and battle damage and most of all during automatic force loss.<br>
	The key to recognizing this is to look at your opponent&#146;s lost pile as he puts cards into it.  Watch that the appropriate number goes into the lost pile.  You should already be watching the lost pile to see what cards go in there to get a clue as to what the opponent might still have in his reserve, what strategies he has, and what he isn&#146;t going to able to do. (Especially if you play with Out-Of-Commision) Just take this action one step forward and you are also watching for this type of cheating.  In regards to automatic force loss, it is the responsibility of the person who plays the card to be aware of their own cards.  Make sure to tell your opponent about anything that makes him lose force and watch him lose it.<br>
If you find someone has under-paid it doesn&#146;t necessarily mean he was cheating.  Just make him lose the force and watch him.  If it happens over and over, then its time to call over the Tourney Director.<br>
<br>
6. Too Many/Too Few Cards<br>
	This involves playing a deck that does not have a total of 60 cards in it.  Generally this type of thing is not cheating.  Most of the time when a deck is less than 60 it is because your last opponent has kept some of your cards.  Once, I heard of an opponent intentionally keeping his opponents cards in the hope that he would not recognize that he was playing with less than 60.   <br>
	The key to recognizing this type of cheating is to count your opponent&#146;s deck.  If you&#146;re counting his deck than he should have nothing better to do than to count your deck.  If he says &quot;I trust you.&quot; then tell him &quot;Don&#146;t go trusting me too far.&quot;  I heard that in a movie once.  If you find too few or too many cards your opponent is not really cheating.  Generally, it is just a mistake.  You also do the card count for another very important reason.  Number 7 will cover that reason.<br>
<br>
7.  Marked Cards.<br>
	This involves making cards distinguishable from other cards in order to know what they are.  I saved this one till last because it can be difficult to detect and to stop.  The range of possibilities with marked cards is so extensive that I can&#146;t and won&#146;t even try to list them all here.  <br>
	The key to recognizing marked cards is to look at your opponent&#146;s deck when you are doing your initial card count.   Place all the symbols so they face the same way.  Look for blotches and marks on the top of the cards.  Look for anything that stands out on the sleeves.  Look for things that just look odd.  You don&#146;t have to spend forever at this but just give a quick glance to each card.  At the first Gen-Con I remember looking at a guy&#146;s card with a mark on it and I made him replace the sleeve to fix it.  Don&#146;t be afraid to mention that a card looks odd.  If you find something odd you can call over the TD and have him look at it.  Maybe he will look at what card it is and determine if it should be switched.  Let me tell you a secret, sometimes I can look at my own cards and recognize little defects in them and use them to track.  That is cheating and you have to look at your opponent&#146;s deck to see that they aren&#146;t doing it.<br>
<br>
The reason I wrote this article is because I recently caught someone cheating in a game.  It was a little kid but I watch little kids as much as I watch anyone. This is the situation...It was the first turn in the game and the little kid was playing with Jabba&#146;s Palace and he used the game text to pull a Jabba&#146;s Palace site. First he sat his hand down next to his force pile. Then, he looked through and held the reserve close to where he sat his hand. He slipped a card out of his reserve into his hand and continued to look through his deck. He then pulled out a Jabba&#146;s Palace site. I asked him what card he had taken out but pointed to the Jabba&#146;s Palace site. I then picked up his hand pile and counted 9 cards.  I then turned over the card he had taken from his hand and it was Scum and Villiany. I then asked him what he was doing and he admitted he was cheating. I think he only admitted it because he was a little kid.  <br>
<br>
I sent this to the Decipher List-serve and I got this response from Juz:<br>
&quot;<br>
Well, if nothing else, this little kid cheating at a little local tourney <br>
story should show you that cheating is not purely driven by big <br>
tournaments and money prizes (where the cost of being caught is so much <br>
higher). It is more dependent on the type of person than the environment.<br>
<br>
What have I seen? All sorts of funk - From people who activate and use <br>
force in lumps rather than one at a time, to players who badger, belittle <br>
and intimidate opponents during a game and during a tournament. Players <br>
who talk about the deck they just played between games to friends, and <br>
players who place recycle their hand instead of their Used Pile into <br>
their Reserve Deck in end game. Players who email friends before events <br>
to work out what other players are playing so they can meta, and players <br>
who do not remind their opponent that they he forgot to draw asteroid <br>
destiny...<br>
<br>
Cheating? Accident? Style? Competitive spirit? Honest mistakes? Who <br>
knows... <br>
<br>
Welcome to gaming. :)<br>
Cheers,<br>
Juz<br>
&quot;<br>
I also got this reply from Chuck &quot;Devestator&quot; Kallenbach:<br>
&quot;<br>
 Don&#146;t forget putting lost cards in their used piles, creative shuffling <br>
(including lack of shuffling), dropping cards on the floor, and lots more <br>
stuff. People used to get shot for this in the Old American West (they <br>
were also shot for taking cards from their Reserve Decks, but I digress).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it&#146;s clearly the player&#146;s responsibility to determine if <br>
his or her opponent is cheating. The TD cannot watch 6 or 8 or 10 games <br>
at once to determine if the players are playing fairly. And if the TD is <br>
watching your game carefully, he&#146;s ignoring other games where cheating <br>
can run rampant (this is called distracting the referee in the WWF).<br>
<br>
Chuck<br>
&quot;<br>
I hope they don&#146;t mind my putting their emails into this article to try to show that cheating is serious.  It happens.  When it does you can&#146;t be afraid to confront it either.  If someone is cheating don&#146;t just sit there.  Call over the TD.  Even if the TD doesn&#146;t do anything at that time, he will keep his eye on the cheater.  <br>
<br>
While having said all of this, you can&#146;t play the game feeling like it is populated by a bunch of cheaters.  Give your opponent the benefit of the doubt.  There is a difference between an honest mistake and an intentional one.  Forgive the honest mistakes and you can assume that most of the time your opponent is making an honest mistake.  But have a healthy fear of the intentional mistakes.  <br>
<br>
The one piece of advice that flows through all the above is to watch what your opponent does, especially during his turn.<br>
