Much like the old Samurai whom had to learn the makings of their weapons to better understand it's nature, so did the Jedi construct their own weapons and so should you make your own decks. The process helps sharpen skills and forces a person to THINK about the game.<br>
This article assumes basic knowledge and an amount of playing experience on the part of the reader. In order to best learn how to build decks, one must play (sometimes a lot) to learn the basic game mechanics. Take those opportunities to see what other people include in their decks and why those decks do (or do not) work.<br>
I know that I'm not always very specific. If I wanted to be specific I'ld put another deck up for reveiw and explain the purose of each card and sub-strategy. The purpose of this article is heighten the awareness of the concepts involved in building a deck.<br>
<br>
Part 1. Theme<br>
The goal of the game is to reduce your opponents life force to 0. I define Theme as the manner in which a deck is designed to acheive this goal. The general means of accomplishing this is..<br>
a) Force Drains. Force Drains happen when you control a location that has one or more force icons for your opponent. This simulates the military occupation of a strategic location. There are several strategies that focus upon building up drain bonuses and draining your opponent out quickely. To drain, however, one must control the site, which leads to ...<br>
b) Battle. Simply put, to overpower your opponent. Decks that focus on Battle often include smaller 'side strageties' to make it more effective. Weapons and other cards can allow you to exclude or force the forfeiture of specific characters and vehicles (starships included) These add depth to the game and often are capable of tipping the balance.<br>
Most decks included both aspects of Themes 'a' &amp; 'b'. The third and most ecclectic catagory is....<br>
c) Other. This is the hardest catagory to define. It is here I place Numbers/Odds, Turbo-Sanctuary, Suprise/Counter Assaults, Epic Events, Dueling, Visage of the Emperor and others. I would not put Force Choke or manipulation here because they do not deal damage by themselves. They deny your opponent the cards necessary to effectively compete against a Theme.<br>
Theme is important. You needn't have more than a rough idea of what your theme is as you begin to construct a deck.... you can refine the concept as you go. However, you need to refer back to it at times in order to keep your focus.<br>
<br>
Part 2. Enviroment.<br>
Envirement encompasses the 'gameboard' built by deployed locations, effects (and any other cards) that alter game conditions, AND countermeasures. The idea is to create an envirement that hinders you're opponent while providing you with an edge(i.e. Scum &amp; villiany provides deploy bonuses and force retrival, or an Obective. LS may play heavy SAC so DS plays There is No Try, There'll be Hell to Pay, Opressive Enforcement, SAC..).<br>
I often consider Locations first. You need to insure that you will generate enough force for deploying with enough leftover to draw or pay for interrupts and other cards. 'Force Choke' could be an asset if you plan to go heavy on Theme 'b' and take the fight to your opponent. Force Drain bonuses can be useful for Theme 'a' and luring your opponent to where you have an advantage. Objectives &amp; Epic Events, if chosen, will dictate some of your selections.<br>
Next I look at Vehicles(includes starships). Sometime they become necessary by the locations you choose(Tatooine:Desert, Endor: Great Forest, Systems &amp; Sectors). Someare desirable for their attributes, bonuses, unique properties(Sandcrawlers with Jawas, Dreadnaughts with TIEs, Immunities, 'react', permanent pilots with ability 2), or high power/forfeit (AT-ATs &amp; Star Destroyer).<br>
Then, I pull characters. Many of the same concerns apply here as with vehicles. Look for peope who gain bonuses at your chosen locations, with the selected vehicles, and with other characters (i.e. any Vader with Grand Moff Tarkin).<br>
Characters, Vehicles &amp; Locations are the muscles, ligaments &amp; bones of your deck &amp; Theme. You should be able to justify the purpose of each one, even if it's just that you need the extra force, power, or forfeit.<br>
Weapons are almost strictly for theme 'b' (b for Battle).<br>
Devices are rarely used in some areas, but do not discount them entirely. Comlink and Wrist Comlink allow characters to react. Restraining Bolt prevents droids from moving and using game text (maybe useful to stall A Gift, Death Star Plans, ASP droids or R2 &amp; 3PO). If you haven't looked at what devices you own in a while it's time to go back through them and reveiw.<br>
Effects, and then Interrupts, make up the last part of a deck. These often enhance or further define the Theme. They are also your best chance of covering up the weak points. Look for vulnerability to Sense/Alter. Compare the destinies to what you plan on drawing against (weapons, Sabacc, Sense/Alter vs your characters ability, more..).<br>
This is also where you build Theme 'c'.... damage dealt by a method other than Force Drains or Battle. As a side strategy, you may notice that the average destiny in your LS deck is high. A couple Suprise Assaults may be useful. Tn the same situation, you may waish to go a little light on S/A or work in higher ability characters.<br>
In the case of a Theme 'c' based deck, you would probably consider Effects and Interrupts second.. after location, but before vehicles and characters. These types of strategies often place very specific restrictions on what you can choose. Turbo Santuary, for example, is easily 1/3 to 1/2 locations, 5-6 Asteroid Sanctuaries, with a handfull of ships to establish the Sanctuaries and protect them. Numbers/Odds limits Characters.<br>
<br>
Part 3. Counter Measures.<br>
Although I consider Countermeasures to be an aspect of Envirement, they deserve a section of their own and should be adressed seperately.<br>
Countermeasures are usually a function of the local Metagame. Metagame refers to what is being played by the majority of people in your area. Your deck is usually constructed to circumvent/confront the popular deck types or to emulate them, thereby hoping to duplicate their success. Without actual playing experience, Local Meta is difficult to prepare for.<br>
In some part, you may have adressed countermeasures while selecting Effects and Interrupts to cover the weak spots in your deck. This is, essentially, their function.. but magic bullets exist, as well as cards which are capable of countering a wide variety of strategies. Sense, Alter, Control, Grimtassh/Monnok, and What Are You Trying To Push On Us/There'll Be Hell To Pay are aggressive counters that attack your enemies supporting cards, thus weakening their strategies. They have a place in nearly any deck and are recommended when more specific cards prove risky to play or hard to obtain.<br>
<br>
There is more out there than I can cover in a 'broad strokes' article like this one. The only way to truly learn and prepare a good deck is to get out there and play what you have. Keep your eyes open.. ask questions... remember what works and what doesn't.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=816"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=816"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=816" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
