When you think of AT-ST Raltiir Operations, the first guy you think of is Martin Akesson.  And when you think of Lightsaber Combat, you have to give credit to Martin Akesson.  That is because Martin has been one of the most influential deckbuilders of Star Wars ever since the very first set, Premiere.<br>
<br>
If you&#146;ve watched Martin&#146;s decks closely, you will notice that plays just a few characters and starships and lot of high-destiny interrupts.  You will also see twixes, Tunnel Visions, and Sense and Alter.  I had the chance to ask Martin about his playstyle, and also what it takes to place second at Freedomcon.<br>
<br>
JT: I think it&#146;s safe to say that your playing style is very different from the other 3 finishers.  Your light deck in particular plays a new objective with just a few characters and starships and a lot of interrupts.  Why do you think this style of deck is so successful?<br>
MA: It&#146;s all about card efficiency and EPPs.  My character base usually seems low, but 2-3 Resilience plus 2-3 of EPP Obi and EPP Luke makes quite a lot of characters total.  And with high destiny, each EPP takes care of 2-3 characters, even early when you can&#146;t track your destinies.  The few characters match any other deck in ground power.<br>
<br>
JT: Lightside Lightsaber Combat decks are generally weak to a speed drain deck such as Dark Deal.  What strategies did you use against this deck type?<br>
MA: It was a meta choice, and a good one, since the only deck like that I faced was Bastian&#146;s in the final.  Light seemed quite weak, so I figured Hunt Down, Senate or dark side Lightsaber Combat would be big, and this deck matches perfectly against those decks.  Speed decks are heavier to handle, but I get my drains going real quick.  They can&#146;t drain where they have a Jedi, which leaves their sites where they can drain open to beatdowns.  Also, my deck has few cards on the table, which gives me more cards to lose to his drains!<br>
<br>
JT: You faced off against Hayes Hunter in the semi-finals, and it looked like the matchup was pretty good in your favor.  What was going through your mind as you were playing that game?<br>
MA: No much, really.  At that time I had been playing for like 14 hours, so you can&#146;t really focus on anything else but the game.  If I would have lost I still would have been happy with the Gamecube.  About the matchup: my light deck had already beaten Hunt Down twice, so it was an easy choice.  My dark does good against WYS too, but I didn&#146;t test that matchup as much as I had with my light vs. Hunt Down.  Also, I never considered Hunt Down to be as strong as many say it is.<br>
<br>
JT: It seems that you rely on tracking a lot in your deck.  How long did it take you to learn how to track reliably, and how many cards can you track at one time?<br>
MA: Tracking . . . well, it&#146;s not very hard.  If you use a few recyclables and Threepio with parts, everyone should be able to track one or two cards at a time.  I also try to keep my destiny up as much as possible, so I don&#146;t have to track all the time.  Especially powerful early in the game when tracking is pointless.  I have a &quot;rule&quot; that I try to stick to as long as possible, and that is to never lose a high destiny from your hand if you are able to put it back.  Rather lose blindly from the top.  Destiny is so powerful late in the game.  How long it took and when I learned . . . don&#146;t know . . . it comes with the game and is a part of the game.  I believe I could keep track of 10 cards or so if there are few left, but I never do and never need to.<br>
<br>
JT: This is sort of an off-base question, but it looks like you have started putting Artoo-Detoo in Red 5 in all of your decks lately.  Considering your small character base, how many times have you actually used this card in space?<br>
MA: It&#146;s the ultimate destiny 7 since you can sense with it and you can use it.  I never deployed it in tournament games I think, but I have in playtesting . . . but mainly it&#146;s there for the destiny.<br>
<br>
JT: &quot;All Your Base Are Belong To Europe&quot; is rapidly becoming one of the most-copied decks around, and the original idea was yours: you and Bastian used virtually the same deck, and the only loss it had was to Bastian&#146;s QMC in the finals.  What were your thoughts when you were putting that deck together?<br>
MA: I had the idea a long time ago, at Death Star 2 when the Admiral&#146;s Order came out.  I built a deck at that time, but it was too weak at that time.  When the third Tatooine docking bay came out I started to think about the deck again, and I put it together.  I modified it with the Coruscant expansion cards and playtested it against Bastian over the net.  I lost to his Podprofit.  When I got to Freedomcon, it was the only deck I had built together, so I added the Reflections 3 cards and tested it.  It worked surprisingly well.  I showed it to Bastian again, and we decided to use it.<br>
<br>
JT: As long as we&#146;re talking about your deckbuilding, you&#146;re considered one of the major designers of several decktypes, including the original Podprofit and AT-ST RalOps.  How does the deck-building process work for you?<br>
MA: I didn&#146;t play very much at all those days . . . actually, I only play before and in major events.  To still keep myself updated about what&#146;s going on, I spend time on decktech and thinking about decks.  I create decks almost daily in my head.  I build a few of them, and a few of those work.  Most of my decks are originally designed to beat a certain type of deck, and then I modify it to become more all-round.  RalOps was originally with four Evaders to counter Throne Room Revo, Podprofit was against Brangus.  Another deck I would like to give myself credit for is the JP manipulator used a long time ago, before Special Edition, which was a modified version of the manip deck I used before JP, which original idea came from a German guy using A Dangerous Time in his Worlds deck during Dagobah days.  That deck was the best deck ever made.<br>
<br>
JT: All a person has to do to see your accomplishments is go to your decktech member page.  There are several championships listed there, and now you can add Second At Freedomcon to the list.  What advice would you give to people on how they can be a successful player?<br>
MA: You cannot become good if you are not interested in the game.  Being interested leads to spending time on the game, which leads to success.<br>
