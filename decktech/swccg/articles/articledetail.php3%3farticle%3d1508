This is my first exposure to the CCG world (I didn't know CCG was an acronym at the time), but Star Wars isn't released yet (or at least it's not at my gaming store)<br>
<br>
Fall 1995- Some of my fellow Star Wars Adicts buy some cards, but I don't have money to buy both Magic and Star Wars.	They try and teach me how to play, but they really didn't read the rulebook carefully themselves.  The game really sucks when you think you can't deploy to a location the opponent controls w/out a spy (of which they had none).  This is premeire, so they get bored cause of lack of variety.<br>
<br>
Later on, A New Hope is released.  They are still stuck playing random cards, so I don't see how the game is very Star Wars related.  Magic is interesting and I am able to build a decent tournament deck (for those magic fans, I survived the Black Summer or 1996).  Cause we don't know the rules still, whenever I play Star Wars (with my friends' cards), I never find it possible to initiate a battle (except all of those meaningless battles where each player loses one of their 8 characters.<br>
<br>
When Hoth is released, I see the Star Wars parallel.  I am a high level tournament player (tournament magic is often monotonus), and i want a change of pace, so I read the rulebook and pointed out some huge mistakes in the way my friends were playing (they also thought you had to pay 1 force to force drain) I decide to split a box of BB premiere with my friends!  I pull goodies like DS-61-3, Revolution, and Devastator while my friend gets a han Solo.	I thought my half sucked but I still play with some of the cards I opened in my first box.  He craved my han's back and my Solo han.  At the time, about 5 of us play regularly.  Star Destroyers, Walkers, and pilots with ability of 2/3 are coveted by everyone.  Fortunately, noone got a Ben/Vader so noone really dominated.  One dude was able to trade most of his good stuff for a Veers to go with his Blizzard 1.  Almost all of use decide to build only one side of the force (I had no Light deck until at least 2 years after I started playing)<br>
<br>
Dagobah and Cloud City happen, and everyone can actually afford stuff now.  One my friends pulls the trigger and pays cash for a BB Vader and BB Obi-Wan.  We laugh at him when we crush his deck that had more Back cards then mains(we still thought retrieve meant into your hand on the back cards).  We start developing strategies.  A lando/AFA/Gambler's luck deck appears.  A Test 1 deck appears (noone had test 2 for a while).  I raked coals with my Dark Deal/ Bounty hunting deck.  We have a prisoner and Bounty with my CC Fett were cool.<br>
<br>
JP changes everything in our play circle.  Some new friends have decent collections and play serious Star Wars.   We find out about the internet and tournaments.  We pool all of our cards together and we build some decks.  I was the only one that wanted to play, so I was able to muster 1 of every LS main (even 2 Lukes and anakin's stick), I played a CC drain deck with 3 Pucimir Thyrss (together, we had about 8).  For the DS, I was gonna go with the DD/Capture deck (All Wrapped Up was amazing), but at the last minute, I was able to get 6 Walker Garrisons and a Blizzard 2, so I played that.  I went 3-1 (I played a complete scrub twice for some reasons,  let's just say he played Jedi Pack Vader and he let me play 3 Walker Garrisons for a drain of 34).  I got some decent prize support and finally decide to build a competitive LS deck (instead of the Jawa crap I was playing).  I completly quit tournament magic and play only for weird fun decks with friends.<br>
<br>
Special Edition is also a big change.  I buy half a box (my ritual for every set, DSII will be about 3 boxes cause I have a good job now) and get the most amazing cards ever.	I get RTP, BiHT, Goo Nee Tay, and Vader, DLOTS!  In 15 packs!  I now have 2 solid decks, a RTP deck and a Space numbers deck,  I go to some tournaments and do well, getting 3-1 or 4-2 very consistently, nothing to write home about but never below .500  I play the DS deck very well against everyone in the city (Toledo isnt' exactly Nashville for Star Wars talent), but my RTP deck loses alot I do a little main swapping (we did this alot, trade my Executor for your Ben kenobi) and I'm able to play Tatooine celebration.  I develop a love for Sorry About the Mess and There'll be hell to Pay (but not the counterparts).  Advice: fall in love with a card and play it in everyone of your decks.  It brings a smile to your face whenever you can play it.  Right now, my favorite card is You Are Beaten.  Once, I got lucky once and won a tourney(all because of massive differential with DS).  We pay attention to the tournament scene and just play for fun when any broken decks are out there (anything errataed now).  We always swap mains and power cards to keep things from getting repetive.  i gain a competitive edge because I understand gaming concept (like activation, threats, etc) from my experience from Magic.<br>
<br>
Endor and Beyond.  Some of My friends lose interest in the game and quit (advice: don't play SWCCG unless you plan to become a serious tournament player, competition keeps the game fun.  If you do play for fun, memorize the Trilogy cause watching Star Wars is a must when playing Star Wars).  Everyone still playing splits their collection.  We enter the world where everyone has double of every main and can build more than 1 deck for each side.  Props to Decipher for EPP's.	While they got lots of negative feedback, it expanded the tournament scene.  I was (and still am) a quality player with a limited budget.  I still don't have any Mara jades or a 3A cause I can't always afford stuff.  AGain, Decipher helps us.  Every 4-5 months, we're able to spend $40-50 and split a box of anything that comes out and stay competitive.  I re-enter competitive magic after all the broken turn 3 kill decks are not legal.  For those of you that don't know, Every year, 3 sets are printed in magic, called a block.  The 2 most recent blocks, as well as the basic set (old cards that are reprinted that WotC wanted to keep legal).  Basically, magic got too predictable and I gave up spending lots of money(usually $150-200, which i didn't have) every 3 months to be competitive.<br>
<br>
Star Wars on the other hand, is easy to maintain competitiveness.  Everytime you buy cards, you know you can always use those cards forever, not just for two years.  If I wanted too, I could've kept my old DD/bounty deck and just adapted it as the sets progressed.  Every set after CC has contributed someting that would help the deck remain competitive.  That's the beauty of SWCCG: you can keep old decks forever and adapt them as the game progresses.  Very few deck types become obsolete, and you can win with just about anything.  I've been playing the same Faulke style Hidden Base ever since endor came out.  I've made my own modifications to it (advice: never play a NetDeck) and it's still a pile of crap, but I still win with it.  I know how to play it and it has advantages that I can't do without (almost all of those are gone with DSII, maybe time for a change? nah).  There is only a metagame if you choose to be part of it.  Sure, certain magic bullets are important and certain cards hurt certain objectives, but you are only part of the metagame if you choose to be.  Wanna play ROps?  Sure go ahead but expect everyone to know how to play against your deck.  DSII brings so many options to the table.  The Admiral's Orders can easily have a deck based around them.  Anything can compete in Star Wars.  That's why I will always play Star Wars.  I love playing a game of Star Wars with a person I've never met before playing a deck that I've never seen before.  DSII solves the problem of abusing cards.  Every abusable/broken card can be wrecked by another card.  You have to play legitimate, non-cheezy decks.  I'll go to every tourney I can in the DSII era and I encourage all of you to do the same.  Even if you lose, you'll play a good game of the best CCG out there. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=1508"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=1508"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=1508" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
