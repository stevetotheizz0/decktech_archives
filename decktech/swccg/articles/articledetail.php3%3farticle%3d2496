<br>
These days I see lots of players of want to become better player. I see lots of kids and people round me who wants to break out of new bee tradition and scrubs idea. This article is meant for those people. Article will give you some idea how to improve your playing field and some very basic Meta format. This is my life experience from stars wars and people I interacted with week basis. I hope you like my article. I try to keep the taps off. If you see some I am sorry and ignore it. Please give it a good review. <br>
<br>
<br>
My first time I ever play this game, I was a truly a new bee.  Basic Endor decks with no mains and no objectives. My deck was built on how the cards look and not what they did. One red card for the starting (signal) and that was it. I was luck enough to buy lots of cards in weekly basis because of my income but not everyone could do this. Only problem with this buying spree was, there was only one set of cards was available at the store. It was an endor packs for $1.99 and that&amp;#8217;s it.  Also, I was new to the area so I did not know if there was another card shop.  <br>
<br>
My first tournament I ever went to was in Palmdale. It was the same shop I buy my packs, so that was nice. Michael @#$%man, who was the tournament director at the time and also my first mentor in this game.  I showed up 1 hour before the tournament to ask him some questions. He was very nice and pleased. (Still is and plays) He took my deck and went through it. Then ask me the most important question of my Star Wars history. &amp;#8220;Do u know what this do and when to use it,&amp;#8221; obvious I said no. Then he went through my deck and explain how to use them and when. I think it was the most important think he could do before he gave me his extras.  He asks me to name all the phases of the game. Of course, I had a blank look, so he went to his bag and gave me a book of the rules. He turned it over and said &amp;#8220;This are the phases of the game. It must be followed to the letter. &amp;#8220; I gave him a nudge. Before the tournament started he takes me aside and said &amp;#8220;IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING DONT BE AFRAID TO ASK.&amp;#8221; That made me settle down. I played all four games and won 2 and lost 2. I could not believe I won 2. Was this a joke or what. Won 2 wow. Wins came against two 7 years old kids who was playing for weeks it was still a win&amp;#8230; After the tournament, Mike took me aside and asks me some basic questions. How did you like game? Do you know when are next tournaments is?  Do you know how to check for your ratings? And extra. Told me how to improve my decks and what to expect in the tournament play. <br>
So in my first tournament ever some took interest in me and made me understand the game. WOW. I think this is what is missing in some players today.  They do not take their time try to introduce the game to new players. Make them understand how the game works. They rather tell them what to put in there decks and never tell them how to play it or how important is Gk. is to a never player and etc. There was an article here few months ago that was about mentors. It was a good article so refer to that too please.<br>
These days I see lots of players who have great decks and great combos that just cant win. They have 3 mauls and Mara or obis with great combos and still cant win. Well, major reason is their attitudes. They get down on them selves before they even start. They walk over to the table and make a remark like &amp;#8220;Lets see how much am I going to lose by or go easy on me.&amp;#8221; I believe this is bad for the atmosphere of the game. No confidences, their are for any bold moves to finish the game. Everyone loses, and anyone could walk away with a victory if they decided to put minds to it. Always start with a fresh look at your opponent. You never know what mistakes your opponents can make or even have a good deck today. They might be playing echo base and your playing SYCFA and you decided not to blow up the Hoth because you forgot you can. You got nervous because you never beat this player yet. He has 50% foils in the deck and he has been playing for 4 years. &amp;#8220;I say so what.&amp;#8221; It is your game to lose. There no one else is going to beat him for you. Put your fear away and do what you need to do. Take your time before doing an action. Think twice before doing something. I am not saying you should stall or take your sweet time and hope to stall him out. That is wrong and has no honor. Think about all the cards in your deck. What can you expect from your opponent? Do you remember his favorite trick or move. Maybe he prefers setting up fades menace or cantina shuffle, spy to stop a force drain. When you start remembering this you will improve your game by 200% and command respect for playing style.  (you could still be an ahole but at least you will be a better player)<br>
The differences between a fabulous players and an average players is fabulous player never forgets what his opponents options are. They never forget what his opponents favorite cards are and how to use them. Do they retrieve in mid game or at the end? Do they play like a turtle at first and at the end move like flash? Do they draw at first hand or do they force drain. Do they never play their objectives? (Hidden mains) Remembering this, it will improve your game. You should able to remember your opponents options. Those you opponent prefer to fight in space and dodge you at the ground or vice versa. This is Meta. Just shear studying you opponents moves and tricks. Its the most important part of the game I believe. If you know what going to happen you can be prepare. Have that Gk., or barrier, imperial command, hyper escape ready when needed. Also if your opponents plays these play some counters to that to surprise them. Playing your game and controlling it with what to expect is how you win. Not going in with guns are blazing and hope that you hit someone. <br>
Second, most important things a person must do improve it self is to take your time. Do not forget force drain and direct damage and never ever skip a phase. Never ever &amp;#8220;ever&amp;#8221; skip a phase. If forgot to activate could cost you the game. Not to drain could cost you the game. If you lose by 11 or 12 and you forgot to drain for round or two could be result in a lost. Take time between turns and reflect on anything with you forgot. Maybe that alien went down for more than what it should be. You forgot to activate for kuat and wauelken for extra force. Maybe you miss calculated your power and damage to opponent. Also major mistake I have seen people do is, they jump from activation to deploy and to battle. Never remember to force drain. You finally notice that little tie fighter or bounty ship sitting by it self and you decided to jump on him.  You got all happy, crazy and giggle that you seeing it. You just activate and went to deploy and battle. You forgot to drain of 2 somewhere and also you forgot first strike (which makes you gain one and opponent lose one) and battle him and won by 7 direct damage. Yippy. You have killed that poor ship for 7 damage. But forgot to make him lose 3 for force drain and first strike. You notice know that you could of hitting him for 10 damage. (7+2+1) It is a major mistake. You never know what your opponent could lose and what you can gain. Maybe a retrieve engine he lost or another ship or a major character. This is a game about inches. Little by little you have to try to dwindle your opponent down. It does not seem like a lot but end of the game you will notice that ever forces counts. Paying attention to detail is part of the game. Its the major part of the game. Search and destroy or visage or walkers could be the difference in the game. Putting pressure on the opponent could make them on the edge and cause a major mistake in their judgement. Ask any good player and you will get the same result, paying attention to detail will win games. Making your opponents pay for 3 a drain could keep you from a major beat down. Draining them proper can hurt any player. Drain of 2 is different from a drain of 4. Thats 2 extra cards you do not have to worry about. Yes Paying attention to detail works and try it. <br>
Last and major thing a mediocre player must do next is, keep up with the trends. Every card becomes great at one point and dies out. After a while it comes back. Here is an example. If your area just went back to alter and senses put some defenses. If they are using blast the controls for imperial barrier stoppage be careful and do not trust your cards. Suddenly numbers are coming back keep an eye out for it. Maybe someone is playing druids numbers and asteroids. Time to add in come here you big coward. Or my favorite, if someone playing honor of a Jedi play an you play no escape. Keep the deck alive. Your deck will make you proud as long as you keep it going. No one takes you a side and tells you that they are playing numbers today or surprise assaults. Yes, I know you can not protect yourself from everything out there but you can take nice precautions to keep it going. Keeping up with the times what makes this game more exciting. (At least to me) Maybe in your area, no one remembers operatives or railteir opts. So, surprise them. Maybe good old hidden base will kill them because no one plays security precautions any more. Little differences will keep your opponents from learn what you have and how to defeat you. Maybe he so your echo base 20 times maybe this time, run numbers or use speeders and then look at their face. They never knew what hit them. Spending little time in your deck and cards will improve your game. Take 20 minutes extra on Sunday or something like that and look at what you have in the deck. Remember what people played last time and maybe put a counter, add another ship or a lightsaber to boast the drain. <br>
This article is to improve people and make them accountable for their decks. We can all improve by competition. I would rather play someone who is my caliber than some people who just learn two minutes ago by word of mouth. If we can raise the level in our local tournaments we can became elite people in the state.  We need to take time to show young and new people how to play and when to play it. Better they get, better is your computation gets which in turns makes you a better player. Do not just give a new player a deck and say good luck. Take some time and teach him/her the fanatics of the game. This in turn could make you better. Maybe you forgot a card that will help next time. Maybe get the rust your current Meta. This is for the rest of the players, pay attention to your and opponents cards. Everything does something. There is no useless card. Just less important cards but still useful. Pay attention to detail. Keep up with current ideas and Meta. Always keep your options open. Never let something go by, just because it might look like a hassle.  Do not forget your opponent is not god its just a person who pays attention to detail. <br>
I hope you like my article. I try to keep the taps off. If you see some I am sorry and ignore it. Please give it a good review. <br>
