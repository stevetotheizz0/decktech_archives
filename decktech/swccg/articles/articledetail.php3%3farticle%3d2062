Doesn&#146;t take me long to come up with the following combo, which while not broken, ain&#146;t half bad. Check it out. Oh and if you&#146;re one of those people that doesn&#146;t want to see cards before they&#146;re released (do such people even exist?) I suggest you leave now.<br>
<br>
In a nutshell, it&#146;s the new Artoo &amp; Threepio card (R2/3PO) in the Outrider with LE-B02D9 (Leebo) piloting. A little help from the interrupt Artoo I Have a Bad Feeling About This (Bad Feeling) from Jabba&#146;s Palace and this combo becomes a beast. At least for a goofy fighter flown by three droids.<br>
<br>
If you know your cards you can see where I&#146;m going with this and probably have thought of it yourself, but if you haven&#146;t here&#146;s a quick explanation.<br>
<br>
First the cards:<br>
<br>
*Artoo &amp; Threepio<br>
Threepio&#146;s extensive experience &#146;talking&#146; to the Falcon&#146;s computer allowed him to pilot the freighter while on Coruscant. Artoo, an R-unit droid, provided moral support.<br>
Character - Droid<br>
Destiny 3; Deploy 3, Forfeit 6; Power 2; Pilot/Astromech<br>
May pilot only Falcon. All droids may be battled. Any player that has no ability in a battle takes no battle damage. Once per turn may take one card with &quot;bad feeling&quot; in title into hand from reserve deck; reshuffle. Bad Feeling Have I is suspended.<br>
<br>
*LE-B02D9 (Leebo)<br>
Lore Unknown<br>
Character-Droid<br>
Destiny 3; Deploy 2, Forfeit 4; Power 2, Armor 4; Pilot<br>
May be battled. While aboard any freighter adds 2 to hyperspeed and may draw one battle destiny if not able to otherwise. If you have completed Rycar&amp;#8217;s Run or Kessel Run, opponent loses 1 force (2 if both) during each of your control phases.<br>
<br>
*Outrider<br>
Highly modified Corellian Engineering Corporation YT-2400. KonGar KGDefender military grade ion engines. Griffyn/Y2TG hyperdrive. Never boarded by Imperial customs.<br>
Starfighter<br>
Destiny 2; Deploy 2, Forfeit 5; Power 3, Maneuver 4, Hyperspeed 5; Independent/Astromech/Scomp Link<br>
May add 2 pilots and 1 passenger. Utinni Effects which retrieve Force are immune to Alter, but are placed out of play when completed. While Dash or Leebo piloting, immune to attrition &lt;4.<br>
<br>
I don&#146;t have the text to Bad Feeling handy but basically it&#146;s a destiny 3 lost interrupt that has multiple functions. One of them (the important one) says that when Artoo and Threepio are in battle together the opponent draws no battle destiny. Slick. If I use gametext from any other unreleased card in this article that you are unaware of, simply check the spoilers at www.decktech.net, main page.<br>
<br>
So here&#146;s what goes on: you put Leebo as a pilot on the Outrider and R2/3PO in the backseat. You leave them alone at a system, making sure you have no other ability there. You use R2/3PO&#146;s text to pull a copy of Bad Feeling. When the Executor or Steve in Slave drop down to pick a fight, you take no battle damage (as per R2/3PO&#146;s text), and your opponent draws no battle destiny (Bad Feeling) so you take no attrition either. Your power is a sorry 3, BUT you get to draw destiny and (maybe) take some guys out with attrition.<br>
<br>
Basically you&#146;ve got a ship that&#146;s like Palpatine at the Death Star Docking Bay 327 in a SYCFA deck - no battle damage, no attrition. So the only way to take this ship out is to shoot it with a TIE Cannon or such.<br>
<br>
What are the drawbacks? Admittedly, there are many...<br>
<br>
1. No ability. It&#146;s good in battles as you can use R2/3PO&#146;s text to your advantage. But it does not allow you to force drain, block opponent&#146;s drains, or initiate battle. Nor can you draw battle destiny against Zuckuss in Mist Hunter. Nor do you &quot;occupy&quot; the system so you may not fulfill Battle Plan/Order or deploy an Admiral&#146;s Order with these guys alone.<br>
<br>
2. Bring Him Before Me wins battles against it. Against a BHBM deck you&#146;ll want to try to keep the droids out of the line of fire, as a lowly power 3 plus destiny doesn&#146;t quite cut it against the big bad Ex, or even the Chimaera or a Dreadnaught with some pilots. No battle damage does not mean you don&#146;t still lose the fight. Hyper Escape anyone?<br>
<br>
3. First Strike/Scum will still work for the opponent. They can still initiate the battle, and do their &quot;I retrieve three you lose one&quot; schtick.<br>
<br>
Surely you can think of quite a few others. At first glance, this combo might not look so hot. Can the advantages outweigh the drawbacks?<br>
<br>
First, let&#146;s figure out how to get these cards in play. A three-effect start with Squadron Assignments in the mix is essential. After that, a few Signals and a copy of Echo Base Garrison (pulls maintenance droids, which I&#146;ve heard Leebo is) and Seeking an Audience (pulls R2/3PO) should get it done soon enough. Playing multiples of the droids is an option, as is the interrupt Artoo, Come Back At Once. Garrison and Seeking have minor secondary uses which may come in handy later on as well (for instance, Garrison can get the Bantha droid to protect against Lateral Damage, and Seeking&#146;s text concerning Luke can hurt big-time against a MKOS deck).<br>
<br>
Now, a few reasons why the combo is good. Assume here that the light side is playing with the new objective, Watch Your Step (WYS).<br>
<br>
1. First and foremost, the Droid Threesome virtually allows the light side player to perform unlimited Kessel Runs. WYS allows the light side player to pull Kessel and Corellia system, and with Leebo at the helm, the Outrider can make it between those two systems easily. No dark side starship in the game can. The gametext on the Outrider will keep the dark side from Altering the Kessel Run and the text on WYS will keep them from cancelling it through control of the Kessel system. The ONLY way the dark side can cancel the Kessel Run is with Oota Goota, Solo?<br>
<br>
The Outrider places the Kessel Run out of play when completed, but that does not mean you can&#146;t play multiples. With 5 Kessel Runs in the deck, you can retrieve 35 force each game and your opponent is helpless to stop you. Only traditional counters such as Secret Plans and Come Here You Big Coward might hinder you. And if you really want to, you can put the droids on the Falcon instead - as long as WYS is flipped your Kessel Run can&#146;t be Altered, and then it won&#146;t be placed out of play either, so you can bring your Runs back and play them forever. Just bear in mind that you won&#146;t be drawing battle destiny (so you won&#146;t be doing any damage) in battles.<br>
<br>
2. Once you do finish a Kessel Run, &quot;Legendary Leebo&quot; kicks in, causing one force damage a turn. The opponent is helpless to stop this as well. Leebo can&#146;t force drain, but he can fire off some direct damage.<br>
<br>
3. The Threesome has some serious beatdown potential. The opponent may decide to get smart and leave your little droids alone with Zuckuss in Mist Hunter or the Executor and a pilot or some such. Or he may be involuntarily placed in such a position by the Corellia/Kessel parsec spread. In any case, a quick Dash Rendar on the Outrider and a Cap&#146;n Han/Falcon trick (you started Squad Assignments remember?) along with Wedge or some schmoe to put you over 6 ability (if Zuckuss is there) and you get the BEATDOWN. Dash is a virtual 9-power swing (adds 3 to power of Outrider, subtracts 6 from any opponent&#146;s ship present) and Han can add a battle destiny. You still get to use your Bad Feeling so the opponent draws none. That&#146;s a hurting. Then when it&#146;s all over slide Dash over to the Falcon and send the Droid Threesome on about their business.<br>
<br>
4. In combination with This Place Can Be A Little Rough, the deck gets double its lifespan as your Bad Feelings can be played right out of the lost pile. This not only helps the Threesome to survive more battles, it allows you to cut down on the number of Bad Feelings in your deck, and to almost always have one when you need it. Just remember that with retrieval going on it&#146;s better to keep cards in play.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That&#146;s just a start. There are many directions you can go with this combo, from making it a side strategy that only takes up 10 or so card slots to basing half your deck around it (hmm, 10 Kessel Runs = 70 force retrieved each game...). You will undoubtedly want some ground crew (Jedi Luke with Courage of a Skywalker and Yoda Stew/You Do Have Your Moments sounds like fun - and don&#146;t forget to play them again from lost =) so that you won&#146;t have any problems with Search and Destroy, CHYBC, etc.; and so you can cause some damage (Leebo&#146;s good, but one force a turn isn&#146;t gonna win the game for you).<br>
And don&#146;t forget to laugh at your opponent as your Droid Threesome flies through an onslaught of 8 TIE Interceptors unscathed ;-) </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=2062"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=2062"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=2062" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
