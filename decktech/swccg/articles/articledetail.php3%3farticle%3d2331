Also the rant is gone and some of the other things that did not need to be said.  I am sorry about having the rant in the first edition because I should of just made it an article or something and not named any names.  I do hope that I have created the best possible version of this article so that everyone can easily learn some stuff from it.  Oh, it might take two sittings or something because its quite longer than the first (7 pages in Word instead of a short 5) but the new information was worth it and I did not think I could write a completely different article that was good containing just that information.  So, from the guy who wrote an article that got such varied reviews as &quot;A breath of fresh air in comparison to the last eight months or so of decktech articles&quot; and &quot;your a incestuous little tick who&amp;#8217;s so full of @#$% that if he got an enema his clothes wouldn&amp;#8217;t fit&quot; to you all, the newbies and experts alike, here is my &quot;The Relationship Between Chess and SWCCG (expanded, edited, and complete)&quot;<br>
<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
Since I am pretty much unknown to the SWCCG community I would like to give you all some information on who I am. My name is Jonathan Murray and I played SWCCG up from when Premiere came out until early last year.  During my play experience there were few regular tournaments near my house.  Those that I did get to play in were early in my carrier so I did not have good showings at most of them. I did get pretty good anyway and ended up creating a broken deck that could consistently win on turn 4 or 5 about a month before I quit the game.  Now I am thinking about coming back since there are regular tourneys near where I live.  Anyway since I have not been playing SWCCG I have been playing, reading books on, and studying chess.  I decided to check out Decktech a few weeks ago and after looking around on it I decided to write this article on what I have learned about SWCCG through playing chess.  I think some of what I have learned has not been talked about much in other SWCCG articles that I have read and the rest of it are things that are harder to learn that have been talked about some.  I hope that this article presents those things that people already know of in a different way so that they may be easier to learn for some people and I also believe that there is something in this article for the newbie and the expert (though there might not be too much for the expert!).  I mainly talk about playing in tournament games, the preparation for those tournaments, and general playing strategies.  I will start with the preparation.<br>
<br>
The first and most important thing in your preparation is to learn the elements of the game.  What I call the elements are basically the simple game mechanics such as battling, force draining, the rules (including all errata), sequence of actions (who plays what when), and such things as force generation and efficiency.  I would consider efficiency the most important element in SWCCG.  I believe that if you have a deep understanding of these elements you will win many more games and be able to create better decks no matter what cards you have.  In chess they have many books on the elements and for SWCCG you can look at many articles on here.  In chess when you are learning these basics it is suggested that you study the endgame first because you learn the power of each individual piece and that is helpful during the middle game, which you study next.  The middle game then helps the opening.  I have not ever read anything on this, but I believe that by playing SWCCG endgames your understanding of the overall game increases just as in chess.  Why?  Well, first of all my definition of a SWCCG endgame is when the game has only a few more turns to play and/or both players have around 10 or less life force.  Now it is important to study this endgame because you find out the worth of each individual card and how they can be used to their fullest potential.  Also, both players are forced to play as efficiently as possible or else it is almost assured they will loose.  Anyone who has been playing for a while can remember a games where it came down to the wire and both sides could have won but one eventually did because in the endgame they played their cards more efficiently than the loser did.  Take for example the recent 2nd game of the final duel in the Texas State Championship; it had come down to the wire and someone (forgot the name sorry) had the game won but forgot to battle and had to loose force to Order to Engage. They did not win that game by enough to win the tournament.  Why not?  It is simple-they did not play as efficiently as needed in the endgame.  So we see that by studying SWCCGs endgame a player becomes more efficient in playing.  That efficiency can be easily taken and used during the beginning and the middle game along with the endgame so that your play is better all around.  I will talk more about efficiency later.<br>
<br>
Now, onto when you are preparing for a specific tournament.  In chess it is important to know who your opposition is and it is the same for SWCCG. This information is normally provided to the players of big chess tournaments and unfortunately that is not the case for SWCCG but most people know who the good players are in their area anyway.  The reason you want to know your opponents in chess and swccg is so you can know what they play and learn to play against it.  There are chess databases that have all the tournament games of chess players from the late 1800s to today, so, if I was preparing to beat certain people in chess I could look for their recent games and see what openings they like to play and what there play style is.  In SWCCG it is not quite the same because there is no game database, but there are tournament reports.  I suggest when preparing to beat certain players that you know will be hard to beat and would be at the tournament look for tournament reports written by them (decktech is great for this) and read through them.  Write down any notes you want to on that player such as what decks they like to play, their play-style if you can tell, and any reoccurring flaws they have.  <br>
<br>
I do not suggest studying how to beat certain players very much though.  It is much better to study how to beat popular deck types such as the deck types the tournament winners like to play, so it is actually useful to read those reports by the experts and see what they play.  In chess when a grandmaster is preparing for a match or tournament, the majority of the preparation goes into the chess openings.  Now most people would not realize it at first thought but, just as chess has different openings, so does SWCCG.  Those openings are basically what deck types you and your opponents are playing.  In chess there are many different guides and books on how to play different openings and all the variations of those openings.  There is no such thing for SWCCG but there is a solution to that problem.  I can promise you the people who write those chess books know much more about what is in the books than most anyone who buy them.  So, the solution is to write your own SWCCG &quot;opening guide&quot; which would contain information on how each good deck type beats other good deck types.  I suggest for anyone who is preparing for a tournament to get a spiral notebook or something and use it for that purpose.  Start of your opening guide with the decks you are testing and write down their weaknesses and strengths.  Then go into how each of those decks will beat the other deck types (which is learned by play testing of course) and what cards help do that.  Write it all down too so then you can refer back to it.  Eventually you will have a very good and complete SWCCG guide that will be very helpful to you and other local players you want to share it with such as your team if you are in one.  Just to reinforce this, think about how many times people go to play test against a deck they have already play tested against before but they have to spend a good amount of time learning how to beat it again.  The guide you create would help reduce the amount of time you have to spend play testing later on.  <br>
<br>
There is also a physical aspect to preparation.  I think most SWCCG players ignore this and suffer dearly because of it.  I will not spend much time on this because it is basic but it does need to be reinforced because of its importance.  First of all, do not get burnt out play testing a lot the week before a tourney.  I would recommend not playing the night before and in the morning before the tournament.  Instead, take a jog or something before you leave.  It will relax you and hopefully clear your mind.  Get enough sleep the night before (obvious thing to do but how many people do not do this? Many people) and have a good breakfast if you have time.  Lastly, do not go to a tournament with a hangover or something worse (except the brownie; I heard it could produce some really bad side effects :).  That is all I am going to talk about when it comes to preparation for a tournament.  Do not think that is all that is necessary though.  Play testing is probably the most important thing so if you do not know how to do that go read an article on Decktech about it.  Now, onto the actual tournaments&amp;#8230;<br>
<br>
Right before the tournament I would scope out the competition.  Is there anyone there that you prepared to play against?  Who did you not expect to show up that did and could be a major contender for 1st place?  Take some time before the tourney to note all these things and go over your preparations for specific decks and people accordingly.  Also, I would do something to get your brain working.  Many grandmaster chess players go through a few relatively easy chess problems just to do this.  Anything like that would work.  Once you find out your first pairing go ahead and consider some things about your opponent.  Is your opponent a good player or not?  If you have no idea how good he is you can ask him some friendly questions such as &quot;How long have you been playing SWCCG?&quot; or something like that.  If you do not think he is good go ahead and start thinking about how many force you want to beat him by.  Once your opponent shows his objective and starting effects remind yourself how you will play against that deck type.  The next thing is to use your time wisely.  In chess tournaments there are time controls just as in SWCCG so good chess players will not spend much time making the easy decisions but I do know of times when players have spent twenty minutes or so on one move.  Now that would be a bit excessive in SWCCG, but still, it is good to remember to not spend much time on the easy plays just the hard ones.  If you are known as a slow player and you time out a lot of games it would be wise for you to take note of that.<br>
<br>
Okay, now onto some general playing techniques.  This is important when preparing too but I wanted to put it here because during the tournament is when it all counts.  This part is probably the meat of this article and I have never read anything even close to it before but it is extremely important.  In chess the most important part of the board is the center of it.  If you control those squares, you will be controlling the game the majority of the time.  Chess masters often sacrifice material just to control the center because it is so important.  Now, SWCCG is not played on a square board and the middle of the playing space is not always important but the principal still remains that if you control the important locations you control the game.  It is not too hard to evaluate what the &quot;center&quot; of a SWCCG game is.  Normally it would be the sites that are strategically important to you and your opponent.  In a Ralltiir Operations deck the center would normally be the Ralltiir sites themselves because they are important to the dark side strategy or the center could be the Audience Chamber in a Scum and Villainy deck, which we will use for examples later in the article.  The center can also be a high force drain location or anything else that causes a lot of trouble for your opponent.  A high force drain location would not be as important as the Audience Chamber in a Scum and Villainy deck because the force drain is normally temporary while the AC is useful even when the dark side is not force draining there.  So we can say that the high force drain location is a temporary center while the AC is a strategically important center.  Now, taking note of that elementary fact of what the center is, we can begin to think on it some more.  Would it be okay, as it is frequently in chess, to make a few sacrifices to take control of the center?  Yes, of course it would because if you control the center you normally control the game and there will be many chances to regain your losses once you have control.  For example, if you were playing a light side Endor deck against a good scum deck it would be safe to assume that the audience chamber could be considered the &quot;center&quot; of the swccg game.  For the light side to win against a good scum deck it is reasonable to assume that they would have to take over the Audience Chamber.  Since they could not do that at the same time as taking over Endor, we figure that to take the AC it must devote all its resources there unless there are other ways in the deck but for now we will say there is not.  First of all, if there is no way for the LS to take over the AC we can assume the light player did not prepare to face a good scum deck and it is not the fault of the strategy of taking over the center but instead in the way the deck was prepared.  So if the LS has sufficiently prepared their &quot;openings&quot; there will be a decent chance of taking the AC and it would be worth sacrificing Endor (not taking it over) for it.  The DS would not take over Endor when the LS did not because they depend on their center, the Audience Chamber.  So, the light side should do what they can to take the Audience Chamber over.  After the dust of the fight clears, it is safe to assume that whoever has control of the Audience Chamber has control of the game.  It is also noted though that the light side will have a harder time taking the Audience Chamber because it is still useful for the dark side even during the fighting because of Scum and Villainy. The light side should still try to take it over instead of having the dark side come to Endor though.  If the dark side came to Endor, the light side would be busy defending its valuable locations that do not give any outstanding bonuses to the rebels.  So already they would have a harder time defending there than the dark side would defending Tatooine and, on top of that, the dark side would probably also have its bonuses from the audience chamber working for them.  In that circumstance I believe the light side would be overwhelmed compared to if they had been the one doing the attacking by going to the Audience Chamber.  So we see three things from this example: the majority of the battling in most games should be at the most strategic location on the board, whoever is helped by that location could easily have the upper hand whether there is or is not battling at the center, and the eventual winner of that location has gained control of the game.  <br>
<br>
I am not done talking about the center yet though.  In chess there is something called overprotection.  It is basically the systematic overprotecting of the center and by overprotecting a center that you have control of it will stay in your control during a game of chess.  The same is true in SWCCG- the strategic center must be overprotected.  Note:  a good force drain location or any other &quot;lesser&quot; or temporary center does not need to be overprotected as much as a site such as the audience chamber in the example above.  We will use that location as an example again.  If I am dark and I have got a few good characters (lets say Jabba, Pote, and a skrilling or two) at the AC and my opponent is draining me for a total of two or three at a few Endor sites should I deploy people to stop those drains?  If I did that I could probably stop the some of the drains but there would be several side effects to it.  I would have committed myself to another planet so I would eventually have to reinforce my people there and then also the light side would have an easier time attacking me in the Audience Chamber. Instead, if I had deployed characters to the AC to overprotect it the drains would continue for a while but the center would be overprotected and it would be secured.  Note the sacrifice-DS chooses not to stop the immediate force loss but instead to reinforce the center.  I could safely start to invade Endor after I did that.  Okay, so to reinforce that let us say that the LS Endor player is starting a game against the DS Scum player.  The dark side decides on his normal opening strategy of getting scum out which is a good choice of a strategy while the light side decides to take over Endor and go for some force draining.  The light sides strategy is (as discussed above) not sufficient enough to take control of the game.  So, since the dark side player is pretty decent, he sees this mistake and after quickly getting scum out and working he deploys to Endor to take the offensive, consequently making a mistake of his own.  That mistake being that he did not overprotect his center.  The light player does not like what his opponent is doing though and decides to strike back so he attacks the Audience Chamber because he realizes that his opponents Scum and Villainy will get the best of him if he does not.  The light player has unknowingly corrected his mistake and now the battle for the Audience Chamber, and with it the control of the game, will ensue.  The light player will also have a better chance to take the chamber because his opponent has wasted people on Endor and left some important characters in the Audience Chamber without proper defense.  So we see that overprotection is necessary to control the flow of the game.  Basically, you should fill the holes your barrel before you ride it down the river.  Furthermore, the pieces in chess that are used for the overprotecting are worth more and better off being protectors of that important area on the board because they are so valuable.  Again, there is another relationship between SWCCG and chess; that the protectors of the center are more efficient because of the job they are doing.  So, we see that by overprotecting our good locations our decks become more efficient because each of the cards used in the overprotection are more efficient in and of themselves.<br>
<br>
One of the hardest things for me and many other people in chess is considering what my opponent can do and not just what I can do.  Although I do think it is harder to do in chess, in SWCCG that needs to happen a lot.  Lets say I was playing one decent deck and my opponent was playing a deck style that easily counters my deck.  Would it not be better for me to forego what I would normally do to fight against his deck by trying to stop it from working?  Then later on after accomplishing that I could set up my deck with less fear of the natural counters his deck has. Why is this that I would have an easier time setting up after attacking his deck strategy?  Because it is inevitable that he would loose some of the cards that would of countered my deck, whether it happens through loosing cards off of the reserve or him seeing me play completely differently and thinking he does not need certain cards to beat me.  So, it is important to stay flexible and be open to changing your whole strategy if the position calls for it, and that is all the better if your deck is flexible enough to switch back to the original plan later on.  Now, going back to the center.  In chess, if you control the center you can normally switch your plan pretty easily and continue onto a different and better one that you will win with.  There is another good reason why controlling the center is an important thing in SWCCG; it is easier to switch strategies and playing fields (the different planets, or from sites to systems) if you control those important sites.  So all in all controlling the center of the game board is one of the most important things to do and makes your deck more versatile and, and along with that, more efficient.  There is one last note that needs to be made about the center and that is how many strategic centers should a deck play.  I believe that there should only be one in each deck or none at all.  To have more than one would mean that you would have to overprotect two locations and spend more time and force doing that which would make your deck slower.  But then would it not be better to play none at all you ask?  In many cases that may be true but some decks inevitably have them and then in others very good bonuses can come from having one.  In those two cases the bonuses will easily offset the downsides to having a center and having to overprotect one of them.  Actually, the only downside I see is that you would have to play a few more people to the location or include some tactical interrupts into the deck to help with the protection.<br>
<br>
All this talk about centers and how to play with them is just part of a larger picture though.  That picture is that there are a large amount of strategies to choose from and they all can have their faults.  Whether you are playing with or without a deck that has a center and you are playing against a deck that has or does not have a center you must evaluate the different strategies being used.  What are their bonuses and flaws?  How can you take advantage of your opponents flaws and get rid of or conceal your own?  Can you do both of those things at once?  All this must be taken into consideration but if you expect to be able to analyze the position entirely when you are playing in the tournament you are probably wrong.  When you are preparing for the tournament this kind of thinking is crucial.  <br>
<br>
I am almost done.  After the tournament is all over go back and see how your preparations helped you.  Write down what helped, what did not, how you can improve your preparations, and what you need to prepare for next time. Hopefully you will have a better understanding of how to prepare that next time.  That is about it.<br>
<br>
Okay, I have got some recommended further reading for everyone who has not read these articles yet.  If you learned something from my article I promise you will learn just as much if not more from these:<br>
<br>
1.	the four efficiency articles by Ryan Fojtik.  These are overall my favorite articles on here and have helped me immensely in the past.<br>
2.	 &quot;Tracking Simplified&quot; I do not know who this is by but it is a good article on tracking that will increase the overall level of your play if you do not know how to track.<br>
3.	&quot;Deck Building Turner Style&quot; by Steven Turner.  This article is the best on making a good deck with a detailed list of steps to take in order to create and fine tune your deck and is much better than any of the recent ones I have read.<br>
4.	&quot;My Generation&quot; This article is about force generation and talks about the fact that the better supplied army wins.  A real good article on a subject everyone needs to know about.<br>
5.	&quot;Finding, Using, and Beating Tech&quot; by Jackal (?).  One of the better articles about tech on here.  If you do not know what tech is or would like more info on what the title says you should read it.<br>
6.	And, just because broken strategies are great fun, &quot;The Search for the Elusive NPE.&quot; by Preston Hunt and Jon Miskulin.  In the first edition of this article I had the name wrong (sorry about that).<br>
<br>
Okay anyway, that is it.  Wow, this article is seven pages long in Word I hope you all enjoyed it!  If you got some questions Dmail me or Dmail me if you want to talk about chess strategy and the such.  I will be sure to check my mail some during the next few weeks.  I hope that there is something in this article for everyone from the newbie to the world champ.  May The Force Be With You!<br>
