Since I have played light side combat extensively in the past, I figured I would write an article about how to beat combat that has a little more substance than &quot;combat is gay.&quot;  I realize that a lot of experienced players already know some great ways to beat combat, but this may help those that are still struggling to find a way to deal with it.<br>
<br>
First, we need to examine the strengths of combat.  Obviously, the biggest problem when playing against combat is their big drains.  They start with two locations that they can immediately drain for two at, and there&#146;s really not much you can do about it.  In addition to starting with two drain-two locations, they also give themselves five icons in addition to the one they generate themselves.  This is excellent early-game generation and, assuming a deployment modifier like Goo Nee Tay isn&#146;t out, allows the player to deploy their dueling powerhouses first turn - Qui-Gon Jinn, Jedi Master and Lord Maul.  As I&#146;m sure you have all figured out, this means that if your opponent has a decent opening draw you will be losing two cards on their second turn of the game.  A great way for the light side to take this advantage away is by playing It Could Be Worse.  Just make sure you have a way to cancel It&#146;s Worse, just in case.  Menace Fades and Imperial Decree are also good for reducing saber-enhanced drains.  More on how to take away this advantage later.<br>
<br>
Another major benefit the objective gives a combat player is that it essentially nullifies the opponent&#146;s Jedi.  I think this is probably the part of the deck that most people have a problem with because it so drastically revolutionized the way people play.  Hunt Down, Bring Him Before Me and Hidden Mains are just a few of the deck types that took serious hits and now it takes a skilled player to win with these decks against a solid combat deck.  The only way to stop the big drains every turn is to put a Jedi at one of their Naboo sites, and a good combat player will make sure they can avoid your battle and then duel your Jedi off their site, making you take damage either way.  In addition to hindering many popular deck types, it is my opinion that this also takes away some of the fun of the game; most people used to love playing their mains and toys, since mains are what the Star Wars movies are based around.  Basically lightsaber combat completely changed the meta in every area and made people play new decks.<br>
<br>
So combat does a lot of damage early, makes life tough for a lot of mains decks, and can duel your characters with the greatest of ease by using a lot of battle avoidance cards.  To a lot of people, this hardly seems fair.  This raises the question, how do you beat a deck that has such strong advantages?<br>
<br>
The first thing you can do is play different decks - no longer can you rely on straight mains to win your games for you.  Luckily there are several very viable deck types that can handle combat and still be competitive against other decks as well.  <br>
<br>
A good match up for both light and dark side is a general space deck.  Light side obviously has Hidden Base and EBO, which can provide big drains that take advantage of combat&#146;s general lack of space.  Dark side has similar space platforms that work just as well such as Set Your Course.  My personal favorite choice for a dark side space platform is Senate TIEs.  Senate TIEs takes advantage of all of light side combat&#146;s disadvantages.  First of all, it deals a lot of damage quickly.  TIEs are cheap, and with Lott Dodd helping you get your systems out and Tikkes boosting your activation, you can set up drains in a hurry.  TIE cannons eliminate the most common space fleet that light side combat packs (Han, Chewie &amp; The Falcon) and Motion Supported allows you to drain for quite a bit.  Since light side combat is by nature unbalanced, they will rarely be able to hold down Menace Fades to stop your drain bonuses or satisfy Battle Order, and if they can then TIEs have a lot of support cards to take their space out.  Senate TIEs also has a lot of retrieval with Sienar Fleet Systems, Short Range Fighters and Squabbling Delegates.  Finally, you can also hold down Imperial Decree with relative ease, canceling those drain bonuses from Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon&#146;s lightsabers.  In short, Senate TIEs is a very favorable match up against combat because it takes advantage of combat&#146;s imbalance.<br>
<br>
Outside of Senate TIEs, one of the best anti-combat designs I have seen is the All Your Base deck that won worlds.  This, and Walker Garrison as well, combine two things that most combat decks aren&#146;t designed to handle - plenty of direct damage and enclosed vehicles.  The direct damage is an obvious advantage; combat does about four points of damage a turn, assuming no saber bonuses.  All your deck has to do is create more direct damage than that while putting few cards on the table and you will have the advantage.  The reason enclosed vehicles are so great for holding down an Occupation or enhanced drains is that the mainstay fighting force of combat decks are EPPs.  EPPs are disadvantaged against multiple reacting vehicles because they can&#146;t reduce forfeit, and with a high-destiny deck or a tracking player, Tramples can take out EPPs before the battle even finishes.<br>
<br>
Another great match up against light side combat is an alien swarm such as My Kind Of Scum or Court Of The Vile Gangster.  These decks are advantaged because they use no Dark Jedi, thus being able to ignore one of combat&#146;s bigger advantages.  The real advantage to these decks lies in the form of Mosep and Gailid.  These guys get big drains off the top of the combat player&#146;s reserve deck, which can make up for the fact that alien swarms have to put more cards on the table.  Alien swarms can get big drains going, and with the help of deployment modifiers like Scum And Villainy, aliens can create a sufficient beat down on the combat player without fear of being dueled.  Sure they will &quot;death finger&quot; one of your characters, but with the retrieval of Scum (which goes through even if they cancel the battle with an evasion card) it is a small price to pay to block a drain for a turn and possibly make them lose a drain location for a while.  I think MKOS is a better match up because of the +2 to battle destinies and the speed in setting up, but the direct damage Court provides can also be a good advantage.<br>
<br>
This leads up to one of the best and most obvious ways to beat combat - play decks that don&#146;t rely on Jedi.  This takes away a big advantage combat has.  I&#146;m sure the non-Jedi deck on everyone&#146;s mind is Watch Your Step.  WYS can get really big drains going at Kessel, the Cantina, and I&#146;ll Take The Leader-enhanced drains at the docking bays.  It can also satisfy Battle Plan and Menace Fades early thanks to all the force the combat player gives away, which makes sure that the combat player is paying three force for each drain that can&#146;t get higher than two.  WYS also is a very balanced deck that has one of the cheapest and most rewarding space fleets the light side has, which should make sure the dark side player can never satisfy Battle Order.  Quiet Mining Colony is similar to WYS, because it is generally cheap and can get Pucumir-boosted drains going quickly.  It is also easy to set up Battle Plan and Menace Fades early and can drain for a good amount using non-Jedi.  Path Of Least Resistance will keep your guys safe from EPP-strikes.  Both of these decks also have great retrieval, which is a big edge against combat.<br>
<br>
An incredibly powerful dark side deck that I&#146;m surprised I haven&#146;t seen more of is ISB Operations.  Not only does the ISB objective give you boosted drains with non-Jedi, and not only is ISB Operations usually based around enclosed vehicles (an advantage I discussed earlier) but ISB Operations can also easily limit drains.  All you have to do is play the Spaceport Docking Bay in your deck and attach it to the combat player&#146;s Naboo locations.  Either put an ISB agent in a walker there, or better yet put 5d6 at the location and the light side&#146;s drains are reduced by one at each of their Naboo locations.  Since the Spaceport Docking Bay is not an interior location, they can&#146;t &quot;death finger&quot; your droid, and if you are playing ISB space and can get Imperial Decree set up, then you can easily make your opponent pay six force to drain you for two a turn.<br>
<br>
This covers some of the better non-Jedi decks that you can play to beat combat.  But what if you want to be a real old-schooler and keep playing your Jedi?  There are a couple of ways you can modify your old decks to make them able to beat combat.<br>
<br>
The first thing you have to keep in mind is that the success of combat’s duels is based around high destiny.  This means that, in order to keep your Jedi from being dueled off the table, your destiny has to be high.  You can assume that combat will never be able to draw a total of more than fifteen no matter what they do, so all you have to do is stay within five of this number and your Jedi will always be safe.  So what are some good ways to stack some high destiny?  Obviously Janus Greejatus, Mirax Terrik and Threepio With His Parts Showing are some of the best ways to stack a single card quickly.  But you need two cards stacked, which means you need a couple of easily-recyclable interrupts in your deck.  One of my favorites is the old technique people used to use in dueling Hunt Down; Operational As Planned + Masterful Move + Visage Of The Emperor.  This allows you to stack three high destinies easily, and if you are capable of counting high enough to know how many cards are in your reserve deck then you can get those three cards on top of your deck with no problem.  The light side has several high-destiny recyclable interrupts such as Throw Me Another Charge, Fall Of The Legend, A Few Maneuvers, Free Ride &amp; Endor Celebration and The Bith Shuffle &amp; Desperate Reach.<br>
<br>
So now that you have high-enough destinies to survive their duels, how do you gain the upper hand in the damage war?  Obviously, even if you keep your Jedi on the table, you will most likely be taking duel damage during every one of your opponent&#146;s move phases.  So what can you do to even the score a little?  The best and most obvious technique is to cause some battle damage.  Drop down a bunch of destiny-adding mains and pound on Qui-Gon until he screams like a little schoolgirl.  The problem with combat is that they generally play a lot of battle evasion cards, which stop you from doing damage to them.  Luckily, there are plenty of ways to cancel battle evasion, such as Desperate Reach, Blast Door Controls, Those Rebels Won&#146;t Escape Us, and of course Sense.  A lot of combat decks have started playing SAC themselves to protect against these cards.  First of all, playing SAC in a deck that plays multiple sevens is a risky thing for a combat deck, and thanks to Defensive Shields they will most likely be taking damage every time they play one.  Secondly, almost all evasion cards are lost interrupts; this means that if you keep the pressure on them enough, they will eventually run out of evasion cards or they will have to move their Jedi away from the site to prevent being beaten down.  This means you are free to drain at their location, and if you have a Jedi there your opponent will not be draining.  If you&#146;re doing damage to your opponent, and they aren&#146;t doing damage to you, then there is only one possible outcome of the game.<br>
<br>
I saved the best anti-combat card for last: Darth Sidious.  Since light side combat can&#146;t function without Jedi,  all  you have to do is kill Qui-Gon, Luke or Obi one time and they will never be on the table again.  Even if they avoid your battle, Sniper can take them out when your Jedi survives a duel.  Darth Sidious is sort of a &quot;beating combat for dummies&quot; card, but he gets the job done at a cost of only one force to yourself.<br>
<br>
I realize this is not an exhaustive article on all the ways to beat combat, but when I play combat myself these are some things I keep in mind.  Contrary to popular belief, there are quite a few bad matches for lightsaber combat and if a lot of people play them for a while you will be able to make combat an unpopular deck for anyone to bring to a tournament.  Maybe then we can feel safer playing about playing our Jedi mains and bring some of the fun decks back to the game.  I hope this article helped some of you, and if you have some tips of your own on beating combat please include them in your review.  Keep the game alive, and may the force be with you. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="articles.php3"><img src="images/aback.GIF" border="0"></a><A HREF="articleread.php3?article=3659"><IMG SRC="images/aread.GIF" BORDER=0></A><A HREF="articlereview.php3?article=3659"><IMG SRC="images/areview.GIF" BORDER=0></A><a href="articleprint.php3?article=3659" TARGET="BLANK_"><img src="images/aprint.gif" border="0"></a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </td>
