Don&#146;t ever underestimate the power of the dark side. Here are some tips to beat these powerful dark side decks.<br>
<br>
HOW TO BEAT BRANGUS RACING<br>
<br>
This can be a pretty nasty deck in the hands of a good dark side player, a poor deck in the hands of a mediocre or worse player. This deck relies on causing huge force loss and retrieval by winning the podrace with watto&#146;s box and plenty of podracer collisions. Once they win the race though they can have a hard time dealing more damage. 3720-1 and maybe a sabbac or 2 along with battling is pretty much their offense. Brangus glee with the docking bay retrieval gives them lasting power and the ability to play cards from lost pile but it can be stopped. Here are some good cards that destroy this deck:<br>
<br>
WAYTTPOU- grab their PASOA or whatever interrupt they are playing again and again and cut off their db retrieval for the most part.<br>
<br>
AIM HIGH- make them pay for their retrieval if they win the race and make them pay for any other retrieval.<br>
<br>
SAC- These decks usually start the box and have very little sac or sac protection. This can take out their interrupts and effects easily.<br>
<br>
HONOR- these decks have problems occupying 3 battlegrounds so this will subtract the force loss from racing, first strike, and 3720-1 among other things.<br>
<br>
Out of commisson- I don&#146;t reccommend playing these or many of them but very good against brangus racing. place out of play their dbs, podradcer collisions,etc and take away some force retrieval. This card will probably get grabbed or cnaceled by this is some rescue by the dark side.<br>
<br>
WYS objective-absolutely wrecks their activation and deadly when combined with aim high.<br>
<br>
<br>
HOW TO BEAT WALKERS<br>
<br>
This is a solid dark side deck but so easy to beat its not funny. Just prevent their direct damage and they can&#146;t do much.Here are MANY  easy to use cards that win you games against walkers:<br>
<br>
HONOR OF THE JEDI- Unless they occupy 3 battlegrounds then their damage from YMSYL and rebel base occpation is cancelled.<br>
<br>
HOTH DB- this not only takes away a force from them every turn but it makes the hoth db a nonbattleground. Combined with honor of the jedi and their only battlegrounds available are the defensive perimeter and any systems they play. <br>
<br>
MPG- You really shouldn&#146;t play this but if you did with honor you win the game.<br>
<br>
ENDOR CELEBRATION- not a bad card in any deck, especially RST. Occupation decks have been coming back for dark side  lately and if you don&#146;t have the space to stop them this is a good alternative. <br>
<br>
CONTROL/TUNNEL VISION-Cancel their ice storm or a big drain if you could&#146;t pull off menace fades.<br>
<br>
BEN KENOBI- These decks don&#146;t play any real weapons that you have to worry about so all your guys are safe where they go. If you are going to have constant battles with their walkers then just lose one guy to attrition and revive him every turn. Nothing they can do.<br>
<br>
BACTA TANK- Same as Ben but helps with constant space battles too.<br>
<br>
DONT DO THAT AGAIN- This deck needs mob points to get executor and to activate extra at their docking bay. Just make pulling executr that much harder and pull a grabber to grab pesky pimp commands or tramples.<br>
<br>
MENACE FADES- cancels force drain bonuses from the defensive perimeter, admiral chiraneau, and more importantly walker garrison.<br>
<br>
<br>
HOW TO BEAT ISB-<br>
ISB pretty much sucks now. Its biggest stength is its ability to make all opponents force drains -1 at related locations and to make your force drains +1 at same sites as your ISB agent. Below are some cards that absolutely wreck ISB.<br>
<br>
RST(flip side)- It states your drains on endor may not be modified or cancelled where you have a rebel scout. That means not den of thieves and no making your force drains -1 with the ISB objective. <br>
<br>
QMC(flip side)- Same as above but the force drains cannot be modified or cancelled at same location as an alien. If you play QMC I&#146;m sure you have put in or though about putting in an extra alien or two because of ISB.<br>
<br>
UNDERWORLD CONTACTS- This is WYS way to beat ISB. Where you have 2 different titled aliens your force drains may not be modified or cancelled. <br>
<br>
MENACE FADES- Cancels any drain bonuses from the ISB objective or Admiral chiraneau.<br>
<br>
DON&#146;T DO THAT AGAIN- with ISBs horrible activation on its own it will probably try to play mob points. With this simple card they are force choked. <br>
<br>
BLOUNT- He&#146;s a decent character that destroys the ISB objective. Luckily for light side, ISB is so bad right now that he is hardly neccassary but he is a decent addition to some decks.<br>
<br>
<br>
HOW TO BEAT TIES(look at my deck &quot;ROLLIN&quot; for an example of a tie deck with tallon rolls)<br>
<br>
Ties are a very powerful deck if not prepared for. Their retrieval and spread-and-drain tactics can be pretty hard to deal with sometimes.Tie lasers and tallon rolls add to the challenge. It is a very beatable deck though and the cards below are great at defeating ties.<br>
<br>
WYS OBJECTIVE- Crush thier force activation as well as add battle destinies and play interrupts from lost pile.<br>
<br>
BATTLE PLAN- Your deck should easily be able to occupy at least one site and one system and most tie decks won&#146;t be able to occupy a battle ground site, or at least not for long. Make them pay to drain.Great combined with WYS.<br>
<br>
AIM HIGH-Make them pay to retrieve with first strike, sienar fleet systems, and short range fighter. Great when combined with WYS.<br>
<br>
I&#146;LL TAKE THE LEADER- Only should be used by hidden mains and WYS because they can take advantage of the db parts. Reduces their ships power and boosts your ships immunity.Watch out for them replacing your AO though. As I said, it works even better if you are playing docking bays.<br>
<br>
GS1- I use this instead of the original falcon most times because it has an extra maneuver (against tie cannons) and it is immune to tallon roll.<br>
<br>
OUTRIDER/DASH-everyone plays this. Immune to tallon roll and subtracts a lot of power against any deck.<br>
<br>
PROFIT OBJECTIVE- while not a great deck, profit has always been a tie decks enemy. All the unstoppable direct damage is too much for ties.The only thing they can do is play one or 2 Set for stuns on han.<br>
<br>
I HOPE SHEs ALL RIGHT- I don&#146;t think this card works against any other dark side deck (except maybe brangus racing) but i usually put it in anyways. It guarantees a win for you against ties.<br>
<br>
 <br>
HOW TO BEAT DS MAINS-<br>
Mains are making a comeback for dark side and aren&#146;t doing too bad in my opinion. Probably the most solid dark side deck or close to it. It plays the big characters ans plenty of support characters and usually has a decent space package. SAC is sometimes played too. Here is how to beat this deck:<br>
<br>
MENACE FADES/BATTLE PLAN- Occupying space and ground quickly and still being strong in both areas is easier for light side then the dark side so play these two cards and make them pay.<br>
<br>
INSURRECTION-makes their elis helrots pretty useless<br>
<br>
WYS OBJECTIVE-cancels SAC <br>
<br>
DODN/WA- If you are not playing WYS or SAC then play one of these to make their senses and alters pretty much useless.<br>
<br>
GOO NEE TAY- hurts their deck a lot because they don&#146;t usually have very good activation. <br>
<br>
BACTA TANK- Gives the light side player the battling advantage in the long run.<br>
<br>
Well these are the best dark side decks right now and this is how to beat them. I hope they will help you in your next tourney or two before coruscant comes out. Thanks for reading.<br>
