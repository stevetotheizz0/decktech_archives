My best friend had been playing it with his son and was very anxious to introduce me to the game. I was skeptical. After our first contest, I pronounced the game arbitrary and confusing. We played three more games that night - with me determined to give it a fair chance and (I realize now) completely addicted. My friend lent me his sons decks and we went to a tournament the next day where I won my first 2 and lost my last 4. I came away happy with my performance. I received a starter deck for finishing near the bottom of the pack. I also got a Hoth Booster, a Dagobah Booster, and a door prize (a Tie Fighter computer game). Before my friend left town he gave me a bunch of cards to start my collection - including a black border Darth Vader and white border Luke Skywalker.  I was off to a good start.<br>
<br>
The deck that most impressed me in that first tournament was an Asteroid Sanctuary (post Asteroid Sanctuary errata) / Never Tell Me the Odds deck. Now dont laugh. What impressed me with this deck was the way it seemed to capture the essence of one of my favorite parts of the trilogy in a winning strategy. Here was the intrepid rebel band challenging the big blue Imperial fleet to venture into the asteroid belt and be blown to bits. I thought it was the perfect deck - the rebellion doing more with less. Also, you could build it quite cheaply. I didnt know it was cheese.<br>
<br>
I proceeded to hunt down the cards necessary to build a similar deck. When I got it built, I started taking it to tournaments. I became known as the guy with the asteroid deck. I changed and tweaked it until it had a pretty good track record - reluctantly retiring it when I realized that I only knew how to play one deck style and that all of my regular opponents knew exactly what was coming.<br>
<br>
As I became more of a student of the game, I learned that there was much debate over the concept of cheese decks and strategies. To my dismay, I learned that nearly everybody considered Asteroid Sanctuary and Never Tell me the Odds to be cheese. Here I had been playing the game for many months and having a great time; only to learn that many of my opponents felt that I was using an inherently unfair, cheap and un-Star Wars deck.<br>
<br>
I was a good player - but hardly dominant. I usually took home a prize but seldom first prize. The dominant players tended to play Mains and Toys with heavy Sense/Alter and multiple mains. At the time, I did not have the cards for Mains and Toys decks. It struck me as unfair that people resented me for playing a deck that anyone could afford while people looked up to players who won with decks that were beyond the financial reach of many.<br>
<br>
Besides, I thought, how is it more Star Wars to have Grand Moff Tarkin coming back from the dead (re-deployed after being killed) repeatedly to cancel your destiny draws? Wasnt Tarkin the guy whose destiny got cancelled? He got blown up. And Vader at Lars Moisture Farm - how Star Wars is that? In the original trilogy, Vader never goes to Tatooine - in fact, he never even goes outside. He makes brief appearances on Hoth and Cloud City but he spends the rest of his time on star ships and on the Death Star. Many of the better players will tell you that Vader is not best utilized in a Star Ship even though he was the best star pilot in the galaxy.  And when was the last time you saw anyone deploy a Death Star site - never mind Darth Vader at a Death Star site?<br>
<br>
If you are looking for them, you can find hundreds of these annoying little discrepancies. In fact, if the game is going to have any what if capability, the discrepancies are required. If the game forced everything to happen the way it did in the movies, there would be no game. So why are some strategies widely considered to be cheesy while others are viewed with respect and admiration?<br>
<br>
I have read many articles and heard many opinions on this point. I have heard that the problem is cards that attack the opponent's life force directly (e.g., Asteroid Sanctuary, Limited Resources, Surprise Assault). I have also heard that the problem stems from cards that encourage non-confrontational strategies (e.g., Never Tell Me The Odds, Dagobah Clouds). Some people claim that strategies that can work so quickly that the opponent has no opportunity to respond (e.g., pre-errata maelstrom, pre-errata operatives, turbo sanctuary, PB3) are the real cheese.<br>
<br>
I think that the common thread through these and other cheese deck theories is that players don't like to face decks that they feel helpless to beat. It is not losing that is the problem; it is the frustration of knowing, almost from the start, that you can't win by playing your strategy. This is the 'rock, paper, scissors' element of the game. The fact is that the very concept of 'customizable' decks entails a certain element of  the 'rock, paper, scissors' game. If that were not the case, then everyone would use a fixed deck of cards and the combination of luck and skill in playing the cards would determine the outcome of each game.<br>
<br>
A large portion of every tournament happens well before the starting time. Players build, tweak, and playtest their decks -- hoping to create decks that they can use to beat any of the decks they might face. Most of us work very hard to balance our decks and consider the best ways to counter each potential threat while still pursuing our offensive strategies. I happen to find this element of the game very enjoyable. In fact deck construction and analysis is one of the great joys of the game for me -- until I show up at a tournament with the 'paper' and everyone else brought the 'scissors.' Then, of course, I feel frustrated that all my hard work has gone to waste.<br>
<br>
The above situation is not so bad, however, because I can adapt to the 'local meta.' I go home and build a 'scissors' deck. I come back next week and we all play 'scissors.' The player with the best deck and the greatest skill at the table will win.<br>
<br>
The tough situation is when one player brings the 'scissors' and everyone else brings the 'paper.' Now many of the 'paper' players think they have to go home and build 'rock' decks to beat the 'scissors.' If they don't, they think the 'scissors' player will continue to dominate; but, if they do, they know that they will be vulnerable to all the players who stick with 'paper.'  Frustrated with this situation the 'paper' players cry 'cheese deck!'<br>
<br>
Well, I got a bit carried away with the 'rock, paper, scissors' analogy, but I hope you get my point. I think that 'cheese' is any strategy that will consistently beat the prevailing local deck types. Because a great part of the attraction of this game is the chance to play with the main characters, mains and toys is almost always a popular deck type. Thus we have what seems to be a common thread in most cheese deck theories -- almost any deck type that has a really good track record against classic mains and toys decks gets labeled 'cheese.' This is especially true if the best counter to the deck in question is itself vulnerable to mains and toys decks.<br>
<br>
To use a concrete (pre SE) example:<br>
Many players in my area were playing Walker Garrison for the dark side and Mos Eisley Shuffle for the light side. A good match. Both deck types go for big drains and confrontations. If a player lost with one deck it was often easy to see why and have hopes that a tweak here or there (along with learning to avoid certain mistakes) would make you competitive next time. Now along came a player with a Dagobah Clouds w/ Baragwins deck. He made short work of all the Walker Garrison decks he faced. If I wanted to beat his Dagobah deck, I would probably have had to drop the whole Walker Garrison strategy or I would have to put in lots of specific counters for Dagobah Clouds. Most likely I would have to do both. Since the Dagobah deck did not pose the threat of a huge beatdown, I could afford to weaken my dark deck to go for speed drains and to get my fighters and cloud cars to Dagobah.  The problem was that altering my strategy like that made the deck vulnerable to the quick drains and raw power of Mos Eisley shuffle mains and their toys. The very best players, of course, could build and play decks deftly enough to handle both deck types. But for most players it was an exercise in frustration and the Dagobah deck  was labeled 'cheese.'<br>
<br>
I think that most players agree that there is a difference between 'cheese' and a 'broken' card or strategy. A 'broken' strategy is one that strips variety from the game. It is so strong that everyone either uses it or loses to it. The obvious examples are pre-errata operatives and pre-errata asteroid sanctuary. Given the number of cards Decipher has created, I think that there have been remarkably few 'broken' cards and strategies.<br>
<br>
My position on all this is simple: 'cheese' is good. It keeps the game from going stale. As long as the Decipher team does its job and avoids (or remedies) any broken strategies, 'cheese' has a positive influence. It promotes knowledge and use of a wide variety of cards. It gives weaker players a chance to win. Thus encouraging them to stick with the game and become better players. The threat of 'cheese' provides incentive for tournament players to reach the level of those top players for whom an opponent is an opponent, no matter what deck he/she is playing. I am not above pulling the old asteroid sectors out of mothballs every so often - when it seems like nobody is either playing or expecting asteroids and, of course, there are always Skrillings...<br>
