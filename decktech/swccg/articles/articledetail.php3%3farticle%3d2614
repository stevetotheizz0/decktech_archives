<br>
All My Urchins - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/allmyurchins.html <br>
<br>
This card is EXCELLENT in all decks that require you to hold a certain location. This goes well in RST, Profit, the 2 new Coruscant objectives, and any kind of decks that revolves around a certain site. Combined with Order To Engage and few Arconas running around, this is an absolute KILLER. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Ambush - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/ambush.html <br>
<br>
Are trooper decks big in your area? Then this is your card! Is little ol&amp;#8217; Tagge sitting around with a comlink, waiting for some trouble? Well, deploy a couple characters down there and play this card. Bye-bye to Tagge, and hello to your new site to drain for millions at. Sure, they could come right back and deploy tons of troopers, but then you use Throw Me Another Charge to cancel Trooper Assault. Not bad I guess. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Armed and Dangerous - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/armedanddangerous.html <br>
<br>
This card is used occasionally, I know. But not enough! ANY deck that packs sticks NEEDS this card. This card has saved my Obi-Wan from Circle many times. It has saved my Luke and Obi-Wan from Epic Duels a few times. It has helped me slice up Mara Jade for a game-winning move many times. It&amp;#8217;s just too cool, and it&amp;#8217;s a big surprise to boot! Combined with Obi-Wan&amp;#8217;s Journal, it&amp;#8217;s a super-ultra cool card. Keep Luke alone with the Journal at a site and the opponent will think you&amp;#8217;re an idiot. They come down to fight your weak Jedi Knight, but wait! Here comes the saber flying out of your reserve deck, which takes out a low destiny and let&amp;#8217;s you smash his squad with ease. And you can cancel opponent&amp;#8217;s weapon destinies, so your Luke won&amp;#8217;t get touched unless they have 2 lightsabers with extremely good tracking abilities and could expect that to happen... but they won&amp;#8217;t expect it so you win. Whee! Just keep in mind you can&amp;#8217;t play this to get Anakin&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber, because it&amp;#8217;s not specific. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Bionic Hand - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/bionichand.html <br>
<br>
Do you like EPPs? I know I love them. And I also know that the Dark Side hates them, so they pack Disarmed cards. They deploy during your control phase, totally f***ing you up. But wait, here comes Bionic Hand! Now your EPP can hit things with ease with the +1 bonus to weapon destiny and they are power +1, which helps with Circle and You&amp;#8217;ll Find I&amp;#8217;m Full Of Surprises. Also, a destiny 7 doesn&amp;#8217;t hurt at all. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Crack Shot - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/index.html <br>
<br>
Do you like playing with the Blastech repeating rifles as much as I do? Well, if you do, then this card is for you! Blast away all of their characters, then none of them can satisfy attrition! I like it a lot! It&amp;#8217;s good for the upcoming Jedi too, because they will most likely have to use Jedi Lightsabers from Premiere, and this card makes them practically unique sabers. Not bad! <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Dark Approach - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/darkapproach.html <br>
<br>
Well here&amp;#8217;s a card that I use a TON (granted I only have 1, but...). What deck uses weapons? Let&amp;#8217;s see... all of them! With Coruscant coming up, I&amp;#8217;m guessing we&amp;#8217;ll be a seeing a ton of Jedi with sticks running around. This makes this card that much more powerful. Who hates Maul/Vader/Emperor/Mara? I know I do. Well, if you have any kind of weapon there, then this card is the killer. Deploy an EPP to Emperor&amp;#8217;s site, initiate a battle and then play this card. He&amp;#8217;s gonna have to lose him, and this is a definite killer to BHBM and SYCFA decks (which use him at the docking bay). Of course, you&amp;#8217;ll have to lose your guy too, but I think it&amp;#8217;s worth the trade. Also, in TIGIH decks where you NEED to win battles (or in the upcoming Hyperdrive objective), then you can play this and add a destiny to your power, which will many times push you over the edge. I like it! <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Dash - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/dash.html <br>
<br>
Alright I know this card is used a lot nowadays, but I still don&amp;#8217;t see it enough. This card is absolutely a killer card. Just save 3 force and move your Qui-Gon, LSJK, Obi-Wan, DOS, Han, Chewbacca... you get the point... to a battle and devastate him. Yea, it&amp;#8217;s free on a scout, but I think this card is useful in any occasion. I always try to pack 2 in each of my decks. It&amp;#8217;s just too good! <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Dismantle On Sight - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/dismantleonsight.html <br>
<br>
In my local &amp;#8217;meta&amp;#8217;, I see nothing but 4-LOM, IG-88, and Guri running around stomping on my characters. I especially hate 4-LOM. Anyways, this card is the answer to all 3 of them! Unless they are playing pure scum (which is getting rare), this card will easily rock any big badazz droid. I guess it depends on your local meta, but hey, doesn&amp;#8217;t everything? I guess... <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Dodge - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/dodge.html <br>
<br>
I guess this card needs to introduction. However, I still don&amp;#8217;t see it in every light deck. Why not? This card saves games, literally. Every dark deck nowadays packs weapons, be it sticks or blasters. This card saves whatever they&amp;#8217;re shooting at, literally. Also, the more useful part, you can move a lone character away as a &amp;#8217;react&amp;#8217; for FREE. This means no force! Not bad. This is especially good for Jedi decks (like my steaming pile!) where they have to lay a HUGE beatdown to do any kind of damage, then you just move him away and join his buddy Obi-Wan. Not bad. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Fall Of The Empire - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/falloftheempire.html <br>
<br>
This card is a BEAST in Cloud City decks. Just pack in a weather vane, win a battle, and send his character flyin&amp;#8217; into the weather vane! Then play Fall Of The Legend when they want to battle you, and knock his character off the weather vane. It&amp;#8217;s a laugh riot when it happens. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Luke&amp;#8217;s Blaster Pistol - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/lukesblasterpistol.html <br>
<br>
Is your destiny kind of low in your deck, but you pack Luke&amp;#8217;s stick still? Well, take it out for this one! Just target Vader, Emperor, etc and make all his immunity to attrition go down the crapper! It is more effective than you might think. Try it. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/noooooooooooo.html <br>
<br>
Are Hunt Down/BHBM decks big in your area? Then pack this card! It will erradicate BHBM decks. Just when they think they had your Luke, you just play this and he&amp;#8217;s lost! Now drain him to death, because BHBM can&amp;#8217;t do anything without the dueling of Luke. Their drains stink and they&amp;#8217;ve used all their cards on battling. Plus, the look on their face is priceless. Against Hunt Down, you&amp;#8217;ll still have to lose X force, but this can just stop the dark from having another Jedi running around. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Put That Down - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/putthatdown.html <br>
<br>
I&amp;#8217;ve noticed many people playing the new Tatooine card Too Close For Comfort, which makes them use 2 force. That&amp;#8217;s a good card, but if they target on their turn they will usually have 2 force! This card completely stops the targetting. Just pack 1 or 2 of these, and 1 or 2 of Too Close, and you&amp;#8217;re protected from every targetting there is. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Somersault - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/somersault.html <br>
<br>
An absolute DEVASTATING card to ANY light ground deck. I pack 3 of these in my TIGIH decks, because it basically wins battles for you, without having to deploy many cards. Deploy Orimaarko or someone to their Lord Vader, or any combinating of cards that have 7 power. Then battle, play this card, and flip the odds! Now you have 7 power, they have 4. You both draw destiny, say both 3&amp;#8217;s. You won this battle, and if there&amp;#8217;s an Imperial there, that&amp;#8217;s 2 force loss. Then 1 for I Feel The Conflict. So basically you make them forfeit 3 and lose 3. All for deploying Orrimaarko. And remember, that stacks another card for turning Vader. I absolutely love this absolute TECH card. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Surreptitious Glance - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/surreptitiousglance.html <br>
<br>
I&amp;#8217;ve noticed a GREAT rise in Speed Deal decks that don&amp;#8217;t use the Bespin system nor flip. Well, if they&amp;#8217;re big where you are, by all means pack 1 or 2 of this card. It will destroy those decks, because Dark Deal is only immune on the flip side. And even against flipping decks, sometimes they deploy this, and not have anything at Bespin yet. Then you quickly say &quot;interrupt!&quot; and cancel it before they have a chance. It&amp;#8217;s deadly. It&amp;#8217;s cheap. It pisses the hell out of them... <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Wookiee Strangle - http://decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/cloudcity/light/small/wookieestrangle.html <br>
<br>
I love playing with Chewbacca. He can be pulled with Crix, the Protector version is just good, etc. So your total is 8 + destiny, theirs is probably less. But wait, here&amp;#8217;s a neat combo. Although I didn&amp;#8217;t list it, &quot;Higher Ground&quot; is an excellent card to pull out a devastating combo. Play Higher Ground and drop their power by 4, then use this card and choke him! Or you can cancel his game text with Protector&amp;#8217;s text after using Higher Ground (if they add power or something) then use Wookiee Strangle and get the job done. Card intensive, yes, but highly effective. It&amp;#8217;s not wise to upset a wookie. <br>
<br>
