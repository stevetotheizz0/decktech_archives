<br>
Anyone who has ever played or watched a team sport has likely heard this a thousand times. It was the cornerstone philosophy for such venerable coaching legends as Vince Lombardi, Knute Rockne, and the Wizard of Westwood John Wooden. They believed that any potent offense begins with great defense, and their undeniable success proves that they knew what they were talking about. It is true not only in competitive sports, but in any realm where there is competition for survival or some end to be achieved. In Star Wars CCG, this is especially true. So many of the top decks today are designed around a dominant offense, not a dominant defense. Everyones new favorite word is beatdown. Thats purely an offensive concept. Yes, it wins games against those who either stumble into it or cant avoid it. But its not enough in and of itself. The fear of a beatdown is a form of defense in itself. Its meant to deter the opponent from interfering with you and to attempt to punish them if they do. But so many deck descriptions that I read say something to the effect of if they come to visit, bring the beats or simply lay the beats on them anywhere they go. That cant always happen, can it? Suppose I never come to visit you. You are left with a handful of unrealized potential and may just have to deal with me in an arena that youre unprepared to fight in. Operatives are only really useful on their matching planet, as one example. Proper defenses ensure that your opponent will be penalized not only for coming to interfere with you but also for entirely avoiding you. I am not going to sway any top players who have already found a formula that works for them. But for beginners, novices, and those wanting to improve their results, learning to play this way should make you a better all-around player and enhance your enjoyment of the game.<br>
<br>
WOULD YOU BUILD A CASTLE WITHOUT A MOAT?<br>
<br>
Picture yourself as Lord of a realm in centuries past. There are any number of potent enemies against whom you must defend your field. In Star Wars CCG, it isnt the bloodthirsty Celts, the Mongol hordes, or the marauding Ottoman Turks. Its Operatives, swarming X-wings, or powerful main characters replete with weapons and boosting Interrupts. Any of these are capable of offensive domination if left unchecked. Why let that happen? The SW playing universe has never had more options for powerful defensive emplacements than it does today. Consider what your main offensive focus is to be and build the defensive positions first. Think of it as the walls of a castle. The harder they are to penetrate or scale, the better defended your castle is. Most of the key emplacements are Effects, and there are some powerful ones out there which should always be on the drawing board in your deck lab. Standards like Imperial Decree, Resistance/Ultimatum, and Reactor Terminal/Traffic Control have been joined by solid newcomers such as Imperial Arrest Order/Insurrection, Come Here You Big Coward, and Oppressive Enforcement/Wise Advice. These are effects that are not specific to any one strategy but rather counter or enhance several. Each deck I build packs the LS or DS version of each these almost without fail. Does that seem excessive? It shouldnt. How many times have you seen a numbers deck unfold across from you, looked down at your destiny 1 mains and your lack of numbers defense and essentially resigned to losing the game? I refuse to let that happen to me. How about drawing up looking for your Transmission Terminated and wishing you had some way of returning those 20 cards you just drew to your life force? Sound familiar? We are all faced with game situations that could well be addressed by the inclusion of a particular counter or effect in our deck. While it is impossible to pack all of them, packing the ones central to defending your strategy is critical. Consider all options before building the rest of your deck.<br>
<br>
WHAT CARD(S) IN YOUR DECK RANK(S) AS THE MOST IMPORTANT?<br>
<br>
	How would you answer this? Is it Darth Vader, your 12 Alderaan Operatives, your Mos Eisley/Cantina combo, or your Yoda the training master? The answer for me is none of these. You have 60 life force at the start of the game. They are all of equal importance in your deck. When face down and circulating through your Reserve Deck, whats more important to you? A destiny 1 character or a destiny 6 interrupt? Did your answer change from earlier? Consider all cards in your deck to be of equal importance. Each force tossed into your Lost Pile counts against you, regardless of what card it was. The better defended your deck theme is, the less cards youll find yourself tossing away through the course of a game. I dont have to beat your strategy. I only have to drain you of your remaining life force. Thats the object of the game. If you play Operatives and want to spread out, putting 25-30 cards on the table, then what I have to do is survive long enough to drain you of 30-35 cards. Whats the key to doing that? Trying to outdrain you? Probably not likely to happen. But if I can slow you down by one or more means, every drain will start to hurt you as your life force dwindles. In the Operative example, if I play A Bright Center To The Universe (ABCTTU) and cut your drains in half (at least), I have just doubled the number of turns I have to try and drain you out. Think that card just earned a deck slot? You bet. Think Ill commit the forces necessary to keep it on the table and in effect? Absolutely. Ill lose quickly if I dont. That card is better than 10 Vaders in my deck at that point.<br>
<br>
OFFENSE VS DEFENSE<br>
<br>
	The reason this article is entitled The Art of Defense in an Enhanced World is because so many decks contain Enhanced-edition cards now. Whether its EPP Luke and Obi dropping and slicing or Zuckuss In Mist Hunter and Dengar in Punishing One eliminating rebel fleets a few ships at a time, the universe has changed since the arrival of these combo powerhouses. These cards are great for conserving deck slots and they provide unique abilities and a great offensive punch as well. So consider that you will see at least one Enhanced combo card in any deck you face. How will you defend against that? Can you see how those cards are somewhat defensive by themselves? Certainly Zuckuss In Mist Hunter with that ability requirement is defensive. Theres much to consider now when building decks.<br>
<br>
When I build a deck, I have a very definite order of operations. How many of you go for characters first? How about starships and weapons? Where do effects rank in your order of deckbuilding? If the answer is last or next to last, you may want to consider changing that. I have always built decks by selecting a theme, choosing locations appropriate to that theme, and then going straight to the effects necessary to defend that theme. I never vary from that. I have been known to play with as many as 13 effects in a deck on many occasions. I have one for almost every occasion. If I dont pack an effect to counter a particular strategy, than I have some other variant in the deck to counter it. I dont enter the fray unprepared. Thats not to say that my decks are all red cards. Far from it. My decks are simply loaded with what I need to defend what Im doing and to limit what you can do to me. If I can do that with 7 effects and an interrupt or two, Im happy with that. If it takes 15-20 red cards, so be it. My decks will not beat themselves. If my opponent presents a strategy that I am completely unprepared to play against, my deck is now working against me and I have failed. I choose not to let that happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
HOW DO YOU BUILD A DEFENSE?<br>
<br>
	If youre with me this far, the inevitable next question is what level of defense is the ideal? The answer, of course, depends on your chosen strategy. A large offensive force stacked at a location is defense in itself. I dont want to come and deal with that much power for fear of heavy losses. Thats a form of defense. Trouble is, to maintain that kind of offensive domination everywhere, you would need a complex strategy and a lot of cards on the table. My preferred balance is to figure on controlling two or three locations with substantial power and having to counter the rest. Anything more than that is likely spreading too thin. Operative decks or decks which utilize a reactable force can be exceptions to this because they allow for an expanded front of coverage. Sometimes this can work against them (Frozen Assets, characters that prevent reacts), but they need to account for those possibilities. I break it down by asking myself the following questions:<br>
<br>
What is my main theme or intent?<br>
What opposing strategies are direct counters to this?<br>
What opposing strategies does my strategy inherently protect against?<br>
What cards hurt my strategy?<br>
What are the defenses against those cards?<br>
What locations would help me in my strategy?<br>
What counter cards would assist me in my strategy?<br>
<br>
From that, I can build a deck. Heres an example<br>
<br>
My deck: HB with mains and toys<br>
Opposing strategies: DS Ops (any flavor), Dark Deal (Obj. or non), Raltiir Ops, Numbers, etc.<br>
Strategies defended: DS Space, DS ground with no space (i.e. Alien/capture deck)<br>
Cards that hurt: Security Precautions, Lateral Damage, Homing Beacon, -1 Objectives, Battle Order<br>
Defenses: ICBW, Sense/Alter, Undercover Spies, Rebel Barrier, TPTIFF<br>
Locations: Kessel, Coruscant (both +1), Kiffex (straight 2), Bothawui (guards UC), Dagobah (point for TPTIFF), a couple drain 1 systems.<br>
Helper cards: TPTIFF, Rebel Barrier, OTE, DTF/FA (perhaps), Sense/Alter, Bacta Tank<br>
<br>
This deck is 20+ cards built and I have no characters or starships yet. Those are the easy cards. You know what you want those to be already or you wouldnt have chosen HB. Include those last and make things fit as best you can. Dont sacrifice from your theme. Your deck has to work.<br>
<br>
WHAT DO I NEED TO PLAN FOR?<br>
<br>
	How many of you hate seeing Undercover spies? Quite a few of you, Id imagine. Many of you may pack a counter such as Bubo or Sorry About The Mess/Sniper. But how many of you pack more than  one of those? Should you? If your strategy is predominantly ground-based, Id say yes. You dont want your precious site drains blocked by an unobtrusive little alien with an Undercover slapped on him. Consider that in your deck construction. If you are playing HDADTJ, how much do you rely on Visage damage to beat your opponent? How many Visages do you pack? How about Ephant Mon to keep spies off your Executor sites? Is he in there? How about Holonet Transmission? Its up to you how many cards you devote to defensive measures. A good rule of thumb might be this: name off a number of the popular opposing strategies and, for each one, name at least one counter or defensive measure your deck contains against it, even if its just a U3PO to block one ground drain. If you can name at least one counter to all the big ones, youve done well. If you cant, you need to assess what options you have to include them. Look at cards that serve more than one purpose. One great example is Jeroen Webb (LS from Hoth). Hes an ability 2 rebel (Insurrection), a spy, and a pilot. Hes offense and defense. There are several cards like Jeroen that can server multiple functions in any deck. The more functions your 60 cards can serve, the better off you are. Thats all part of the defensive makeup of any deck.<br>
<br>
WILL THIS LET ME BEAT RALTIIR OPS?<br>
<br>
     I cannot guarantee you success in every game you play. Even the top players in the world lose from time to time. I have seen a number of younger players in my area start to evolve towards strategies with defense. In other words, I see them getting better every time I play them. Thats a great thing. I stand behind this philosophy of deck construction because it has worked so well for me. I pride myself on never being totally unprepared for the deck placed across from me. I recognize what my opponent is doing and I adjust to it. I also err on the side of caution, which helps to avoid stumbling into those beatdowns we hear so much about. Sometimes Im too tentative and it costs me in a close game, but thats part of the learning process. Find your own style and get comfortable with it. To me, its frustrating to play out a game that you know youll lose simply because your opponent is playing something you cant stop. Adopt the art of defense into your style of play and youll find what over 40 tournament titles has taught me<br>
