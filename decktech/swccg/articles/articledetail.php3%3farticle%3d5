<br>
Well, it has been about a month since we first ripped open our Endor packs.  At that point I decided I would reserve judgement on the set until I had played with it (and against it) for a bit.  Here is my conclusion after a month.	Things may change, I may have missed something, but for now I feel Endor is, &#8220;Much Ado About Nothing.&#8221;  There has been little is my mind that makes the set stand out.  Endor&#8217;s effect on the metagame is more subtle than the past two sets, Jabba&#8217;s Palace and Special Edition, bringing old strategies out to try again, rather than provide us with new ones..<br>
<br>
Let&#8217;s start with a look at Endor itself.	Even the system tells you that Endor is largely a place for the Dark Side.  At the system the DS has the ability to drain for 2 here if its own Endor is out.  The LS can not do this.	Also the DS can drain for 2 if the LS version is out, provided they have an Imperial on Endor.	Generally the DS has better drains on Endor sites, having the Dark Forest for +1 and the Ewok Village for +1 if no Ewoks on Endor, which does happen quite often, as the LS has little reason to be there.<br>
<br>
The LS has the Back Door and the Bunker has the only place they can drain for 2.  And the bunker is often the target of being blown away using the LS objective.  For the LS objective to stay flipped the Bunker must be blown away, destroying a nice drain of two in the process.  The LS does have Ithorians to boost up the drains, but if you are going to go that route, why not play operatives and get the &#8211;1 for your opponent&#8217;s force drains, operative bonuses and be able to stick the Ithorians on the Bargaining Table.<br>
<br>
Other than that the LS has a host of new mains and Ewoks to hold down Endor, while the DS gets Biker Scouts.  The LS mains are an interesting bunch.  They new Leia is certainly a fine card, good for MWYHL, and the extra icons boosts those Ewoks.  But for my money, I will stick with the EPP version.  I like General Han, because his ability to cancel a destiny draw is powerful.  But again I prefer the EPP version for the ground and nothing beats the Captain in space.  EPP Leia and Captain Han on the Falcon is a wonderful 3 destiny draw machine.  So either old Han wins out in my book.  The new Chewie is nice but the roar doesn&#8217;t prevent choking or trampling, which is how most of my Chewie&#8217;s bite the dust anyway.  And if I am not going to be on Endor, the higher deploy kills him.	I do like is Bowcaster though.<br>
<br>
Ewoks on the other hand, just do not seem to match up.	Getting them to the point where they have reasonable power and forfeit is a card intensive chore.  In fact the only reason I would consider playing them is to man my Ewok catapults.  But even the catapult needs either lots of Ewok help or rigged destinies.  True ASP droid abuse is one good idea for these destiny 7 weapons, but again I find that a little to card intensive as well.	Overall, despite some decent unique Ewok game text, I think I will just pass on the Ewoks.<br>
<br>
The DS gets its Biker Scouts and their rides, which can be effective.  The ability to move as a react is always a potential gamebreaker.  But again, this is pretty card intensive as well, with both the scouts and bikes.  If I am going to have 8 non-unique cards in my deck, they better be named Sense or Alter or at least allow me to cancel drains by putting them on the Den of Thieves or their imperial/starfighter equivalent and retrieve force later.  The bikes do neither.  Surprise Assault is a problem as is Obi making a Bike and Trooper move away.  Still the scouts are not a bad deal, get Raithal on the table and they become destiny four or five, perfect for a numbers deck.<br>
<br>
Both sides&#8217; objectives hardly seem worth the effort.  The LS has to destroy a good drain of two to keep the objective flipped.  Then they can drain for one without interference.  And the DS objective is equally complex but boasts a better return, mainly due to their superior draining locations, but requires space dilution.  Again, I am not sure I would want to play this.<br>
<br>
Of course Endor has other cards than just the Endor location centered stuff.  It has impacted the metagame in other ways as well. Let&#8217;s take a look at these.<br>
<br>
Battle Plan/Order &#8211; This was supposed to be a real metabreaker, but it is not, at least in my area.  Many people see the space/ground deck dichotomy as something to be avoided at all costs.  The opinion is that I won&#8217;t hose your strategy if you won&#8217;t hose mine.  Building a deck that can match a ground deck on the ground and an opposing space deck in space is difficult.  This card&#8217;s only real effect has been to enhance Revolution and prevent both sides from early drains.  At least it hurts drop and drain ISB, which I guess was the card&#8217;s intent anyway.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Revolution it seems to be the current LS craze.  And it can be a tricky deck against those that are unprepared for it.  But now everyone has heard of it.  If you do not ask yourself the question of ,&#8221;How does my deck deal with Revolver?&#8221;, you are missing something.  But as Revolver becomes more popular the counters will become equally popular.  The Death Star will become a popular place for the DS to begin the day.<br>
<br>
Dark Side space has become more popular as a result of Revolution, but also as the result of Security Precautions.  The beatdown version of HB is less often played now, although the threat of losing a big chuck of force to SP is overrated.  With the huge activation that HB provides, one good It Could Be Worse could solve the problem.  But the lack of beatdown is something for which it is harder to compensate.  Sure you can beatdown after they probe, but it seems a long way to go for that benefit, as you lose the ability to cancel drains.  However, the threat of Operatives still haunts DS space, leaving the DS with only a drain of four at best.  So although a friendlier place to be, DS space is still not as attractive as it was pre-SE.<br>
<br>
So, how do you stop operatives?  Well, the character based counters in Endor are a nice idea, but unless I know I am playing against Ops, I will have to pass.	Commandos and Navy Troopers just don&#8217;t cut it in most decks.  I do like the idea of using Always Thinking with Your Stomach/ Lost in the Wilderness to hurt Ops, as you can not voluntarily deploy another to where the first is missing.  But there are usually enough sites to get the objective flipped anyway, and a few senses ruins this strategy.	Furthermore it is hard to find room for those cards.  With the limited mobility that Imperial Arrest Order/Insurrection can provide a opponent looking to off your Ops, Operative decks seem to be here to stay, even if they get getting a bit worn out.<br>
<br>
One big deal is Imperial Arrest Order/ Insurrection.  Taking away the LS&#8217;s mobile main strategy is huge.	The DTF/ Frozen Asset combo, which made one immune to Oota &#8211; Goota is much less effective now that the Nabrun comes after the battle phase.  The DS does not suffer as much, as the big DS hitters, aside from Vader , Tarkin, and Fett were largely mechanical based vehicles, which were going no where via Elis anyway.  Now that the DS has more vehicles in the form of AT-ST&#8217;s and bikes, Elis is even less important.  On the other hand, adding 2 forfeit to character like the DS boys and Biggs adds tremendously to their playability.  Finally the DS gets a little more advantage from Arrest Order, as it can be used to fetch the Hoth Docking Bay and the Cloud City Docking Bay, two no-benefit-to-revolve non-nudjable sites.  Generic docking bay can help too.	This makes Arrest Order an ideal anti-revolution starting interrupt choice.  This card lead me to consider playing ISB again, as before I thought it was too revolver prone to work.<br>
<br>
So what are people playing?  Operatives is still going strong, and the ability to pull Bubo at the DS Jungle to keep your planet Nudj free is attractive.  However, operative decks now pack as much surpirse value as the sun rising in the morning, at most players will account for them in the metagame.  ISB and Hunt Down live on thanks to Imperial Arrest order, although ISB fairs better due to the overall cheaper deploy of agents vs. mains like Vader.  The LS is scrambling a little.  Revolver is the answer for now, but soon everyone will catch on to this one, and it will fade in importance.  I am seeing a lot of Monk/Mains/OMDH these days, but I think the LS is looking for an answer.<br>
<br>
In general, look for the shields to go back up on Sense/Alter, as the return to older strategies seems to support SAC.	Also look for decks you never thought you would see again show their faces in tournaments.  Be on the lookout for DS Manipulation to begin again, due to the increased ability of both sides to activate more force quickly, Miiyoom is waiting to see some action.  For the LS It Could Be Worse could reappear as well.  Both sides will begin to pack undercover spies in number again as it seems the shields are still down on anti-spy tech.<br>
<br>
Endor will be remember not so much for what it allowed us to discover, but rather what we will re-discover.<br>
