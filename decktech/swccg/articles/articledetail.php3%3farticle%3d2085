.<br>
At first glance, The Dark Side TOTALLY got the better cards.  Xizor hauls, Guri?s decent, and Snoova is the man.  Thrawn and Pallaeon are both damn good.  Arica looks good, and is surprisingly better than most would believe.  After playing with her once, I?ll continue to use at least one of her in scum decks.<br>
Yet after some play testing and deck building, I&#146;ve come to the conclusion that the light side got a better deal.	It&#146;s new objective is DAMN good, and I mean surprisingly good despite it&#146;s deployment restrictions, and I feel it got more characters that will weasel there way into more decks.<br>
This is the first time in quite awhile that I?ve been able to come up with more Light Side decks I have confidence in then Dark Side?<br>
<br>
Let?s take a closer look at what Dark Side really got, and what it should affect.<br>
<br>
Of big news to Scum decks of the non swarm variety is Xizor and Snoova.  These two characters are definitely of main caliber, with high power and not overblown deploy.  Heck, with a scum deck Snoova could often come out for free!<br>
On the other hand, a coupla new heavy hitter characters never makes or breaks the deck.  Neither have a lot of support cards, and when you get down to it, you just made it a tad harder for the opponent to invade, or a tad easier for you to smack him up.<br>
<br>
Jabba?s Prize looks pretty good, but after playing this deck, I?d have to say court/MKOS is still better.  You have to haul that pretty boy all the way to the audience chamber, meaning your just moving guys trying to get there.  You need to allocate enough guys to protect him, making it hard for you to hit the opponent elsewhere.  You will be divided and conquered, or they?ll just get their game plan going and start the pain.  Once you flip, you get that extra force back a turn, and some immunity? great.  &lt;4 is not much in today?s world.  Jabba?s a beast and hard to kill, but will that make or break the game?  Not particularly.	It will only help when they try to come free Han, which they will either be able to do, cause you lost too much crap bringing him over, or they won?t, cause you?ve stocked boelo+jabba+4-lom+ephant-mon and haven?t really hit the table much yet.  The only reason to play this kind of scum rather than others is for Scanning Crew, and to take Han out.<br>
<br>
Agents of Black Sun, I can?t give any thoughts on how things have turned out with this yet.  The flip side is very powerful, and you get tons of force early on, but the new LS objective limits this pretty quick, and it is VERY easy to flip back.  A little  harder than Hunt Down to flip back, but I?d say it?s also harder to kill Luke, since you can?t use Vader or Mara.  It causes some profit like damage, which is damn good, and is an uncancellable substitute for Visage.  I?d say the main things against this deck is killing Luke easily, and getting a hold of the 3 (at least!) Xizors to play it.  Possibilities could be to use multiple Boba?s and Jodo Kast?s, plus some hidden weapons.  Snoova and Ig-88 capturing could be a nice solution too.<br>
<br>
The combo cards for Dark Side, I find at least are lacking.  Abyssin Ornament &amp; Wounded Wookie is definitely a good one for MKOS swarms, and maybe even Mains too.	Sunsdown &amp; Too Cold for Speeders would make a good occupation deck if you?re worried about speeders?  and Sniper &amp; Dark Strike is sweet.  Control and set for stun?  Yes please!   Other than those, there?s nothing really eye popping to me that?ll find there way into most decks.  Some specific cases, but not wide and far reaching, or game changing.<br>
<br>
The advent of the double anti-sac cards will definitely help bring out Scum over BHBM/Huntdown.  Not necessarily better, but bringing it up.  In my opinion, both of the latter decks are best used with SAC to just control the game, and not allow the opponent to do anything.  Scum, on the other hand, has some nasty interrupts that were always best faced with a Sense.  None Shall Pass, Hidden Weapons, and Imperial Barrier are the main ones that come to mind, but not the only.<br>
<br>
Thrawn and Pallaeon are pretty damn sweet, but nothing earth shattering.  Neither will suddenly make Dark Side space that much better.	Playing with two copies of the Chimera in an Imperial Command deck is probably worth it now, but that?s about it.<br>
<br>
So in summary, Scum has gotten a boost, BHBM/Huntdown took a bit of a dive, Carbon Chamber Testing is still not the greatest thing ever, and there is still better stuff than the new dark side objective.  The combo cards aren?t that far reaching, and rarely will I be using more than two in a deck.<br>
<br>
Light side is a different story?<br>
<br>
When you look at the character selection, It?s almost all a bunch of support characters.  Talon, Mirax, Corran are all worth playing with but, but it?s not like they?re going to make your opponent lie down and weep.  Leebo is good for Kessel runs, and that?s it.	Dash is the man for space, but his immunity lacks.<br>
<br>
The biggest news for Light Side is Watch Your Step.  THIS OBJECTIVE HAULS.  People, if you didn?t play with Secret Plans in your deck before this, do it now, or lose to anyone who can play this deck properly.  This deck can track like mad for On the Edge/Off the Edge, and can start placing those out of play to guarantee some force retrieval in the end game.  Grabbers aren?t a sure fire way to stop their extra retrieval either, there?s also the Kessel Run possibility.  I scoffed at the Kessel Run version until I played against a decent version of it.  If kessel run somehow gets buried, they can effective repairs it? and then again from the lost pile.  Plus, again because of the mad tracking, two destinies with smugglers HURTS.  I was seeing at least nine attrition every battle.  I haven?t even seen the Palace Raider version yet?<br>
<br>
Talon Karrde is a decent character, but his main use comes into Watch Your Step.  The +2 defense value he gives smugglers is VERY worthwhile, Chewie protector becomes six, Han is a 5, and he himself becomes 5.  This prevents the opponent from blindly using Dengar, Ig-88, Boba Fett to blast your guys.<br>
<br>
Mirax is sweet as can be.  Janus for the light side?  Oh yeah.	And wait, she can sit in her ship and get some immunity?  Oh man.  If you?ve played BHBM/Huntdown with Janus, you KNOW just how good she is.<br>
<br>
Chewie, Protector is the best Chewbacca out there now.	I was amazed at how good he ends up being, He can cancel plenty of guys game text vs Scum, especially the original Evazan.  Dengar and Boelo come to mind too.	?3 deploy to Leia?  That?ll give him a spot in any of my mains decks.  Smuggler?  He?s going into Watch your Step.<br>
<br>
Corran is just another utility character for the Light Side.  He fits in almost every deck but WYS.  He?s got a lot going for him, but nothing earth shattering.<br>
<br>
Dash on his ship is DA BOMB.  Give him a copilot (Not leebo, he doesn?t add power!) and you definitely got some advantage going on in space, -8 power to them.	Bring out Zuckuss, see if I care.  Bossk in Bus?  Power = 0.  Ouch.<br>
<br>
The Light Side also got more far reaching combo cards.	Control &amp; Tunnel Vision?  Hell yeah!  They just took that Tunnel Vision that fits in so many decks just gave it some more uses.  Bith Shuffle &amp; Desperate Reach, here?s an easy recylable five that was already used some, and now it cancels Imperial Barrier.  There?s nothing pissier than a barrier from my point of view.	That?s a staple.  Out of commission &amp; Transmission Terminated?  A way to fit TT into your deck, since OOC should already be in there.  Sorry about the Mess &amp; Blaster Proficiency is also definitely worth the card slot.  Owen Lars &amp; Beru Lars, much like Corran, gives the LS another character worth fitting in when you don?t know what else to put in.<br>
To sum up combo cards, that makes five that will fit in most decks, I?d say about 80% of mine.<br>
<br>
In Summary, the Light Side got more far reaching cards that will help ANY deck, but much like the dark side, none of these decks will get that much better/worse (Except for those that rely on SAC).  Watch Your Step will be seeing some play time, and expect tracking to be an even BIGGER part of light side strategy now.  We got some new toys with some cool new abilities, meaning the various characters.<br>
Dark side, on the other hand, feels much like it didn?t get anything new at all.  We have a guy that captures?	We had that.  We have a big powerhouse?  We had that.  Opponent draws no more than one destiny?  Yeah we?ve had that.  Add Destiny in space?  I?ve seen that before.<br>
<br>
So who really got the shaft here?<br>
