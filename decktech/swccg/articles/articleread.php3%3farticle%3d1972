It deals with an important aspect of the game in a clear, reasoned way. I suppose I must get my 2 cents in:<br>
If a card says &quot;do&quot; something or increases the cost to do something, then that becomes part of the rules of the game. There is no valid excuse for deliberately failing to do it. I think that it is important to have the skill to monitor and enforce the cards you deploy because you can not depend on your opponent to do it. It is not your responsibility in a moral sense. Both players should follow the rules and if there is a card on the table that says &quot;add 2 to the deploy cost of card x,&quot; then failing to add 2 is no different than trying to deploy Lord Vader for 4 force. However, there are often so many cards in play that it is difficult for a player to keep track. So it is reasonable that someone could miss something. If you have a greater awareness of all the forces in play at any given time, you have an advantage. There is no need to heighten the advantage by &quot;forgetting&quot; to do things.<br>
I think many players have succumbed to temptation on occasion. That is not good but it is forgivable. Sometimes the competetive instinct gets the better of a person. What I find less palatable is making the decision to ignore the rules before the game even starts.<br>
Anyway, great article on an important topic. Thanks.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=29">rayc</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">cheaters suck. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=1712">GG BLADE</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Let&#146;s hope all of those cheating jerks out there listen to this article. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=4659">Prince Xizor</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Good article. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=4459">Adrenaline</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Steve,  the game I played against you in game 6 of Y4 regional this past year still ranks as one of the best games I&#146;ve ever played.  As for the article, it was very well thought out and terribly lucid(two qualities often lacking in articles around this place).  I agree with many of your points, and I do find it to be a very fine line to tread.  I often find myself reminding my opponent about his Visage when it hurts him as much as me.  This is an issue that is going to be even more poigniant as the pro tour looms on the horizon.  What are the organizers going to say on the issues?  I hope they have a tidy solution. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=166">FridayKnight</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Very nice, I like  what you say about &quot;your card=your responsiblity&quot; along with don&#146;t be an idiot too much, you&#146;ll just be thought of as a cheater. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=6">jpvz</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">excellent arguments, all very sound.<br>

I remember when I first started the only one of my friends that played star wars was a big cheater. Since he was the only person that I played and I didn&#146;t really know most of the rules (SW is such a complicated game) he was able to slaughter me every time we played. I remember one time he put Tarkin with some guy that had Vader&#146;s cape at a site and said he could cancel my destiny and since he was so much better than me I thought he should know the rules.<br>
<br>
Anyway I agree with everything you said here except maybe a couple things about not having to do certain cards unless he reminds you. I agree that it is his resposibility to remind you but it isn&#146;t exactly sportsmanlike to do something like that (especially in the case of Visage or Battle Plan/Order) I do agree with you I guess that it is not cheating unless he reminds you and you still don&#146;t do it but it is still more sportsmanlike to remind him of the cards even if it hurts you. But something that follows from that is people do really forget (believe me I I am the king of forgettfulness) so don&#146;t automaticly think they are cheating if they forget even several times a game as sometimes, especially if the game is very intense, they could be concentrating on other things so always remind them. Anyway this is probably the longest review I&#146;ve ever written so I better end it here. Again excellant article I think everyone who plays the game of Star Wars should read this. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=1863">GenThrawn</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">great article </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=2003">Raglov</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">good article, and i agree </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=2515">craigers186</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">awesome article steven. i agree with everything you said.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=1183">arthur</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">BEUTIFUL!!!!!! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=2576">CmdCorranH</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Damn.

I feel that automatic actions (ie. Visage) should be ruled that they MUST happen no matter if the players &quot;forget&quot; or not, but I&#146;ve seen it go both ways. In essence, if you cheat like in any other competitive event you must ask yourself one question, would I truely be the best if I cheated in order to achieve X accolade? I would not enjoy to see SW become like other CCGs (ex. Magic) in which High Level tournament play included purposeful cheating in nearly every tournament game. This article changed the way I will take responsiblity for the cards I play and respect those my opponents play. Impressive, Most impressive.

Winning Worlds gives you nothing other than respect and pride for your accomplishment, and while some people would cheat for it, most would think that if you cheat your way to the final confrontation, its no longer worth anything. However, introduce money as a prize, and regardless of what you do to win, the prize remains untainted and unchanged. A cash prize truly would draw people to cheating because they would be playing for cash, not to prove themselves better than the competition, hence anything to give them an edge would be greatly sought. And I don&#146;t want to spend the entire game watching my opponents every move or lack there-of and recounting all his power totals. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=2172">Rogue Dealer</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">very nice article </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=1613">rugman11</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Nicely put together article on how to be competitive and yet still maintain a level of consideration for other players.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=808">MattJ</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Nice.

In some tournaments I have been to the TD administered a rule that alowed you to back up an action or 2 using your own discretion and his or hers.  I have often forgot to retrive one force with my Draw thier fire and usually it is no big deal but occasionaly they say falt out no even if it is one action later.  Lighten up.  I have found the the worst people are the upper ranked players.  Not all just some.  How did you get your rating so high?  Cheating out newbies cause they are drawn into an action so greatly they forget what one of their cards do?  When I play some of you guys I find that the game was alot funner when I did not know all the rules and backing was exceptable.

I agree with all your points.  To refute some of the reviews you have gotten, I quote: &quot;Articles are to be written to improve playing style, technique, and strategy.&quot;	Your article didn&#146;t improve my technique, and it sure didn&#146;t influence my strategy.  It did, however, greatly influence my playing style.  Where I play is in a small town where there are nothing but 4- and 5- man tournaments.  That&#146;s all we have, and we all play it because we love the game.  That&#146;s all.<br>
<br>
My next quote, &quot;This article changed an aspect of how I think about the game mechanics (should always be something dealing with the larger picture, not a specific card)&quot;  This article has everything to do with that quote.  Especially the &quot;larger picture&quot; part.  I agree with your points about my card/my responsibility.  More importantly, it helps to point out to your opponent (especially if that person is a beginner), &quot;You forgot to force drain here.&quot;  But only do it once, because after that, it&#146;s their fault if they forget.  This also applies to other beginner&#146;s mistakes that we all make (too numerous to mention).<br>
<br>
Most of all, the SW:CCG field has many members, ranging from very young to adulthood.  It is important to remember the basics of a game: it&#146;s all for fun, nothing more.  Sure, it&#146;s no fun to lose a tournament, but it&#146;s meant to be a learning experience.  How did I lose?  How could my deck be better?  What was the deciding factor of my defeat?  These things keep us coming back for more. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=3301">BreakWindu71</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Steve you took a lot of time to write a well thought out article.

With that in mind, here are my comments and thoughts. Firstly, don&#146;t take responsibility for an opponent&#146;s card. Even if it&#146;s on your side of the table. That applies unless you&#146;re playing a newbie in a local, in which case remind them to remind you (this helps to teach them the game, which is important for us all - you should be winning this game anyway).  The other time you should remember is during friendlies and playtesting, when it&#146;s important to know the strength of your deck when the pressure is really on. <BR> <BR> However, I&#146;d take this rule further at the top level. If you&#146;re playing with the rest of the big boys then provided you aren&#146;t (a) making a complete arse of yourself (you need to judge this or else the TD will), or (b) breaking the fundamental rules of the game, then it&#146;s perfectly acceptable to make the opponent remind you every time for YOUR visage, YOUR Bring Him Before Me or the loss of 1 force to a 3 point drain with HB. <BR> <BR> Star Wars is played out between two minds and the luck factor is shifting increasingly from card draws and destiny (which can detract from every player&#146;s performance no matter what their skill) to deck matchups. Once you&#146;re paired and you&#146;re playing for the big prize, you should punish your opponent for every mistake he makes. Whether that&#146;s taking advantage of his omission to leave a force for barrier, successfully bluffing a monnok to stop him drawing the winning cards or just moving Leia away when she&#146;s been Beaten and he didn&#146;t stop you (controversial that one...I don&#146;t know). <BR> <BR> Here&#146;s an example from worlds this year. Dom Gaudreault made a crucial move in DBay transit of the Emperor to a location I occupied. I noticed on his next turn this was not allowed. I hadn&#146;t been concentrating on his moves, it was too late to rectify it and he won the game, fair and square. Whether he did that intentionally or not is moot. I&#146;m not going to bear any malice. Text like that and battle plan is something you might take note of at the bottom, but try to ignore at the top. On the reverse side, dropping cards onto your reserve deck, retreiving cards without cause, overactivation, whatever...that sort of stuff is out of line. Card text is one thing, playing by the rules is quite another. <BR> <BR> There are some ideas anyway, a bit jumbled I know. If you want to talk about this more, dmail. SW:CCG play theories and ideas are a favourite topic of mine. Cheers. Alex Tennet. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=327">Greedo</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">best article on decktech......and i agree with everything you said </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=931">Crusher</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">although the description listed for 5 stars (this article changed an aspect of how I think about the game mechanics) certainly does NOT apply, this is still about as good as articles on decktech EVER GET, so I will give you the 5.

This is what we need more of in this game. A reminder: &quot;Hey, its just a game!&quot; I admit I used to forget things at key moments, but almost never in tournament play. I have a 1558 rating (or maybe it went up after last tournament....) and I could care less what happens to it. A few tournaments ago, a fellow player &quot;melded&quot; his Force pile and hand, to give him a few extra Force to deploy his pitiful aliens in his long worked on, PoS CotVG deck (which I built better in 25 minutes what took him 1 year). This is blatant cheating. All of us may or may not admit it, but we have once or twice. But as you pointed out, there is &quot;honest&quot; cheating, where you forget. One thing you failed to point out is, NEVER, EVER under ANY circumstances, should you point out something that is going on in another game. At the last tournament I went to, a HD&DtJ deck played against a MWYHL deck. With 5 minutes left, the HD OBJ was not flipped when Ben was at the Cantina. This is because the HD player honestly forgot about Ben, and did not flip. He would&#146;ve won the game by 1 Force, but the MWYHL player realized this at the last second and won by 1.

I lost a very close game (1 Force) because my opponent took my Back Door at the end of the previous game. I would have probably won if my opponent hadn&#146;t grabbed my card, and my deck came with 60 cards...<BR><br>
I think any blatant cheating is automatic disqualification for a tourney. However, I give Decipher some of the blame for marked cards. My mint foils are all marked, due to bending. Not cool. I don&#146;t know if opaque sleeves will make it harder or easier to cheat, but they might be a good idea. <BR><br>
I agree that after a few times, the reminders get old. Probably the best strategy is to make the opponent announce each of their phases, even if nothing happens during them. During a close game, my opponent kept &quot;forgetting&quot; to announce the end of his deploy phase, his duty, so that he could lose to my objective. Phase announcing might sound annoying, but it makes it easy to keep track of what is going on. It strikes the balance, the secret to tolerance. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=4454">blackgecko</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Sorry, nothing constructive to say, other than that this was a well thought out, well constructed, and well writen artical that not only deals with a very important topic in our field and gives guidelines on how to combat this problem, but it also gives us an insight into the mind of one of the top players in our game.

<br>
You get 5 stars for an exhaustive and honest approach to an<br>
important subject, but if everyone was to follow your first<br>
two guidelines, the game would fall into a sorry state. By<br>
saying so firmly, &quot;You be responsible for your cards, and<br>
I&#146;ll be responsible for mine,&quot; you may find a fair way of<br>
dealing with a situation--but what situation? You encourage<br>
the contest over the game, meaning it becomes all about<br>
winning--not fun. Your first two guidelines seem to permit<br>
people to intentionally &quot;forget&quot; cards, and that&#146;s just<br>
wrong. Even if there&#146;s no fair way to judge it. It&#146;s just a<br>
sickening habit--intentionally forgetting. I go to tournies<br>
for fun. So do many people. And when I&#146;ve played people who<br>
intentionally &quot;forget,&quot; it ruins an hour of my life. That&#146;s<br>
an hour wasted. That&#146;s not the experience I desire from<br>
cards. If winning means that much to you, you&#146;ve lost focus<br>
about what the game is. It&#146;s no longer a game; it&#146;s the<br>
flexing of your ego. What&#146;s better? Play as fair and<br>
honorably as possible. Expect your opponent to play the<br>
same. The only &quot;forgotten&quot; cards that are okay are the ones<br>
that are honestly forgotten. Really, when it comes down to<br>
it, wouldn&#146;t any sporting player rather feel the<br>
satisfaction of winning a game through deck design, tactics<br>
and luck rather than by knowing &quot;I bought myself 5 force by<br>
intentionally &#146;forgetting&#146;?&quot; Think about that.<br>

My opinion is signicantly similar except I think that improving your brain to observe all aspects of the game and all the cards on the table should be a learned skill that people should approve upon just like deck building or even tracking.  In other words, the elite player has a sound, solid deck, has all the necessary skills (i.e. tracking) AND knows all the rules and texts by heart.	So, saving blatant contradictions to the rules, the enforcement of the rules regarding your cards (and to a certain extent-thier cards) should be done by you, as the pro-player.  Players should strive to knowing AND enforcing all the rules, as well as playing all thier cards perfectly.

I lost a game just last week because I never noticed my opponent losing to his used pile. A few of my friends whose games were done did notice, but were unable to say anything to anyone because of the whole interference thing. One thing I do believe is fair is allowing your opponent to think something is a certain way until the situation arises. to explain that, let me give you this. My opponent had hidden base out, and I threw security precautions down. He read the card to check, and I told him exactly what it did, as worded on the card. I did not, however, tell him that Battle damage didn&#146;t cover attrition or weapons. Had he battled, Or I battled, I would have lost to such things, but he never did, partially because he didn&#146;t clarify what battle damage was. Had he asked to clarify what exactly was battle damage, I would gladly have told him, but I wasn&#146;t about to say anything until it came up. It would almost be like reminding your opponent at the beginning of his control phase to force drain you, or reminding him about it all. Or reminding your opponent that everything at the adjacent sites can react to help your poor, helpless rebel trooper that has the word &quot;bait&quot; written on his back. Until it comes up, why warn them? I thought hard in this one, and I can&#146;t see that as cheating. But I digress. I wholeheartedly agree with your article.

&lt;P&gt;<br>
the game consists of you playing cards and following what the text says on them... as soon as you start intentionally not following the cards on the table (whether theyre yours or not), you are comprimising the integrity of the game and cheating... period... i dont see why freebies are justified just because whoever youre playing might not be callous enough to ASSUME that you will intentionally forget to play fairly... especially on the pro tour level.. if you are intentionally forgetting cards like visage, etc, you are simply cheating, whether you can live with that label or not.<br>
&lt;P&gt;<br>
i also agree with kirk that it seems to be a fitting rule for playing with friends, but a poor standard for tournament play... there shouldnt be a grey little line.. it should be warning, DQ... <br>

It&#146;s the same with distracting your opponent; it has nothing to do with the type of deck you are playing with or against, or the skill of your opponent or yourself, or your or your opponent&#146;s starting hand; therefore, it has no place in the game. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=1859">admiralpiett</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">cool </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=5298">Jawa Lord</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a5.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I agree with you and I think that, It should have special rules against cheaters such as : if someone is seen to be cheating more than 2 times in a tournament (such deploying with lesser cost or activating more than he should, etc.) should be immediatly discalified.

Here&#146;s a question for you though: What if you count your opponent&#146;s deck and he&#146;s got 58? I&#146;ve had that happen before at a local and I knew the guy, so I told him; turns out he just left his Boussh and TK422 with his last opponent. In fact, every time my opponent has had more or less than 60 I&#146;ve told him, but it certainly is tempting to go into the game with a couple points advantage.<br>
I&#146;m not sure if it&#146;s cheating to not tell him if he has less than 60 ... it&#146;s not that hard to count to 60 after all. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=400">Voice of Law</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a4.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I love you Steve </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><A HREF="/swccg/membercenter/directory/memberpage.php3?member=1351">Jedi Taboos</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/a4.gif" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I agree, if a player &quot;forgets&quot; his own card&#146;s function to his benefit, it is cheating.

At level two, I don&#146;t get a caution, then a warning, then a game loss.<br>
