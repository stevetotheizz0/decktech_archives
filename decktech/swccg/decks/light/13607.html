<p>Okay, I&#8217;ve been looking over the reviews. Quite frankly, some of you are utter morons. A few of the prize winners:<br>
<br>
<p><b>ONE-ARM:</b> First of all, allow me to say that I am deeply offended by your sad devotion to capital letters. Furthermore, why would I get a -1 star review from you, merely because I put an idiot in his place? Isn&#146;t this a &#146;deck review&#146;? Did I put this deck on here for you to judge me based on my character? No, it is actually that I put this deck on here to get people like you to review my deck, so I can spend a few minutes chewing you out and giving me support to my own overinflated sense of superiority. I mean, really, why wouldn&#146;t I &#146;diss&#146; Stormcrow? Stupid people are not my responsibility.<br>
<br>
<p><b>Adreneline:</b> WTF? Why would I play Electrobinocs in this deck? If you can&#8217;t figure out where your Insertion Planning is after you play it, that is not my problem. Notice the inclusion of several destiny 5/6 cards that can be easily recycled around. The binocs are for amateurs or decks that need early precision tracking (i.e. rigging an Alter draw on S&D in the old Test 2 decks).<br>
<br>
<p><b>Solo337:</b> While you are noticably a good player, you also ignore some rather obvious facts. Firstly, they can&#8217;t duel jack if I don&#8217;t want them to. Obi doesn&#8217;t have to drop down against Hunt Down if I suspect a duel, the Visage damage is only 2 a turn. Luke is instantly captured, and basically from there I can operate without Jedi, seeing as Leia is solely a defensive option in the deck. So Vader can kill a bunch of scouts. Obviously, you took no time to read the strategy. I can&#8217;t believe I wasted this much time typing a response to you.<br>
<br>
<p><b>Sledder:</b>Home One w/o Haashn can drop for a few turns and win a fight or two for you in space, at the least. Sorry I couldn&#8217;t convince you.<br>
<br>
<p><b>Nexus:</b>Actually, you make a couple of good points. It&#8217;s A Trap will be considered. And your point about DODN/WA is noted, and that is part of the reason why it didn&#8217;t make it in. If you try this sort of deck, you&#8217;ll find that these 3 effects are by far the most important, the vast majority of the time.<br>
<br>
<p><b>Stormcrow:</b>MORE DESTINY? ARE YOU (Nasty word, removed by author due to inept Decktech censors)ING STUPID? WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TOSS IN 10 INTRUDER MISSLES FOR 10 CHARACTERS? Even Lewis is smarter than this.<br>
<br>
<p><b>IceHot:</b>Your comments are appreciated, Wuta might go in with another site and Midge if the comments for more drain potential are pronounced. <br>
<br>
<p><b>JEEBS:</b>Yes, try to duel. It just won&#8217;t happen unless I mess up and give you that chance. And you might just lose anyway. Go read the goddamn objective if you aren&#8217;t aware of what it says.<br>
<br>
<p><b>Luca/Tzizvvt:</b>The defense is appreciated, and it&#8217;s obvious from your comments that you read through the strategy section. I don&#8217;t ask for more than that before reviewing, and yet still, we have the utterly moronic Stormcrow, who from what I gleamed from his review, thought he was logging onto some Pokemon site and had absolutely no idea what the cards in the deck even do. Not that I hold that against you, Stormcrow, but you have no idea just how much I&#8217;ve laughed at that review. <br>
<br>
<p>Of course, the one card I noticed that I forgot was something that no one has brought up . . .that destiny-killin&#8217; fool, Kal&#8217;Falnl C&#8217;ndros! <br>
<br>
<p>Keep bringin&#8217; it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><align=CENTER>END UPDATE</a><br><br>
A bunch of dudes in my area have been fooling around with that silly There Is Good In Him deck using scouts and interrupts to win battles, turn Vader, etc. If they fight in space, then use Strike Planning to pull Calrissian, use Calrissian to pull GS1, go fight them and win battles up there. It would seem to me that if you&#8217;re going to play any space in TIGIH, it should be the dominant theme of the deck, but regardless, what about the scouts?<br>
<br>
If you don&#8217;t know how to play this deck, here&#8217;s a quick idea: ALWAYS start Insurrection, Staging Areas, Strike Planning. Always drop a dude to Home One DB 1st turn, move Luke over. Generate a ton of Force, go beat them up with your massive destiny and your characters. Never leave less than 3 characters at a site at a time if you expect an immediate counterattack. Don&#8217;t attack with less than what you are going to need---this is key. <br>
<br>
I thought about the key weaknesses of the There Is Good In Him scout variant. First and foremost to me was the threat of Darth Vader, DLOTS. This guy with a saber absolutely wrecks the low ability scout force with his choke ability. If they put Lord Vader out, it&#8217;s a blessing. The easy counter to DLOTS is Boussh. If they put DLOTS down, all you&#8217;ve gotta do is put down Boussh and you&#8217;ve isolated the key threat. <br>
<br>
The second problem I noticed was in the deck&#8217;s lasting power. If this deck has to win by conversion, I&#8217;ve noticed that the differential is usual pretty low. The addition of On/Off The Edge just makes sense, seeing as you&#8217;re playing a ton of high destiny anyway. This will allow you some comfort room.<br>
<br>
I really didn&#8217;t want to use up the slots that going to space hardcore requires, and this deck would do it in a pretty half-assed manner if Zuckuss hit the board. The question was between Landing Claws and starfighters or Home One. I decided that a space deck typically has plenty of methods these days to eliminate the Claw, which would be a game-ending move more often than not. <br>
<br>
Staging Areas is so mad powerful in this deck, your activation should go quickly to insane levels. I know there&#8217;s no place in the deck to put the spaceport docking bay, but consider that it will be easy to deploy it related to a system or site your opponent deploys. <br>
<br>
I&#8217;m aware that there&#8217;s no S/A protection. This is a meta choice. If I were going to a big tournament with this thing, WA/DODN would go in, problem is solved. They could never afford to Sense everything, and you&#8217;d be able to wear them out.<br>
<br>
Deck strategies:<br>
<br>
Hardcore Space: Deploy your DBs, start pinging. Activate huge Force with Staging Areas, Tunnel Vision for Corran Horn when possible and break the cover of any UC spies. Retrieve Force through your Interrupts and send Home One to space. You probably lose, but keep fighting &#8217;em. I don&#8217;t really care, this deck is a meta evolution in the first place. If I wanted to beat space, you&#8217;d see a different deck.<br>
<br>
BHBM: You can spirit Vader away to the Throne Room instantly, let them duel if they want, it&#8217;s not your problem if they want to make it an auto-win. Attack their guys in force, use your retrieval to your advantage, and wear them out. They will almost certainly drop the Emperor 1st turn to your DB, so if they see no Vaders early, you make &#8217;em lose a ton of Force to the two objectives.<br>
<br>
Hunt Down: Let them deploy stuff. You&#8217;ll see Vader before anything else, I&#8217;m guessing. If it&#8217;s DLOTS, find Boussh and use her to remove the threat of him. Any other Vader, feel free to attack. Go stack cards, conversion is a definite possibility here.<br>
<br>
Court/Scum: If you suspect they&#8217;ve got Jade, don&#8217;t move Luke away from the Endor DB. Put guys out onto Tatooine at the Pit Of Carkoon or Tatooine: JP if it&#8217;s out, nullify that Court damage. Use your massive activation edge to set up fast and you can offset their retrieval. Generally, the easiest of the Scum matchups, you&#8217;ll see why.<br>
<br>
MKOS or SYCFA/Scum (the popular Scum): Use your Spaceport Docking Bay here to move onto Jabba&#8217;s Palace, use your Fallen Portals and high destiny to cause massive character loss for your opponent. Make them stack cards and use OOC to reduce the number of cards that can be retrieved. You will probably have to think about Jade in SYCFA Scum, MKOS probably not (seeing as most people don&#8217;t know Arica is an incredible character for this deck). Feel free to move Luke onto Tatooine against MKOS and have him take an active role in holding JP. Be wary of Iggy, but remember that Fallen Portal can easily take out two characters in a fight, making your job much easier. The retrieval keeps you going in a close game. I wouldn&#8217;t invade the AC, that&#8217;s going outside your zone of safety. <br>
<br>
Rops: Actually, a fairly easy matchup for you. Right at the very beginning of the game, you put pressure on them to go pick up Luke and lose Force. Drop guys onto anybody who escorts Luke, establish a good generation base. Jump onto Ralltiir, you might get a chance to convert Vader in this one so be looking for good opportunities to win a fight. If they set up at 1/0 DBs, drop one of your million spies there to fight them with backup. The biker version is tough, but liberal use of Insertion Planning can be a huge tactical advantage here. If you are really worried, throw in Ounee Ta, but I just don&#8217;t see Rops being a huge threat, even if you&#8217;ve got to play it.<br>
<br>
Agents Of Black Sun: Sadly, you don&#8217;t have a prayer of turning Vader in this one. If the Emperor shows up to capture Luke, be thankful for the direct damage as it can help a LOT against Black Sun. Go kill his stuff anyway if you&#8217;ve got the chance, if he&#8217;s stupid enough to attack in small numbers with this deck you&#8217;ll win easily. Start the Jedi Knight in this game, the extra immunity is nice and +2 power comes in handy when Snoova shows up. Xizor will almost certainly have tons of backup around him, so Boussh could come in real handy. Keep the majority of fights to DBs if possible, Fallen Portal rocks the house against AoBS, and your two priority targets are Dengar w/gun and Xizor. If you know what your destiny is going to be, FP can take out two guys per fight easily. <br>
<br>
Whatever I&#8217;m missing, sorry. Just note it to me in a review or a D-Mail, I&#8217;ll update.
