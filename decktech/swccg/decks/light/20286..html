Starships/Vehicles:<br>
<br>
Trade Federation Droid Control Ship <br>

Used by Jango Fett and young Boba Fett.<br>
<br>

<br>
Geonosian Speeder <br>

<br>
Naboo Royal Starship <br>

<br>
Facts About Episode II:<br>
<br>
These are some questions asked to Rick McCallum and here&#146;s the answers:<br>
<br>
Will we meet a young Luke? <br>
<br>
No. You&#146;ll see him be born. But there the story ends and goes to episodes 4, 5, and 6.<br>
<br>
<br>
Why did Qui-Gon Jinn not disappear like the other Jedis do when they die? <br>
<br>
The Qui-Gon Jinn thing you will discover as time goes on. There is a whole issue around that and the ability to disappear. The key line to understanding this is when Ben Kenobi tells Darth Vader, &quot;If you try to strike me down, I will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.&quot; Hey, he&#146;s with a fan magazine. What do I know about these things? So, that&#146;s a key line. And it&#146;ll be explained as we go along. The other issue is that I have very specific projects. I have TV shows; I have movies. I have a whole line of them. I don&#146;t know which one I&#146;m going to start with when I finish these because it&#146;s five years from now. I don&#146;t know where my head will be. I know I&#146;ve got a lot of them sitting on the shelf. Some of them I&#146;m very anxious to get working on, but we&#146;ll see when I get there.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Episode 1 Qui-Gon Jinn said Anakin would bring balance to The Force. What does that mean? <br>
<br>
Let me explain briefly. If good and evil are mixed things become blurred - there is nothing between good and evil, everything is grey. In each of us we have balance these emotions, and in the Star Wars saga the most important point is balance, balance between everything. It is dangerous to lose this. In The Phantom Menace one of the Jedi Council already knows the balance of The Force is starting to slip, and will slip further. It is obvious to this person that The Sith are going to destroy this balance. On the other hand a prediction which is referred to states someone will replace the balance in the future. At the right time a balance may again be created, but presently it is being eroded by dark forces. All of this shall be explained in Episode 2, so I can&#146;t say any more! <br>
<br>
<br>
When I think that Anakin will become Darth Vader, I feel it is better he not be trained as a Jedi - has Qui-Gon Jinn made a mistake? <br>
<br>
I think it is obvious that he was wrong in Episode 1 and made a dangerous decision, but ultimately this decision may be correct. The Phantom Menace refers to the force of the dark side of the Universe. Anakin will be taken over by dark forces which in turn destroy the balance of the Galaxy, but the individual who kills the Emperor is Darth Vader - also Anakin. The tale meanders and both the prediction, and Qui-Gon are correct - Anakin is the chosen one, and he did bring peace at last with his own sacrifice. Luke couldn&#146;t kill the Emperor himself, but he could make Anakin reflect on his life and kill the Emperor.<br>
