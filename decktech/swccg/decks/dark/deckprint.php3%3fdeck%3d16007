Ok. This deck is currently 28-3 in tournament play. The activation is great. Here is how to use it: You앏l always start Mob. Points. I prefer using First Strike and Crush (grab Monnok) as other effects against almost any deck. <br>
<br>
First turn: Pull Carida, activate and get D*: War Room (if it압 not there get D*: DCR 327). If you have Brangus in hand deploy him there. Same goes if Dr.E is there (and no Brangus). Get that Endor:DB and CC :DB, but only against space decks. Against mains, check what DB압 they play. (You can use those dockings to retrieve w Brangus).If Emperor is in hand, deploy him to DB. Second Turn: if the first turn didn앖 go as it압 supposed to do, try doing this now then. <br>
Third Turn: the rest is battling. If you face odds, just deploy Emperor, Janus and Brangus (if he압 in space, which I앇 guess he is...) and try and battle him out w your ships. <br>
<br>
In my area, Grimtaash and SAC are extremely uncommon among LS decks, so drawing a lot of cards the first turns is a good idea. Once Emperor and Janus are together, start using the machine by searching for the Force Lightning, and then put it down w Janus. By doing this, you앏l always be able to see what압 in your deck and you앏l always have a card to put down w Janus. <br>
<br>
Some card explanations: <br>
Why the D*:DCR327? I am planning on adding an Elis Helrot. And besides, you can start w another effect (instead of IAO) and still get your DB압. <br>
<br>
Arica - if you really need to block a drain, and can앖 battle him there, she might help. Good against the new WYS beatdown, they앏l try to lure you to Tatooine due to the drain for 2 at cantina, but you can ignore them w Arica.<br>
<br>
Gravity Shadow - great for killing ships that try to make kessel runs or OMDH. track your destiny (w janus perhaps?), kill the ship, then take it back w Brangus and repeat it... Or apply a beatdown on a single ship.<br>
<br>
Crush - beat WYS, mains and stuff via pulling Monnok, cancel clash and reduce their battle destinies at CC:DB.<br>
<br>
One Alter - good against WYS if they don앖 flip before deploying beggar (sometimes they won앖). <br>
<br>
I앇 Just As Soon As Kiss A Wookie - for Beggar and also for anything mean that would like to enter play.<br>
<br>
no grabbers - i앇 love to add one, but there are no cards to remove...<br>
<br>
How to beat certain decks: <br>
<br>
HB space: Get a drain for three at the Endor:DB or CC: DB (vader +stivck, emperor + janus, mara +stick) as soon as possible. Battle w your ships (you앏l have to draw quite a lot to get some ships...) and the lateral damage is a killer here. Never battle unless you know you앏l profit something from it. brangus is key to winning, eg. take your ships and the lateral back. Gravity Shadow, Lateral, Ghhk/TRWEU and such are winners.<br>
<br>
HB mains: Tough game. Use dr.e and Lord Vader w lightsaber (not built-in, added...), You Are Beaten, Set For Stun and Sniper to reduce his army and try to beatdown him. <br>
I았e made my opponent lose 21 cards at a location where he from the beginning had 5 mains. youre beaten, sniper, dr.+operate, boba+hidden weapons and Han was left alone (I add one destiny w Boba... sweeeeet.). Boba is no longer in this deck due to his lack of ability.. battle smart and you앏l win. <br>
<br>
TIGIH: <br>
I았e met this deck once and won easily. TIGIH loses Luke against non-BHBM decks, which is bad. That makes me control ground. <br>
<br>
WYS space: take control of his sites. watch out for the cantina brawl. use lateral and ships wisely to kill his key-cards (eg. falcon and outrider). rather tough game, but should be won. i앐 5-1 in non-sanctioned play against WYS. Use Gravity Shadow often. Broken Concentration works good here, you앏l activate lots of more than he does. <br>
<br>
WYS ground: If it압 not the beatdown version, I don앖 think they can stand a chance against all my battle interrupts. If it압 beatdown, then you must play extremely careful. Deploy all characters at D*: DB and when you have 5 or 6 characters move them to Endor: DB (not Tatooine). Arica stops the drain at Cantina, the space fleet is rather big and lateral is huge against Dash. You MUST initiate most of the battles or you WILL lose the game. The worst matchup. IJASAKAW can stop Beggar as can Alter (if youre lucky...).<br>
<br>
AITC: <br>
uncommon deck. haven앖 seen one in ages. use control to cancel sandwhirl and beat the hell out of him. <br>
<br>
Yavin4 mains: Same as HB mains. battle as mad, interrupts will win this game. <br>
<br>
EBO - Blast Door Controls wins this game for me. no barriers and I can battle as I like. by starting first strike, he앏l have a hard time playing any interrupts. the new ghhk is great too against reacts and Hyper Escape (and Closer! if youre facing asteroids). Gravity Shadow is a killer.<br>
<br>
and now, give me some CONSTRUCTIVE reviews please. not one of those 1-stars telling &quot;you suck&quot; or &quot;what?&quot;.  (last time I submitted this deck some guy told me that I needed an undercover for Arica....).<br>
