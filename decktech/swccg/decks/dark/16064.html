I did not copy either Dark Surgeon or Grace&#8217;s Vengeance since my deck is different then both of them. I took the best of both decks and eliminated, what I felt, were weakness&#8217; to create my deck (BTW this deck is more like Grace&#8217;s then DS). Thanks.<br>
___________________________________________________________-<br>
<b> Responces</b><br>
<b>Artoo-Detoo & Thunder </b> - What? This deck activates force like there is no tommorow. What do you think mob points is for? I activate tons of force as well as choking my opponent.<br>
<b> kmcnash</b> - Dude no deck today can be original. All the best decks are taken. Of coarse you can&#8217;t just re-post a deck already posted but you can use it as a template for a whole new deck. This is what I did since my deck is way different the Dark Surgeon (manip instead of big choke). <br>
<br>
Also I know Tatooine will probably end up hurting my deck a lot. But it&#8217;s not out yet so please no tat related stuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Okay here is my current AOTBS deck, which has played magnificently so far. My deck is a cross between Dark Surgeon*s and Grace*s Vengeance. While I really liked the character selection of Dark Surgeon and most of its game play style, I found myself wanting to make the deck with a trace of manip instead of force choke. <br>
After seeing Grace*s Vengeance I had a great template for the manip style I wanted. But I did not like the character choices in Grace*s deck nearly as much as Dark Surgeon (the most was Grace only played with 2 palpy). So I combined the decks making this.<br>
   By now most of you should know how to play Black Sun so I won*t go into to much detail. Basically you want to get Palpy out to a battleground site with Force Lightning & I have you Know to protect him (you will find that your opponent almost always leaves Palpy alone since he, and his interrupts, make a 1-man army). Also get Xizor W/support (best is Guri) to another battleground site to flip (move him to Coruscant DB first turn and then get him to a battleground by moving or Presence of the Force). Vigos can help bigtime with the added drain bonus and the direct damage from the objective is nasty. You can easily get your opponent losing 6-9 per turn. If Luke never hits the table you will win almost all the time. But since he normally does I have plenty of cards to kill him. Normally I flip before Luke comes down so I am allowed 1-2 turns to set up some high destiny(s) to track (this is done by placing a card from your hand into your used pile to look at force pile). Then just capture/kill Luke with Hidden Weapons (track a Palpy to kill him or ADT to capture), Snoova, IG-88, shoot him (easy with tracked destiny). I really have not had a hard time killing Luke in any game I have played. <br>
<br>
    While I may not have the force choke ability that Dark Surgeon has (Bad Feeling/Battle Order/Secret Plans) I like the manip WAY better (have played with or against both and find the manip much better). The reason for this is that you have almost an auto win vs any swarm as well as being able to beat WYS beatdown easy (very popular right now) and being able to control the temp of the game. <br>
   This deck is full of tech and can only be used by an experienced player that know how to track and when to play cards at the right time. If you play right this deck is a monster.<br>
<br>
Now for deck match-ups:<br>
<br>
<b>VS WYS beat:</b> The most prevalent of lightside decks at this point in time is a sinch to beat if you play right. <br>
First off deploy Palpy to cantina and always keep Xizor on the Death Star (Crush the Rebellion) or with Guri. Your direct damage, along with Presence of the Force/Vigo enhanced drains, will finish off your opponent in no time if they do not deploy. Now here is where manip really pays off. Using ADT keep their Controls/TV down at the bottom of their force pile so that they are forced to draw a lot for them. Any smart player will not draw a ton since they will know you have placed their doubles together and will lose them to a monnok if they draw it all. If they are dumb and draw it all then just monnok them and game over. WYS beat relies on getting all of their cards in their hand (maybe 1 in the lost pile but most of the cards must be in their hand). Without their TV*s they will have to draw to get their cards, but they will not be able to draw much for fear of a lost monnok killing their Lukes/Hans. <br>
Whenever they get 13+ cards in their hand play monnok used to put them back at square 1. <b> If you play right there is NO WAY for them to get a big beatdown off against you.</b> If they decide to keep waiting to put Luke down you will finish them off with drains/D.damage and if they do put him down you will be able to cream him. If somehow they do get a beatdown crew to Palpy*s site (won*t be Xizor*s sinc he is protected by Guri/Crush) then just force lighting Han when he is deployed (keep a tracked destiny on top &#8211; very simple to do). I have beaten this deck VERY easily. <br>
<br>
<b> VS WYS Raiders</b> Can you say game over? Use ADT to put their raiders/crafts together and if they draw them then hit them with monnok lost. If they don&#8217;t draw for them then they are dead. Really no way to lose. <br>
<br>
<b> VS EBO</b> If it is swarm then it is pretty much like the WYS Raiders. Of course it will be a little harder since they will be able to drain in space with the little ships they get. A smart player will draw very carefully for fear of monnok. I have played a swarm before and just crushed it. The most X-Wings he got out was 4 and my ships just beat on him with tracked destinies as well as big drains/direct damage on the ground. Luke is easy to take care of and in this game you TOTALLY control. If they do start Yarna then keep their X-Wings at the bottom of the pile so that they have to draw over 13 cards to get them. Really would not be hard. If it is the Squad Assignments version then just drain/damage on the ground and pick your battles in space. I have found that X-Wings EBO is much better though so the Squad Assign shouldn&#8217;t be hard. <br>
<br>
<b>VS Hidden Mains</b> Yes this is the hardest matchup. I have not lost a game vs hidden mains but they have been the closest. Basically if you can make them deploy before they are set up with all their battle cards & OTE you will easily win (you get set up so fast). Hidden Weapons, Snoova, & IG are huge in this game since they are broken in a deck that tracks so easy. A tip is to keep their battling interrupts down in their force pile and use monnok wisely. If you play right and am able to capture/kill Luke you will win. <br>
<br>
<b> VS TIGIH scouts</b> Take your time to get set up and then go after Luke and battle him. It may take a while to get your capture cards in your hand since you are not flipped, but once you do you can normally kick butt. Just be patient and you can win easy. Sense is huge in this game (sense portal/barrier) so if this deck is popular in your region add 1-2 more. Once you kill Luke it&#146;s game over.<br>

Thanks for reviewing the deck. D-mail/AIM/e-mail any Q*s to me. Thanks<br>
