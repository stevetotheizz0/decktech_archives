                            If 9/11 was indeed the onset of World War III, we 
                            have to understand what this war is about. We're not 
                            fighting to eradicate "terrorism." Terrorism is just 
                            a tool. We're fighting to defeat an ideology: religious 
                            totalitarianism. World War II and the cold war were 
                            fought to defeat secular totalitarianism - Nazism 
                            and Communism - and World War III is a battle against 
                            religious totalitarianism, a view of the world that 
                            my faith must reign supreme and can be affirmed and 
                            held passionately only if all others are negated. 
                            That's bin Ladenism. But unlike Nazism, religious 
                            totalitarianism can't be fought by armies alone. It 
                            has to be fought in schools, mosques, churches and 
                            synagogues, and can be defeated only with the help 
                            of imams, rabbis and priests. </font>

                            The generals we need to fight this war are people 
                            like Rabbi David Hartman, from the Shalom Hartman 
                            Institute in Jerusalem. His contention is that unless 
                            Jews reinterpreted their faith in a way that embraced 
                            modernity, without weakening religious passion, and 
                            in a way that affirmed that God speaks multiple languages 
                            and is not exhausted by just one faith, they would 
                            have no future in the land of Israel. He knows where 
                            the battlefield was. He set up his own schools in 
                            Israel to compete with fundamentalist Jews, Muslims 
                            and Christians, who used their schools to preach exclusivist 
                            religious visions. </font>
                          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                            I e-mailed Rabbi Hartman and asked: How do we battle 
                            religious totalitarianism? He answered: "All faiths 
                            that come out of the biblical tradition - Judaism, 
                            Christianity and Islam - have the tendency to believe 
                            that they have the exclusive truth. When the Taliban 
                            wiped out the Buddhist statues, that's what they were 
                            saying. But others have said it too. The opposite 
                            of religious totalitarianism is an ideology of pluralism 
                            - an ideology that embraces religious diversity and 
                            the idea that my faith can be nurtured without claiming 
                            exclusive truth. America is the Mecca of that ideology, 
                            and that is what bin Laden hates and that is why America 
                            had to be destroyed." </font>
                          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                            The future of the world may well be decided by how 
                            we fight this war. Can Islam, Christianity and Judaism 
                            know that God speaks Arabic on Fridays, Hebrew on 
                            Saturdays and Latin on Sundays, and that he welcomes 
                            different human beings approaching him through their 
                            own history, out of their language and cultural heritage? 
                            "Is single-minded fanaticism a necessity for passion 
                            and religious survival, or can we have a multilingual 
                            view of God - a notion that God is not exhausted by 
                            just one religious path?" asked Rabbi Hartman. Many 
                            Jews and Christians have already argued that the answer 
                            to that question is yes, and some have gone back to 
                            their sacred texts to reinterpret their traditions 
                            to embrace modernity and pluralism, and to create 
                            space for secularism and alternative faiths. Others 
                            - Christian and Jewish fundamentalists - have rejected 
                            this notion, and that is what the battle is about 
                            within their faiths. </font>

                            What is different about Islam is that while there 
                            have been a few attempts at such a reformation, none 
                            have flowered or found the support of a Muslim state. 
                            We patronize Islam, and mislead ourselves, by repeating 
                            the mantra that Islam is a faith with no serious problems 
                            accepting the secular West, modernity and pluralism, 
                            and the only problem is a few bin Ladens. Although 
                            there is a deep moral impulse in Islam for justice, 
                            charity and compassion, Islam has not developed a 
                            dominant religious philosophy that allows equal recognition 
                            of alternative faith communities. Bin Laden reflects 
                            the most extreme version of that exclusivity, and 
                            he hit us in the face with it on 9/11. Christianity 
                            and Judaism struggled with this issue for centuries, 
                            but a similar internal struggle within Islam to re-examine 
                            its texts and articulate a path for how one can accept 
                            pluralism and modernity - and still be a passionate, 
                            devout Muslim - has not surfaced in any serious way. 
                            One hopes that now that the world spotlight has been 
                            put on this issue, mainstream Muslims too will realize 
                            that their future in this integrated, globalized world 
                            depends on their ability to reinterpret their past.

                            to be the kind of mind-set-shattering breakthrough 
                            for the Muslim world that has not been seen since

                            Why? Because for the first time since Sept. 11, a 
                            Muslim leader has dared to acknowledge publicly the 
                            real problem: that Muslim extremism has been rooted 
                            in the educational systems and ruling arrangements 
                            of many of their societies, and it has left much of 
                            the Muslim world in a backward state. But he also 
                            laid out a road map for doing something about it - 
                            not just throwing extremists in jail, but confronting 
                            their extremist ideas with modern schools and a progressive 
                            Islam. Ever since Sept. 11 it has been clear that 
                            we need a war within Islam, not with Islam, and at 
                            least one leader has finally declared it. It would 
                            be nice if some Arab Muslim leaders now did the same.

                            day of reckoning has come," Mr. Musharraf told his 
                            people. "Do we want Pakistan to become a theocratic 
                            state? Do we believe that religious education alone 
                            is enough for governance, or do we want Pakistan to 
                            emerge as a dynamic Islamic state? The verdict of 
                            the masses is in favor of a progressive Islamic state." 
                            The Pakistani president vowed to reform those madrasas, 
                            or Islamic schools, that teach only the Koran, and 
                            not science, math and literature. From bazaars to 
                            barbershops, Pakistan's silent majority responded: 
                            "It's about time." </font>
                          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                            Scholars have long argued that as a country's domestic 
                            policies change, so, too, will its foreign policy. 
                            What happened in Pakistan is just the reverse. Because 
                            of Sept. 11, and the subsequent attack on the Indian 
                            Parliament by pro-Pakistan Kashmiri terrorists, the 
                            U.S. and India made clear that Pakistan's foreign 
                            policy had to change - or America would destroy it 
                            economically and India militarily. There is nothing 
                            like the prospect of being hanged in the morning to 
                            concentrate the mind. So President Musharraf abruptly 
                            ended both Pakistan's support of the Taliban and of 
                            militants seeking to liberate Kashmir. </font>

                            Having created a new Pakistani foreign policy, Mr. 
                            Musharraf's challenge now is to build broad domestic 
                            support. The old Pakistani foreign policy was forged 
                            in the 1980's under dictator Gen. Zia ul-Haq. General 
                            Zia knew he was an illegitimate ruler so, as the Pakistani 
                            political analyst Husain Haqqani put it, "he based 
                            his rule on a military-mosque alliance." He used Muslim 
                            clerics and militant Islam to bless his dictatorship.

                            But Mr. Musharraf realized that using the militants 
                            in Kashmir and Afghanistan would destroy Pakistan 
                            from without and that relying upon them to legitimate 
                            his military regime would destroy Pakistan from within. 
                            So he has laid out a vision that caters to the aspirations 
                            of Pakistan's broad secularized, or moderately religious, 
                            mainstream. But to win the backing of these people, 
                            he will have to empower them, and that requires a 
                            gradual return to democracy. </font>
                          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"When

                            orders," Mr. Haqqani said. "But when you want to rely 
                            on the broader, moderate public, you have to lead, 
                            you have to persuade and you have to empower people 
                            to think and speak for themselves." </font>

                            To put it another way, now that Pakistan has changed 
                            its foreign policy, Mr. Musharraf can either remake 
                            all of Pakistan's jails - to arrest as many militant 
                            Islamists as possible - or he can remake Pakistan's 
                            politics and move from a military-mosque alliance 
                            to a military- Main Street one. To do that, though, 
                            he will have to share power, attract better people 
                            into politics and dare to hold elections, which would 
                            also expose how little support radical Islamists actually 
                            have. When not propped up by the army, they have never 
                            drawn more than 5 percent. Driving into Pakistan's 
                            capital, Islamabad, I am always struck by how the 
                            Parliament, presidency and Supreme Court are all on 
                            one wide boulevard: Constitution Avenue. The only 
                            thing not on Constitution Avenue is Pakistan's Constitution, 
                            which is suspended. That is the road Mr. Musharraf 
                            has to reopen because it is the only one that will 
                            lead him from an alliance with the mosques to an alliance 
                            with Main Street. And if he succeeds, well, who knows 
                            what other leaders may follow? </font>
