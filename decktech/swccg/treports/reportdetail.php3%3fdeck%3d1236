I kept my TIGIH Speeders deck cause it just plain rocks and ditched Rallops for a BHBM designed to kill the bane of my existance, Profit, which has taken away my first place chance the last two tourneys, but if also kills just about everything else.  <br>
     So go to the high school football game the night before, which is even past Green Bay, but am forced to eat at a truck stop to save time instead of something better.  This place was sick.  It smelled like toilet and their road map for the truckers looked more like a Civil War battle map to me.  So I go to the game and we get killed, oh well.<br>
     So tourney day comes and I get there right on time but of course we have to wait for more people to come.  Quite a few of our regular tourney-goers are at the WCW card tourney so all that&#146;s left are 1500ish people, me at 1579, and Chris Tiesling...so I get paired with Chris first game.  Only 10 are there, so it kinda stinks...not even I Trample Obawan Kid showed.<br>
<br>
Game 1: My BHBM vs. Chris Tiesling (1730) using Matt Upstone&#146;s TIGIH Eloms deck<br>
I&#146;d much rather have played my LS vs. his Rallops but my luck breaks down again.  So I drop Palpy first turn to the Landing Platform.  He draws up and p@#$%es the turn.  I forgot to remind him the whole game that he couldn&#146;t generate at Luke&#146;s location though he didn&#146;t drain, otherwise he would have activated like 3 the whole time, but oh well.  I back Palpy up with Darth Vader.  He gets out Honor rather than moving Luke.  He then deploys GLiG1 to Kessel and drains me for 3.  I draw for starships and get a Dreadnaught.  Next turn I drop the naught and EPP Boba piloting on GLiG1 and he loses GLiG1 and draws a 0 so I stay, and immediately after Honor.  Then he backs up with General Calrissian on Tantive IV and I believe Melas or someone like that piloting after I reinforced with DiPO, so I lose Dengar he loses General Calrissian and the Dreadnaught and Tantive sit the whole game at Kessel and I really regret losing my Flagship Executor.  He then deploys Cracken and 2 Eloms to the Docking Bay.  I activate, drop Vader&#146;s Stick on my Vader, drain for 2 and p@#$%.  He moves the Eloms to the Throne Room after deploying another Elom.  So now he&#146;s draining for 4 and not moving Luke and I don&#146;t bother to fetch him because Palpy can&#146;t move to the D*II: Docking Bay right now to begin with.  I&#146;m draining for 2 and doing 3 with Your Destiny.  I know that my +1 in damage can&#146;t hold up forever so I have to do something.  I deploy Iggy with Gun, 4-LOM with Gun, and Dannik to the Throne Room and battle.  I capture an Elom with Iggy, and my kill off another Elom while I prefer to forfeit Dannik and 4-LOM instead of Iggy, who has an Elom.  He then reinforces the site with another Elom, so he now has 2 and a destiny against my 4 and destiny, but I decide not to battle.  I draw up and find some goodies.  I drop Sim Aloo to the Landing Platform and Tempest 1 to the Death Star II Docking Bay and transit Vader and Sim over vs. Cracken and EPP Leia and You Are Beaten Leia, not expecting much out of his 3 card hand.  He deploys an Elom and moves the Eloms at the Throne Room over.  I drain with Palpy and drop Tarkin and battle at the Bay.  I cancel his destiny and draw a 5 myself so he&#146;s practically dead.  Next turn he reinforced with another Elom and p@#$%es.  I battle and kill everyone there.  He loses the 4th card for Insignificant Rebellion and then draws up his last two.  He had a 6 tracked and 1 card on I Feel The Conflict for Anakin Skywalker, so he thought my moving to YAB Leia was the game, though I don&#146;t know how he would have gotten Luke to be lost to play it.<br>
<br>
FW 2 (+13)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning, beating Eloms.<br>
Lows: He activated +4 all game and shouldn&#146;t have.<br>
<br>
Game 2: My TIGIH vs. Jeffery Nickel&#146;s (1475) Corulag Ops<br>
When he starts this I&#146;m like dead, must not be too familiar with all the counters.  It was real too.  He starts a Bargaining Table also.  First turn he drops 3 sites, Motti, Praji, and an operative.  I activate tons because with all his sites he&#146;s giving me and Corulag that&#146;s +5 to my already 6 so I beat down with a Rebel Speeder, 2 Snowspeeders, and a Sandspeeder, along with KFC.  We both draw 3 for destiny, he loses all but Motti and and I lose 1 speeder.  Next turn he deploys more scrubs and battles.  I still have tons more power and win, stacking another card.  He has to forfeit all.  I then spread out and deploy 3 X-Wings to Corulag, still can&#146;t find Incom or a Signal.  So I&#146;m draining for 5 (2 at Landing Platform, 1 at Corulag, 1 at Forest, 1 at Desert.) He drops the Death Star @#$%ault Squadron and battles my X-Wings, making me lose 1 of them.  I land the X-Wings next turn and spread out to 3 sites.  He drops DVDLOTS, though the D* @#$%ault Squadron prevents him from doing that, on my site with a speeder and an X-Wing and I forfeit both.  My drain next turn kills him off.  <br>
<br>
FW 4 (+48)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning without S-Foils, Maneuvering Flaps, or Incom.<br>
Lows: Not getting S-Foils, Flaps, or Incom which would have put a number and a half on him.  <br>
<br>
Game 3: My BHBM vs. Conrad Weis (1479) Ewoks<br>
I drop Palpy to the Landing Platform after deploying it via Arrest Order.  So drops Chief Chirpa and 2 Sentries to Chirpa&#146;s Hut and Chewbacca of Kashyyyk.  I pick up a couple and let him go.  He moves Chirpa and Chewie over after deploying another Sentry to Chirpa&#146;s Hut.  I drop Mara to Chirpa&#146;s Hut but as always can&#146;t find her Saber but battle, making him forfeit the Sentries and then move Mara over to aid Palpy.  He drops General Solo and then I deploy DLOTS, Janus, EPP Boba, and battle.  He reacts over the Sentries and I choke CoK.  I forfeit nothing cause of his zip destiny and he forfeits all his non-uniques, and I have Amanaman place a Tribesman out of play.  I move Palpy to the Throne Room.  He comes back with more Ewoks.  I drop Janus and Emperor&#146;s Power and battle, stacking a 4th card after my battle destiny is 10 and arrtition is +1 cause Amanaman beheaded.  Amanaman gets to behead Kazak this time.  Next turn he gives my Jedi Luke and moves his guys away.  I chase his guys and Rise, My Friend Luke then move to the Throne Room.  I really want to cross Luke, so now I&#146;m draining for 2 and he&#146;s draining for 1 and retrieving 1.  I keep on dueling and losing what I know are 1&#146;s.  After about the 6th duel and the 5th time he draws 2 Ewok Catapults for duel destinies I draw Security Precautions and that&#146;s game.<br>
<br>
FW 6 (+68)<br>
<br>
Highs: Turning Luke.<br>
Lows: He started to catch up on me while I was fooling around and dueling.  <br>
<br>
So Chris and I are opposite sides and all I need to do is win with TIGH and I win it all.<br>
<br>
Game 4: My TIGIH vs. Conrad Weis (1479) TIEs.<br>
He didn;t get Seinar out the whole game.  He started Kessel.  I moved Luke over, dropped the Back Door and 2 Speeders there.  He draws up for 3 turns straight cause he&#146;sed of beating all the newbies and then getting creamed by me all the time.  He finally drops Tyrant to Kessel.  I have Incom out and drop 4 X-Wings and battle.  He loses Tyrant, 1 for I Feel The Conflict, and 2 from damage.  I lose nothing.  He then deploys TIE heaven and battles, but I&#146;m still more powerful.  I stack a second card and he has to forfeit all.  I drain for 6 a few turns and then he deploys Dark Lord Of The Sith to capture Luke.  I now drain for 4 and I only have 2 on I Feel The Conflict so I beat DVDLOTS down with speeders and that&#146;s game.<br>
<br>
FW 8 (+100)<br>
<br>
So I take my first tourney with an interesting differential.  I went to Denny&#146;s afterwards and had undercooked motzerella sticks and you probably know the Dessert selection.  <br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Derek for running a fine tourney.<br>
The WCW tourney for leaving me an easier playing field to win a tourney.<br>
People who traded me.<br>
The Hobbytown Pig-like Dog because it&#146;s cool.<br>
I Trample Obawan Kid for not showing.<br>
Me for winning my first tourney.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Everyone there, including the Hobbbytown Pig Dog for having allergies.<br>
Decipher for not sending prize support that was requested on the 3rd.<br>
I Trample Obawan Kid for not showing.  <br>
Me for beating down the newbies big time.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the read. <br>
