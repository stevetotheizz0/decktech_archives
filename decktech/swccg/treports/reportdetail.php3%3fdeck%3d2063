Our TD was Kevin Ch&#146;ng.  This was the second last tournament before the Victorian states, so it was interesting to observe who was playing &#146;dummy&#146; decks and who was actually doing some serious testing.  <br>
<br>
Around here, I&#146;ve seen a few BHBM decks, but none of them (except for the few space and odds variants) have been any good.  The challenge?  Build and play a decent M&amp;T BHBM deck.  Of course, I don&#146;t actually own any Palpys or Force Lightnings or, come to think of it, any of the actual BHBM stuff, so that came courtesy of Ronnie Wilcox and Stuart Caldwell.  Anyhow, the problem was that all of the M&amp;T style BHBM around here seems to play like any M&amp;T deck and just lose force to the objective.  Of course, this means that Vader is the captain of the hit squad and that basically, Vader gets Fallen Portalled, Jedi Luke gets released and then they lose.  So how was mine different?  For a start, walkers on the ground because I don&#146;t want to lose to Fallen Portal.  Ever.  Secondly, I was set up to duel the living F&amp;*K out of Luke.  A lot of people seem to think that Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout, kills BHBM.  Of course, sending Vader to the DSII: Throne Room seemed like an awful waste, so I planned to POTF the thing and drain for 3 there courtesy of Vader&#146;s stick and Janus.  Did it work?  Yep.<br>
<br>
Light?  Light is looking to be in a pretty sorry state at the moment.  I decided to go with the boring old Deadbolt-stlyle EBO.  Pretty much no tech.  Boring deck, really :)  One mistake that I think I did make was playing EPP Luke instead of LSJK.<br>
<br>
GAME ONE Dark vs. James Ward (MWYHL)<br>
<br>
This one was interesting.  I knew that this game was going to be non-interactive, so I didn&#146;t sweat about getting off to a killer start.  I only deployed one battleground site all game- the Endor: Landing Platform, which James would have to pay some obscene amount to move around (the other non-dagobah sites being Throne Room, DSII: DB and Executor: DB).  I did deploy Rendili, however.  James was rattling along with his training, but didn&#146;t really get anywhere.  I set up the Endor: DB with Igar and Veers on Tempest 1 and Mara.  To get a second battleground, I POTF the Throne Room, which was reinforced with Emperor, Sim, Janus and DLOTS with Stick.<br>
<br>
James, the turn before I decided to plonk Chimaera with Thrawn at Rendili, put Tycho in Green Squadron 3 at Kessel and Lando with Axe and Han with Gun at my DSII: Docking Bay.  I just thought &#146;cool&#146;, rigged some force lightning jank and put back a random 6 or something with Janus.  The above mentioned Chimaera and Thrawn took Kessel pretty easily, James stacked and played a Houjix.  Damn Thrawn&#146;s momma!  For some reason, which I will never understand, James never gave me Luke.  Nonetheless, I deployed Search and Destroy with Honor now satisfied and sat back to play the waiting game.  <br>
<br>
James put Obi-Wan with lightsaber and some other scrubs to my docking bay and Corran Horn to the Executor: Docking Bay.  I deployed another walker to the Landing Platform and, in a moment of utter geniousness, move Igar and Tempest 1 to the DSII: Docking Bay.  Of course, I&#146;d forgotten about Test #2.  Oh well, it didn&#146;t matter.  I barriered Orimaarko, trampled Lando with Axe and got away with losing the walker and Igar.  Next turn, I killed Corran with Dr E and Ponda Baba, stacking a card in the process.  Vader and the walker went to the DSII:DB.  James started to draw up, so I played an IC, Trample, Force Lightning and Circled Obi-Wan.<br>
<br>
2(+20)<br>
<br>
The Good:  Lock down.  It seemed like every time I went to draw destiny there was a Force Lightning on top of my deck.  I must be magic or something (note the sarcasm).<br>
<br>
The Bad:  I had a pretty large hand (about 8 cards or something after I played the recyclables) when James drew up.  That sucked, and was an oversight on my part.<br>
<br>
The Ugly:  Luke was too scared to come and duel Vader.  True, I would&#146;ve won every duel between Sim, Janus and Force Lightining, but at least that way I would&#146;ve been losing one ...<br>
<br>
GAME 2 Light vs Robert Kersherval (HDADTJ)<br>
<br>
I started the bidding with a TT, which was cancelled with an opening hand HoloNet.  I had a Signal, so I activated 3 and Signaled for ANSB.  It was in the 3 that I used, so I grabbed Insurrection and ditched Insight for Honor.  I was thinking that I was fine, seeing as I could still deploy Crix and search for Geezum (I put Geezum in to have a pretty much 100% chance of getting the sites out).  I deployed Crix and searched for Geezum, who wasn&#146;t there, so I grabbed Blount or something.  Next turn, I searched and all I could fine was Ketwol, with no Signals or ANSB showing up.  Hell, the EBO would&#146;ve been nice.  <br>
<br>
Robert, meanwhile, grabbed some docking bays and set up Vader with Stick at the Endor: Dark Forest (drain +1 site).  Tarkin joined him, so EPP Luke showed up and clashed Vader, then beatdown on Tarkin, but I missed the swing (drew the stuff that I should&#146;ve already searched out with a sane draw), so there wasn&#146;t any overflow.  Palpy and Sim set up shop at the Back Door.  <br>
<br>
I still couldn&#146;t find anything (including Geezum), so I just set up Outrider and Falcon at Endor and Hoth to drain for one a piece.  Obi-wan showed up at the 4th marker late game and I deployed Battle Plan.  It was all too late, without EBO showing up, Luke got kicked off Endor, someone took over the Landing Platform and Overseeing It Personally enhanced drains did it.<br>
<br>
0(-9)<br>
2(+11)<br>
<br>
The Good: Nothing.<br>
The Bad: Everything.  I even managed to miss swinging at Vader with Luke.<br>
The Ugly: See the bad.<br>
<br>
GAME THREE Light vs. Ben Tomlinson (HDADTJ)<br>
<br>
Well, I was not happy to be playing against HDADTJ and was less happy to be playing against Ben.  I, once again, started the bidding with an OOC/TT.  Ben let it slide to give us both some breathing room.  Ben deployed Carida and the CC:DB.  I actually got my ANSB this time, so EBO hit the table around turn 4 or so (yeah, yeah, yeah, it was slow).  Ben took over Hoth with Dengar in Punishing One and Boba Fett in Slave One.  I deployed some ships (Wedge and Falcon) to kill them, with an X-Wing Cannon.  Unfortunately, I didn&#146;t have all that much force, so I just shot down Fett and didn&#146;t get to draw battle destiny.  I did, however, Legendary Starfighter my Falcon.<br>
<br>
On the ground, Luke with Stick did some mopping up (courtesy of Mess+Blaster Proficiency) and Boushh handled some excess, before succumbing to a Nevar Yalnal.  Force was flying everywhere, and when the smoke cleared I was on top.<br>
<br>
2(+13)<br>
4(+24)<br>
<br>
The Good: I won.  X-wing Cannons are cool.<br>
The Bad:  Playing two HDADTJ in a row with a bad deck.<br>
The Ugly:  Wedge couldn&#146;t find his ship, so he borrowed Red 9 or something.  For the whole game.<br>
<br>
GAME FOUR Dark vs Ben Tomlinson (TIGIH)<br>
<br>
This was cool, because I was yet to see a good TIGIH in action.  TIGIH isn&#146;t that popular in Melbourne.  First turn, Emperor went to the Landing Platform.  Luke went over to him and Vader took him next turn.  Emperor started to make the trek to the Throne Room and, wouldn&#146;t you know it, I didn&#146;t even have to pay to move Vader over!  I&#146;d started Battle Order, so Ben was in a little bit of strife as to what to do with his scouts.  The usual suspects (General Solo, COK, Midge, Beezer, Crix etc) hit the Rebel Landing Site.  I had a walker sitting at the Landing Platform and apparently I have a bit of a reputation for trampling just about everything and anything (especially Jedi :), so Ben made sure to deploy the Dense Forest between the Platform and other Endor sites.<br>
<br>
I set up Executor and Chiraneau at Rendilli with POTF on it, so I didn&#146;t have to pay to drain and could concentrate on doing some cool stuff.  Ben had just spread out and I was looking at the Mara, You Are Beaten and Evazan + Ponda Baba in hand, wishing there was a practical way to get her stick (I was activating a heap).  I said bugger it and played Rise, My Friend, to return DLOTS and stick to hand.  DLOTS came down with Evazan and Ponda Baba vs Tawss Khaa, General Solo with Electrobinoculars, COK with Mercenary Armor, Brooks Carlson and Tawss Khaa.  I picked a fight and swung at Solo, but my destiny decided to go on holiday, so I missed and Ben breathed a big sigh of relief.  I then choked COK (getting down to my rig from the previous turn) and played YAB on Brooks Carlson so that Solo couldn&#146;t do jack.  I draw a 7, Ben lost everything except the beaten Brooks Carlson, stacked a card and I lost Evazan and Ponda Baba.  <br>
<br>
Ben was caught between a rock and a hard place, so he deployed Home One with Ackbar piloting to hold off the Rendilli drain for a bit.  I deployed Thrawn and Bus and absolutely raped Home One, stacking another card in the process.  Out of desperation, Ben was forced to fight DLOTS again, or something, so another card got stacked.  Ben then decided to give DLOTS Luke and send him to the Throne Room &#146;cause otherwise he would have killed EVERYTHING (DLOTS tends to do that).  I sent my force lightning to the bottom, hoping to draw low and be able to convert for about 10 cards or something.  I activated all but three then used Sim to have a look at Ben&#146;s top card.  It was an OOC/TT, so I left it there and duelled.  To my horror, I drew two 5s.  Ben drew the OOC/TT and ... Insertion Planning.<br>
<br>
2(+29)<br>
6(+53)<br>
<br>
The Good:  Not Vader, that&#146;s for sure.<br>
The Bad:  DLOTS missed the chop.  I guess you could say he &#146;choked&#146;.<br>
The Ugly:  Did you just read that joke?  How bad was it!<br>
<br>
GAME FIVE Light vs Ronnie Wilcox (TDIGWATT Ties)<br>
<br>
I really didn&#146;t want to play this game.  Aside from light sucking in general, I had already seen this deck and it&#146;s both good and original (side note: at the time of writing, it was in the top 10 on decktech).  Basically, Vader got a stick and set up at one CC site.  Xizor set up at another, with some landed ties.  I couldn&#146;t actually find a Luke or Ben to do anything about it, so I just set up EBO and got the Falcon to Hoth.  Sure enough, Ronnie came down with some ties, a dreadnaught and a cannon.  Ronnie fought and couldn&#146;t shoot down the Falcon.  I played Out Of Nowhere and drew enough to make him lose everything and play Legendary Starfighter.  Ronnie set up Bespin with Chimaera and Thrawn and deployed occupation.  <br>
<br>
I had to pay to drain because of Battle Plan, so I couldn&#146;t really do too much.  I took me a while to find Ben/Luke.  I finally did and was prepared to send them to the 4th Marker to occupy a battleground site when Ronnie deployed Palpy there, one turn before I was going to plonk the guys there in order to satisfy Battle Plan.  I skipped a turn of draining to dump them on CC somewhere.  Basically, it came down to a drain (and damage race), so Ronnie naturally won, seeing as he was a) not paying to drain and b) had Dreaded Imperial Starfleet, but it was fairly close.<br>
<br>
0(-14)<br>
6(+39)<br>
<br>
The Good:  My deck didn&#146;t suck too badly.  I think I&#146;m being harsh on it.  It&#146;s not really all that bad, I&#146;m just prejudiced against it from game one.  Legendary Starfighter is ballz.<br>
The Bad:  Too little, too late.<br>
The Ugly:  AOs were flying everywhere (especially thanks to Thrawn).  Apparently Fighter&#146;s Cover made Vader and Xizor immunity to attrition +2 and add 2 to each weapon destiny draw.  Coolness.<br>
<br>
GAME SIX Dark vs Ronnie (Profit)<br>
<br>
Well, I started off with Palpy to the Endor: Docking Bay.  Ronnie started off with Premiere Han in the AC.  First turn, Ronnie deployed the Massa to the Endor: Docking Bay and gave him his stick.  He beat Palpy up for two cards (one of which was the other Palpy), but missed the chop.  Having lost my second Palpy, I opted to play Veers in a walker (yes, General Veers- he works with Command.  Don&#146;t laugh) and moved Palpy to the Death Star II: Docking Bay.  Ronnie had fallen for the docking bay trap.  It was turn two or so, and there was no way in hell that Ronnie was going to be able to afford to send Luke to a safe docking bay.  I licked my lips (well, I didn&#146;t really) in anticipation of another stack.<br>
<br>
Ronnie moved Crix over from the Home One: Docking Bay as backup for Luke.  I didn&#146;t have the heart to do it, so I looked at Ronnie:<br>
<br>
&#146;Are you sure you want to do that?&#146;<br>
&#146;Why not?&#146;<br>
I raised my eyebrow<br>
&#146;What?  Trample?&#146;<br>
I raised my eyebrow some more<br>
&#146;Palpatine&#146;s at the docking bay, you can&#146;t Force Lightning.&#146;<br>
The eyebrow went up even further<br>
&#146;Why not?&#146;<br>
Seeing as I was about to rip my eye open, I said &#146;Think.  What have I got in play?&#146;<br>
<br>
Ronnie looked at BHBM and realised.  He didn&#146;t have too many options, though, so he moved Blount over as well.  Sure as eggs are eggs, DLOTS came down next turn, picked up Luke, choked Blount and made Crix very, very uncomfortable.  I guess Crix didn&#146;t have correct change for the phone.  The walker stayed, Vader started to walk back to the duelling house and the walker sat at the Endor: Landing Platform.<br>
<br>
Ronnie looked around and asked me if Secret Plans was in play.  It wasn&#146;t, so he flipped with EPP Leia to the Audience Chamber and retrieved the damage from the Crix beatdown.  Executor or Chimaera (can&#146;t remember) made it to Rendilli with POTF and Chiraneau.  The walker trekked over to the now-deployed Tatooine: Docking Bay and Vader was beating his son.  In the meantime, I was taking Profit damage.  A turn or two later, IG-88 went to the AC with a destiny rig and I deployed Palpy&#146;s power.  I picked a fight and Ronnie, who realised that the light side seems to suck at the moment, narrow escaped over to Jabba&#146;s Palace.  <br>
<br>
The next happening was quite funny.  I had Veers in his dune buggy at the Tattooine: docking bay and Ronnie had the now-deployed Ben Kenobi with EPP Han, Leia and some scrub, I think, at Jabba&#146;s Palace (who had just beaten up Mara Jade, for some reason, I think).  He was about to move the gang over to the docking bay, but said &#146;wait ... trample&#146;.  What is it with people thinking that I&#146;m going to trample everything they deploy?  I was about to move over, but changed my mind as I didn&#146;t have a massive rig or a Command to hold my own.  Of course, I didn&#146;t have a Trample and Ronnie didn&#146;t have any destiny adders, so we just sat back and traded damage.  This went on for a while until Ronnie decided to come and face off with Veers.  Before Ben could reach for the phone to call Veers&#146; momma, he got squished, so everyone else got killed too.  I think I won by crossing Luke.<br>
<br>
2(+14)<br>
8(+53)<br>
<br>
The Good: Docking Bay trap.  Schweet.  Trample&#146;s apparently quite a good card or something.<br>
The Bad:  Losing Palpy #2 early.<br>
The Ugly:  I don&#146;t think that decipher had holding off a walker and Vader in mind when they designed Crix.<br>
<br>
So I finished the tournament going 4-2, undefeated dark and with only one win light.  I suddenly got the notion that light sucks at the moment.  Ronnie finished the tournament 5-1 and came second.  As far as I can recall (can you tell that I&#146;m writing this report a week on, yet?), Adam Amy won.  I managed to pull Owen and Beru as well as Corran Horn from prize suppport, so I wasn&#146;t too disappointed.<br>
<br>
As for the metagame, Hunt Down still looked as popular as ever.  WYS seemed to drop in popularity a bit and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it seemed that light lost a hell of a lot of games in the first round.  I think that people are hiding their Palace Raiders until the states :P<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
<br>
The traditional card-lending props go to Stuart Caldwell this week and Ronnie.<br>
Veers and Vader&#146;s momma&#146;s for having cool answering machine messages.<br>
Ben for shaking up the field with TIGIH.  I think he crossed Vader in both other games.<br>
Robbo for playing Palace Raider WYS.  Sure, WYS is easily the most popular light deck in Melbourne, but no-one plays the good version!<br>
Adam for playing Agents Of The Black Sun and winning with it!  Booya!<br>
Ronnie for playing a cool (and original) dark deck.<br>
<br>
Hey ... that&#146;s a lot of props for cool decks!<br>
<br>
*Not really the place for this, but Stu&#146;s girlfriend broke her wrist.  Hope you get better soon.*<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
<br>
Rod for playing Tie cannons and Dark Waters.  You&#146;re not allowed to play good cards before the states.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.<br>
Anyone who played Hunt Down (BOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING).<br>
Thrawn&#146;s momma for sending in that Houjix.<br>
<br>
Until the next tournament,<br>
