<br>
I get off the plane in Nashville around 11:00PM thinking Jonny Chu will be at the terminal to greet me.  I get out in the terminal to discover that the airport is closing for the evening.  Evidentially in the south airports close, because of that some security guard wouldn&#146;t let Chu to the terminal so I find Chu down around the luggage.  We get in his car and head for Vanderbilt University, to stay in his dorm.  So Chu and I get to his dorm and we go to the college food store so I could get dinner.  While we&#146;re in there we&#146;re talking ccg and 2 sluts come in and I immediately pause in silence and check them out.  They start talking to us about some concert, and we leave... <br>
Chu and I start playing in his dorm as his gay (in the literal sense) roommates some walking by and watch us, as well as other people.  I doubted my light deck I was playing for the next day so I tested it out.  I was playing HB NON FLIP mains &amp; toys, he was playing his Endor OPS, construct Death Star 2 deck.  Well I lost... then there was a knock on the door, Charlie Herran and his friend Clay showed up.  So I play my light deck against Clay&#146;s TIE Bomber deck, I lose again.  So I then played Charlie with my light deck against his Court Musician deck and lose again.  So I&#146;ve now played 3 games and lost to a Construct a Death Star Deck(Chu), TIE Bombers(Clay), and Musicians(Charlie), so I knew I needed something different for light.  Dark, well I knew that deck was solid, so it needed no testing.  So then Tj Holman shows up and shows Charlie the power of his ROPS.  So around 4:00AM I construct an EBO ISHI TIB deck to play, didn&#146;t bother to test it, cause I played it before in other tourneys. Around 5:00 AM as we all begin to fall asleep Charlie constructs TJ&#146;s rops and we all fall asleep.  <br>
<br>
9/9/2000:<br>
<br>
I wake up around 8:00AM and get off the couch, stand up and see Chu walking to his room, I say hi, and sit back on the couch and fall asleep till 11AM.  We all get up and head to the Grand Slam.  We get there early and find very few SWCCG players there.  So I&#146;m disappointed with the turnout till Cliterous Hays, Steven Lewis, Scott Anderson, and others show their hick faces.  I started to play Tetris on my game boy and that hick Clint tries to shut it of, he is unsuccessful though.  So we all watch Chu construct his death star and we begin the tourney.<br>
<br>
For Light I played to ISHI TIB EBO, and dark I played SCUM2K<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
Random.player(Obi HuT Start w/Toshe) vs SCUM2k<br>
I&#146;m pissed I have to play dark 1st since light side sucks.  I get out Jabba&#146;s Palace &amp; Audience Chamber.  He deploys Master Luke w/ some other guy.  I deploy IG, Djas, Dengar, and cap Master Luke, hit him for like 20 battle damage.  Win by like 29.<br>
<br>
2(+29)<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
Random.guy from Kentucky(ROPS) vs. EBO <br>
Well it was a close game but he lost a ROPS location to a force drain which meant if I could keep jk luke alive on Ralltiir he could never flip his objective, that&#146;s what I did.  I win by 4 simply because ISIH TIBS can&#146;s hold down Igar ( i lost too much force in one battle).  Win by 4.<br>
<br>
4(+33)<br>
<br>
At this point I felt I was in a good position, wouldn&#146;t have too rough of a game 3 cause of differential.  Clint and Tj at this point are busy checking out the 11 year old&#146;s who I guess were hot, if your into 11 year olds with no tits.  <br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
<br>
-If I were from Nashville I&#146;d probably know these hick&#146;s names but I&#146;m not, from Philly thank God.<br>
Random.strangeguy vs EBO<br>
I was very happy bout this match up, 1 because I was light which meant I only have to play light once more, and dark is broke.  2 because I get to sit alongside Clint so I can insult him during the game.  My opponent starts Endor Forsest w/ Combat Readiness to get Dark Forest.  1st turn he goes biker scout, biker scout, bike, bike, go.  For a second I think I&#146;m in trouble.  I activate put projection down, and search reserve deck &amp; discover Battle Plan is activated, game over!  Funny thing happened though, I It Can Waited an Insert, and Clint &amp; I joked about my opponent was amazed I didn&#146;t deploy a system the hole game. I win my like around 20<br>
<br>
6(+53)<br>
<br>
Game 4 <br>
Tj Holman (Rebel Strike Team) vs. Scum2k<br>
Since we both knew each other’s decks we knew I had the best chance at winning.  This game went on forever since we both knew our decks.  He projectioned my drain and killed Galid.  Basically Tj lost the game when he didn&#146;t play his grabber. Win by 20 or so.<br>
<br>
8(+73)<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
-At this point I get matched up against Steven Lewis against his light, Clint was also light which meant they would play each other.  Clint, Steven, and I are the only undefeated left.<br>
<br>
Steven Lewis(HB FLIP KESSEL RUN) vs SCUM 2k<br>
The night b4 I took out Battle Order for There Be Hell To Pay, I regretted it the entire game.  I go 1st turn JP, JP Audience Chamber, then I debate whether to deploy Galid of the bat or Jabba, in the end I decided Jabba casue I had no defense for Galid.  He projections the sight &amp; I start draining for 1 at JP.  Slow game but one of my drains gets kessel off the top of his reserve deck(SWEET).  The very next turn he goes for Tibrin, I tell myself fu*k, he&#146;s gonna go get kessel.  I looked &amp; saw I had a Twilek in my hand, so I get Coward out since he only occupied 1 battleground, it would take him an extra turn at least to get kessel.  I then get out search &amp; destroy and attack Tibrin where he runs away, and then flips.  I have 2 ships out though and I probe, and find hidden base, he it could be worses loss, saw it coming, but I get 5 cards back in reserve.  I all came down to set for stun.  Only once I play this cards against you will you understand the power, it&#146;s a game winner.  Once all ships were on the table 2nd the last turn lewis spreads his fleet moving red x w/ pilot to Death Star.  I got a 6 stacked and during his draw phase I set for stun the guy so he can&#146;t drain their next turn (NICE).  It all comes down to his final turn.  He drains I still have 2 or 3 force left, he initiates a battle against Boba Fett, draws a 1, I live, if it died I lose.  Win by 4.<br>
<br>
10(+77)<br>
<br>
Game 6 <br>
Cliterous Hays(MONKEY TIES) vs EBO<br>
I knew this was a good match up for me though everyone else thought Clint was in better position.  Starting hand , I have Independence, Home One, and Haven.  Since Clint drew up the first 2 turns it game me time to set up.  It was a long game, he&#146;d hit me for 2 or so a turn while I was hitting him with Order To Engage every turn + drain of 2.  He&#146;s retrieve about 3 a turn.  I kill Vader at his docking bay and he keeps deploying TIES there to suffice Battle Order.  I forget to drain with Obi Wan for like 4 turns and I end up winning because Cliterous stalls his last 2 turns.  <br>
Funny point of the game came when I drew Yoda and immediately threw it across the room cause he sucks.  <br>
Timed win +7  <br>
<br>
11(+84)<br>
<br>
So I won the thing!<br>
<br>
PROPS<br>
Chu for picking me up at the airport and letting me stay at his place Friday.<br>
Cliterous for driving be to the Nashville Qzar where I ganked his @#$% 32 hits to his 7 hits.  <br>
<br>
SLOPS<br>
Cliterous for not putting out while on his date with Tj, and letting me shower in the same place he masturbates.<br>
Chu&#146;s roommates(you know what I&#146;m talking about Chu)<br>
<br>
Just to let you guys know that I&#146;m taking first in day 1, day 2, and will be champion day 3, then Ghetto Squad will spray paint the trophy. <br>
