<br>
A light side mains&#146;n toys deck constructed to have a chance to beat any DS deck. The key cards are Mantelian Savrip, and weapon levitation. With these cards you will probably win every battle, at least that was what i thought. The shocking informations gives me very high average destiny in the end of the games. This combined with Throne room as starting location (deploy a character on Jabba&#146;s palace first turn to cancel that gametext) and most important, 4x tunnel vision (to get all cards you ever need) was the best deck to me.<br>

Manipulator using jabbas palace to get much force generation early in the game. Get Jabba out to get even more. Scan his characters away until Nightlily is out. Sense dangerous cards, manipulate his forcepile and drain on tatooine. I suspected many to use a deck like this, but i think i was the only one. <br>
<br>
Game 1.<br>
<br>
My DS deck VS Hrvoje Kap<br>
There were 43 competitors in this tourney. Four of them from my city, one of them is Dragon, who I have to face in my first game. He plays Hoth clouds starting on Do Or Do Not. Since we play a few times each weak we know each others deck perfectly. I drain on tatooine, he drains on hoth. I get my drain going a little faster, and manipulate his miners away, making my drains bigger. When he comes to Tatooine, so does Bubo and in the end I invade Hoth with Vader. A game I was supposed to win, and so I did. With 11 force. <br>
<br>
Total score: 2 (+11)<br>
<br>
Game 2.<br>
<br>
Total score: 2 (+11)<br>
<br>
My LS deck VS Jakob Nordin, 4:th ranked player in my region.<br>
I start on Throne room, he starts on Jabbas palace. I get Wedge out on jabbas palace the first turn to prevent him from searching for locations. Unfortunately he had lots of locations in hand, so that was not such a big loss for him. My next turn I deploy a few locations and Luke to Jabbas palace. He Deploys Bubo to Jabbas palace and eats Wedge. My next turn I use tunnel vision to get the signal to get mantelian savrip which i deploy. I also deploy ObiWan to jabbas palace. In his turn he deploy lots of characters and vader to jabbas palace and start battling me. I throw an other ObiWan to the Savrip. He moves away. In my turn I deploy uncontrolable furry, use tunnel vision to get grimtaash. I use it, and see that he has got no ghhhk in hand. Somewhere inside jabbas palace there is a lone Mii&#146;oom onith. I use an other Tunnel vision to get nabrun leids. Flying to Mii&#146;oom, deploying anakins saber, batteling and playing courage of a skywalker makes him loosing 16 cards. The rest of the game is just draining and loosing cards for uncontrollable furry. I win by 27 in the end.<br>
<br>
Total score: 4 (+38)<br>
<br>
Game 3:<br>
<br>
My DS VS Kasper Christiansen, Red 45<br>
He was playing a cloud city deck starting on bespin: cloud city and then deploying clouds next to cloud city and draining. I know that the system is required if you want to deploy clouds, but I didn&#146;t think of it at that time. This was my absolute closest game, he got his drains going early, and he only had upper plaza coridor in play, so I couldn&#146;t deploy to cloud city. He never got any characters out, thanks to mii&#146;oom, but his drains were bigger than mine. I drew lots go get an elis, but it took me long time to get one. I was almost certain that I would loose all the time, but then I could fly Vader to the miner and kicking him, coursing some force loss. I won this one too, but if that elis had showed up one turn later, I would probably have lost. Sometimes you need luck! I win by 11.<br>
<br>
Total Score: 6 (+49)<br>
<br>
Game 4.<br>
<br>
My LS VS I cannot remember his name.<br>
He started on Raithal with a cloud city trooper deck with odds. The first think i did was to get tantive out on raithal and to get the savrip on table (thanks to tunnel vision). When he started to insert odds i deployed Wedge. He deployed troopers to cloud city, and boba fett. I deploy Obi Wan to cloud city and start batteling and moving troopers away. He deploys Boba fett and plays hiden weapons, which i sense. And like this the game goes on, I drain him in space, and we are batteling on cloud city. The savrip saves me, and when the odds reaches top his total is 7 and mine is 6. This was the easiest game for me in the tourney, I win by 35. <br>
<br>
Total Score: 8 (+84) <br>
<br>
Game 5.<br>
<br>
My LS VS Johnny Ohlsson<br>
He plays a space deck with tallon rolls and undercovers. I get lots of locations out, and he gets just 4 the entire game. After a few turns, and 3 tunnel visions i have Luke, Captain Han, falcon, don&#146;t get @#$%y, the force is strong with this one and mantelian savrip in hand. I deploy all these to kashyyyk. He deploys a stardestroyer, a few pilots, vader and his Tie and tries to tallon roll me, but i sense it. Then he battles me, i play the destiny adders and draw destiny 20. This wipes out everythin, but the TIE. The rest of the game went slow, me draining 2-4 each turn. Traffic control gets out, and I win by 28. Saved by the Savrip again. <br>
<br>
Total score: 10 (+112)<br>
<br>
Game 6.<br>
<br>
My DS VS a player who had won all, but one, which was a draw giving him one point. If I won this one, I would be in final, otherwise, thanks to my big differential, I would probabay go to the final anyway. He plays LS space with on the edge and lots of X wings. Manipulating him to draw doubles of cards to monnok, draining him big, and getting Devastator out won this game pretty easy, this is the kind of deck I want to face with my DS deck. I win by 18 I think, and I am in the final. <br>
<br>
Total score: 12 (+130)<br>
<br>
Final.<br>
<br>
The final is played VS Kasper Chrisitansen, who I played earlier in the tourney. Someone pointed out that he couldn&#146;t deploy his clouds without the bespin system in play. He had no bespin in his deck, and only 2 locations that he may deploy, so everyone thought this would be an easy victory for me. It was not that easy though, My first game was played VS his DS mains&#146;n toys deck. I start with the throne room, but get either characters or locations in my starting hand. He gets lots of force generation, I get 6 each turn. Luke out VS his Jabba, but he kills him. I get obi-wan out, but he plays the circle is now complete. Then comes Gailid, adding force drains and U3PO, blocking my only drain. Some more battle occurs, but I loose this one pretty easy with 18 cards.<br>
<br>
Then it was time for my DS VS his not-working cloud city deck. I get lots of drain going early, and he gets 2-3 each turn, giving me an easy victory by 25 I think. This means I am in the WCs, hoping to see you there!<br>
<br>
Thank you Magnus Larsson, Red 64 and Decipher for a great tourney. I look forward to the WC!<br>
