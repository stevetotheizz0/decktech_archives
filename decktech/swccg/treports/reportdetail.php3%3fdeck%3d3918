I&#146;m getting a ride up with Paul Maholick, and Mike Pistone is riding up with us as well, between those two, it really looked like one of the persons riding in the car, were going to bring home the very swell first place prize support, a set of Black Boardered Premiere Rares..... So I get picked up at McDonalds, Mike and Paul are out waiting for me, I hop out of my mothers car and we exchange the usual hi&#146;s and blah blah blah, and then Mike shows me the HUGE @#$%ING two bizzillion ounce soda that he&#146;s gotten from McDonalds, and this absolutely insanely big bag of Cooler Ranch (the best damned chips on the planet) and from there we hop into Pauls car and awayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy we go! <br>
<br>
So we get off to an amazing start....... on our conversations that is, Mike and Paul were making me laugh the whole way up, it was defintely the greatest time I&#146;ve ever had going to a tournament, and because of the good mood it put me in, I had a great time at the tournament, even when I played crappy the last three games..... But thats for later.... Now on this ride, we discuss just about everything.... From um.... *ahem* befriending sailors for Japenese foil tech (they&#146;re never going to let this one go), to how to better my huntdown deck, to how cool Bastian is, to even how tall the Hunter family is...... I do some initial trading with Mike on the way up, in between the laughs, and I get a few of the cards I&#146;ll be needing for the day, and we arrive in rather good time (Yay for directions!).<br>
<br>
When we get inside the church, many players are already there (which suprised us, as they&#146;re were perhaps one or two cars outside), and with some time to spare, Pistone and Maholick help me disect my Huntdown deck, immeditely we toss the dualing crap, which for some god awful reason I was playing, and instead made it into a very well put together deck (it was okay before, but lacking in many areas). Paul lets me borrow IPO/Secret Plans combo, which later be his undoing, and without that card, I don&#146;t believe I would have done nearly as well as I did.... <br>
<br>
The parings are then announced and I face a fellow teenager whom is playing in his first tourny ever..<br>
<br>
My rating going in is 1618, his 1500 (sorry I can&#146;t remember your name man, its one of my BIGGEST problems, please do not take it personal).<br>
<br>
My LS deck (QMC), vs his (lended to him by Josh Radke I BELIEVE) COTVG<br>
<br>
The game starts (I deploy Guest Quarters, the System, Menace Fades, SQUASS, and Keeping the Empire out Forever) and I&#146;m kind of uneasy, as I&#146;ve never played against this decktype and have NO idea how to  go about beating it, but non the less, I know that if I can set up QMC fast enough, everything SHOULD be allright. First turn he deploys a site and draws a few cards. My turn comes, I activate, drop EPP Obi and a site from hand and the deck, then look at his objective and find out I&#146;m supposed to loose a force every turn I don&#146;t have a character on Tatooine, and that he should have as well first turn, but I don&#146;t care, its his first tourny, so I loose my one and just politely ask him to try to remember from now on. He&#146;s cool with it, and I can tell he obviously just wasn&#146;t too familiar with the objective... So the game goes on for a few more turns when suddenely he drops Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and Bossk In Hounds tooth against my Ten Numb with Intruder Missiles (I really didn&#146;t think he was going to have space, I really should have looked at his objective better lol), and he iniates battle, I blow Bossk out of the sky, and he draws low, Ten Numb lives. Next turn we battle again, this time though I have wedge there with cannons, I shoot down Zuckuss, and the battle ends. Cloud City Celberation is now out and I&#146;m retrieving, my objective is flipped and he&#146;s not challeninging me on CC, so I just drain away with Pucimir. We duke it out once more in Space, this time he has star destroyers, but oddly, he doesn&#146;t battle right away, and next turn I drop down Han Chewie and the Falcon, and he&#146;s gone... I drain him out retrieving the whole while, at the I offer him so defensive shields since he didn&#146;t play any and he politely rufses, commenting he had his own, he just didn&#146;t play them... So I felt a little bit better...<br>
<br>
FW 2+27 (or something like that)<br>
<br>
Highs: Getting a nice start, doing some tracking with A Few Manuvers<br>
Lows: I really didn&#146;t feel good beating a  kid by so much going to his first tournament...<br>
<br>
It turns out I&#146;m placed rather high amongst the wins and so the parings are again announced<br>
<br>
My DS Huntdown vs (I should KNOW this name, and once again I feel downright awful for not) MWYHL<br>
<br>
<br>
This was amongst the most fun I&#146;ve EVER had playing a game. The whole time we cracked jokes about our own moves and had an all out blast. I start my normal crush, colo, and IAO/Secret Plans (GOD I LOVE THAT CARD!), and he started the usual jedi test stuff (All I can really remember is Twilight is Upon me). Not much went by for a little while, he ate small visage damage from me after I put down Blizzard 4 down at the Nemodian Flagship Docking Bay and Deployed Vader with his Japenese Foil Stick (MAD TECH!!!! Har Har) for a few turns before he popped out honor... Luckily Paul had made sure I had No Escape in my deck (I already had put it in, but that was at his insistence before lol), and so I search for a docking bay to see if my Twilek or No Escape could be in my force pile next turn... No such luck, both of the damned things are in my deck... So he gets away with no damage from No Escape for a few turns but I keep draining him for two, one at the Flagship docking bay, one at the CC Docking bay, I could have drained for three had he not had Jedi Test #1 completed at that time (his hand draw wasn&#146;t very good, he commented he should have had it out earlier, and I was impressed with his playing, so I believe that he could have done it had his luck been better with the draws).. So finally a few turns later I get No Escape out and get Prephared Defenses back (Yippie lol), and a couple turns later he drops Corran Horn down to the Holotheatre, but not alone, with Chewbacca Protector with Chewies BowCaster, and Obi Wan with his stick. I soon get Dr. E&amp;Panda Baba over there along with Sideous, 4 Lom with Concussion Rifle, and Boba Fett Bounty Hunter (I only put him down for the Power, since he couldn&#146;t add destinys), we battle, I use I have you Now, he shoots at someone with Chewie but misses, swings with Obi and Hits..... I draw a seven off the top, and then a low destiny which I switched for the 7 on the fish, he got to lower each one by 1 (I think test #3), but the twelve was enough in attrition to wipe his characters , I don&#146;t know how it got him to clear his site, I think we had a battle before that where I only had Sidious and 4-Lom where I got one of them, and I lost 4-Lom but got to keep sidious due to his immunity to attrition, but I really don&#146;t remember). The game is just me draining and eating at him with some visage from there, until near the end, he dropped Obi and his matching Saber over at Darth Mauls game controlled CC Docking Bay, and he iniates, he swings, I force field so his cancelling is targeted, then we draw, I use Maul Strikes and have phantom menace on the table, so his 5 does nothing to Maul, I get a total of ten or so, and he looses Obi and a few.... The time limit is drawing near, and he KINDLY draws up, and gives me the full win.<br>
<br>
FW+19 (I believe, once again I&#146;m not sure)<br>
<br>
Highs: A very fun game to play, defintely a person I would love to play against again<br>
Lows: None really, it was just an overall good time.<br>
<br>
Okay so now I&#146;m 2-0, and I&#146;m matched up against Paul of all people... I&#146;m 0-3 against him, but he&#146;s always cool to play against, always letting me know how to improve after every game.... <br>
<br>
My Huntdown (which he helped me build to defeat LS Combat) vs..... Paul&#146;s LS Combat<br>
<br>
I&#146;m very nervous going into this game, though I know my deck is meant to beat his, I know he is a far better player then I am, so I prephare to just do as best as I can. The game starts and we both comment on our sucky draws, mine only crappy since I didn&#146;t have a vader yet... He starts goo ney ta and the race against me... First turn he starts the race, he gets like a total of 8 or 10, I draw a one so I decide right there to not bother even trying with the race lol.... Soon I get Maul down and he drops Qui Gon to duel him, he put a combat card on him and we draw, I VERY luckily get a 7 and a 5 (I think a Phantom Menace and Force Lightining) and actually win, next turn I drop some beats and he trys to dodge but I cancel with Ghhk Combo Card, and wipe qui gon from the table and would do more, but he has a Houjax. Vader gets down 3-4 times during the game, but gets taken off the table rather quickly each time. I forget to drain most of the game, and he soon wins the race. He has a noticable lost pile, but can&#146;t retrieve because the IAO/Secret Plans that he lended me is on the table (had he retrieved he would have won), I deploy the racing shield to stop the bloody I did It! A few more LS Duels, I loose every one of them I believe, and he drops Corran over at the Holotheatre, I drop Vader with Stick and battle. I play I have you Now and drew decent, wiping corran and causing some good overflow.... I never bother deploying another visage because he has a jedi on the table quite often. The final turn consisted of me battling Yoda with Maul and getting some hitting yoda, then causing some overflow damage that won the game for me... I was absolutely estatic, and after shaking Pauls hand for a good game, head over to get some pizza.<br>
<br>
FW 2 +9 (6 +45 around that I believe),<br>
<br>
Highs: Playing a very good game, and finally beating Paul<br>
Lows: I really don&#146;t think I would have won had Paul not helped me with my deck.<br>
<br>
From there on out I play like absolute @#$%. So execuse me if I just brief up the last few games, I would rather forget how poorly I performed<br>
<br>
My QMC vs Karl Sunbergs TDIGWATT<br>
<br>
Damn did I get my @#$% handed to me here. Karl Sunberg is an excellent player and played very well this game, stupidly I forget to check his effects and don&#146;t start Don&#146;t Do That Again.... So he gets out executor rather quickly, Palpy down to a site, converts my system (which I guess was good because he would have drained for three once he got up there with Chinerau), I hold off going into space, because he monnocks my Intruder Missiles (2 of them) and I can&#146;t find any of my damned matching pilots. I finally get some characters down to some sites, but can&#146;t drain for more then one because of my objective. When I finally go up into space, I shoot down the Executor, with a blind draw, and happily watch as it crashes and burns, his occupation is canceled because I end up having the last forfeit. Non the less he gets 5 in overflow due to his 5 destiny draws. Its too late for me at that point, but canceling occupation bought me two turns in which I could give him a few drains in return now that my objective was flipped.. We battle once on the ground and he trys to choke Pucimir but draws a 1, but still clears the site.... I draw up afterwards and thats game<br>
<br>
FL 0 (6 +20 something).<br>
<br>
Highs: Blowing up the Executor!<br>
Lows: I guess I can&#146;t say many, though I didn&#146;t play at my best, Karl is just a better player<br>
<br>
Now I get matched up to another good player who&#146;s name I forget... <br>
<br>
My QMC vs SYCFA No Flip Fear Will keep them in Line<br>
<br>
I @#$%ing played terrible in this game. Possibly my worst playing all day, when I finally got ten numb up to bespin with Han Chewie and the Falcon and Outrider (which he lateral damages) I STUPIDLY try to to shoot at the executor twice, even when I had an almost definate hit on each of his other two star destroyers.... I was ready to blow my brains out at that point and hope to grow new ones rather then keep the ones I had..... Needless to say I flipped way too late and his Fear just absolutely devastates me (I hate that new (V) card!) and he beats the snot out of me. Full loss by 16<br>
<br>
FL 0 (I&#146;m just about at 0 now)<br>
<br>
Highs: Finding out that I really need to add more space to QMC, hell I thought 5 ships was enough, but why can&#146;t I find my damn pilots or ships ever, oh and using Punch it for something other then a line on a car ride!! Remembering to start Don&#146;t Do That Again against Mob Points for once!<br>
Lows: This time I know playing piss poorly had a MAJOR effect on the outcome, I can&#146;t say I would have won but I think I could have done alot better then what my performance here showed. <br>
The last game, I hate to say, but I don&#146;t really even wish to bring up this game. Half the damned time, I didn&#146;t know what was going on, he never announced that he was taking back things, so I figured he had moved the outrider down to the tatooine docking bay then back up again and mirax over there from Home one Docking bay and back again, and I couldn&#146;t tell which was his force pile and used pile so I never kept track of thing (I later found out he played with his used pile behind his reserve deck, I don&#146;t know, its just harder to do things when you can&#146;t figure out what is going on).... The absolute low point of the game was when I iniated battle and went to play Weapon Levitation and he pulled out the shield to stop me from using it.... Saying he believed he had action after I iniated battle, I didnt bother calling a ruling, though I believe I had it, but thats my fault and it cost me dearly.... Somehow he gets alot of cards back into his deck and wins by 27.<br>
<br>
FL 0 (6 -something)<br>
Highs: Eh, I dunno<br>
Lows: I was lost the whole damned game, and argh, I don&#146;t know.... <br>
<br>
So Paul and Pistone got 3rd and 4th respectively, and I pulled like a 7th or 8th  place out of 19 so I guess I didn&#146;t do THAT bad. Still I think Paul and Pistone should have 2nd and 3rd respectively but thats something I really don&#146;t care to explain, had you been there, you may figure why.<br>
<br>
Mike and I pull absolute @#$% in our DSII packs, I still have yet to pull a single @#$%ing Jedi Luke.... The first person whom I played who got last, pulled one, so I guess thats cool, it should keep him coming back. I gave him my Chimera before he pulled it, and another kid who had only been to one other tourny the other three rares from the packs (Pistone gave me his) then chuck the commons and uncommons since I have no need for them nor did anyone else.<br>
<br>
After we hit the road, I realized I had forgotten to get some of my theed cards back from someone I was going to trade cards with, but I honestly don&#146;t care, I think he needed them more. So if your reading this, don&#146;t worry! I&#146;ll just make sure to get a simple rare or something next time we meet :)<br>
<br>
The trip back had its high points, noticablly the talk about how to improve decks and so forth and how the day went blah blah blah...<br>
<br>
Paul drops me off at McDonalds and after saying good bye to him and Pistone I head over to my parents who are waiting for me and go off home...<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Getting another Lord Vader and DVDLOTS in trade<br>
Beating Paul for the first time ever<br>
Having a Solid first three games<br>
To everyone for showing up, having 19 people is awesome<br>
Paul for the ride<br>
Paul and Pistone for the funniest @#$%ing car ride ever.<br>
Josh for putting together the tournament and offering such a hefty first place prize, I know that defintely had to drain your cards man<br>
To the person whom Josh mentioned gave him the 7-8 cards he was missing from being able to give away a whole BB Premiere set of rares<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Playing piss poorly for the later half of the tournament report<br>
To the fact that Paul and Pistone probably should have actually been 2nd and 3rd but weren&#146;t.... Due to a reason which I don&#146;t believe should be discussed here.<br>
To AIM for not working yesterday night or today, so I couldn&#146;t ask anybody if they wished this tourny report not to be posted or changed for any reason... Good Lord AIM is a piece of @#$% sometimes...<br>
<br>
Overall a good time.... A good enough reason to bother writing my first tournament report even though I&#146;ve been to 12 or so (though still a meek number)....<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it.<br>
