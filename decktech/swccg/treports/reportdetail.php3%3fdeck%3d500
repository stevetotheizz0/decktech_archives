I figured I might as well write my first Tournament report.<br>
<br>
About 2 months or so before this Tournament, I told myself<br>
'I am going to win this tournament.  I'm gonna be the Provincial<br>
Champion'.  Cocky words, but I felt the feat was doable.  I placed<br>
7th in last years regional, and 4th in the year before that,<br>
so I figured my time was due :) <br>
<br>
Back then, I'd already figured out my Dark deck.  Rops all<br>
the way, it's been my favorite deck for over a year.  I've<br>
tried probably every variation of the thing you can imagine,<br>
and have been successful with them all.  Troopers, Bikers <br>
Scouts, AT-AT's, AT-ST's, lots of imperials, draining versions,<br>
beating versions, numbers, and more.  AT-ST's are definitely<br>
the best version, providing power, reacting, decent deploy,<br>
and protection from weapons, so AT-ST's it would be.  I toyed<br>
with massive high destiny Hunt Down decks for awhile,<br>
but in my opinion, Hunt Down is too fragile.  When things<br>
begin to go wrong, it always seems like they just keep going<br>
wrong...  Although, things don't go wrong often.<br>
<br>
Light was a complete different story.  I KNEW I壇 be going<br>
mains... Mains is my style.  Lots of mains.  high destiny.<br>
Beating.  The good stuff :)  So I fooled around with my<br>
here's Ben deck, posted on decktech...  but truthfully,<br>
and I knew it at the time, that deck is not worthy to win<br>
a Championship.  A strong deck, but it was overly<br>
designed to deal with the new bounty hunters with lots<br>
of put that downs and blaster deflections.  So then I began<br>
to fool around with a profit deck, also posted on decktech.<br>
This deck met with some success, but I just wasn't happy with it.<br>
<br>
Well, a week before the tournament, two friends of mine<br>
broke up there relationship, and I had a TON of school work to<br>
do (Exams coming up).  Between school, work, and comforting<br>
my friends, I had no time for starwars.  I gave up on<br>
winning, it was always a unrealistic idea any ways.<br>
<br>
I ended up building a Throne Room deck with really light<br>
SAC.  Good force generation, juts like Tosche Station,<br>
but more reliable.  Throne Room just suits my style, although<br>
I hadn't played one for over 4 months.<br>
<br>
I'll be posting both decks soon.<br>
<br>
Didn't go to sleep till 2 AM, that was a mistake.  My<br>
friend Justin was picking me up at 5:30 am for the 4<br>
hour trip to Vancouver (we're both from Kamloops).<br>
well my alarm went off, snooze.  snooze.  reset for<br>
another 20 min.  <br>
Justin had to find an open door and wake me up :)  <br>
what a way to start.<br>
<br>
It was a nice trip to Vancouver, but Justin being the<br>
moron he is :p  got us lost in Vancouver.  We didn't<br>
have a map, but here's a quick rundown:<br>
me: 'Stay on this Highway.  Take an exit around here.'<br>
him: 'uhh... whatever'.<br>
a little bit later...<br>
me: 'Why are we going over this bridge... This is North<br>
      Vancouver! you dumbass!  turnaround'<br>
him: 'uhh... whatever'.<br>
me: 'Follow the signs to highway 1 west.  so left here'.<br>
him: 'ok'<br>
me: 'why did you just turn right when the sign SAYS LEFT!!!??'<br>
him: 'trust me this is the way'.<br>
<br>
Eventually we got where we needed to go :)<br>
<br>
We had a quick game of my Rops deck vs his light,<br>
it was a obi hut Tosche station start.  he beat me,<br>
I wasn't too pleased about that... out of 20+ games<br>
of this deck with him, he'd only beaten twice before that,<br>
but that's bound to happen when you learn your opponents deck<br>
inside out :)<br>
<br>
Well tournament starts, Deck lists.  Ugg I hate those things.<br>
I named my decks 'Throne Room, Sagan Style' and 'Rops, Sagan Style'.<br>
original.  Good turnout to the tournament, 33 people.<br>
<br>
First match ups were surprising, at the top table, top spot,<br>
were Kevin Wan and Nicholas Burke, the top two rated players<br>
in BC.  I was placed at the 2nd top game, and I知 rated 4th<br>
in BC, so again, weird.  James Hsu, I think he's rated 3rd,<br>
was in the 3rd game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1:  Throne Room, Sagan Style   vs Brendon Browns (1603) Hunt Down.<br>
<br>
My games get a little fuzzy, I think his start was huntdown.<br>
I dropped some 2/0 sites, nudj, lose a force.  He drops a<br>
quarren to my swamp, moves over to the farm where my nudj is.<br>
lose a force.  Tawws makes an appearance, Draw there fire comes<br>
out, I predict I知 winner, My lost pile is now empty.  lose a force.<br>
He gets out the wastes.  I drop boushh to his holotheatre, <br>
break cover, cancel Visage.  Civil Disorder, Oola makes an <br>
appearance- I think, cause I remember seeing his hand at one point.<br>
He loses to disorder, and my drains of 2.  Soon, a shmuck load<br>
of troopers make an appearance at the holotheatre.  Boussh<br>
nabruns to the wastes, I'm safe!  Civil Disorder canceled though :(<br>
he Elis's to boushh next turn, I nabrun back to the holotheatre.<br>
he moves 3 of his troopers to obi's hut.  Obi makes an appearance,<br>
Han, and Chewie with guns also follow.  Clash one trooper, move the other<br>
away, big force loss for him.  Game.<br>
<br>
FW + 33.<br>
<br>
For my next matchup, I知 placed around the 5th highest matchup.<br>
Justin won his by 41, congrats.  he's placed at the 2nd matchup.<br>
<br>
Game 2: Rops, Sagan Style vs Jamie Nay's (1519) Throne Room.<br>
<br>
Throne room start... bad feeling or crush... I go with<br>
bad feeling, the only way I'd need crush instead would be<br>
if he has 6+ revo's.  He picks up.  I get a site out,<br>
some 2/0 sites, pick up.  His turn, I think some sites come<br>
out, he narshadda's.  Interesting.  Pulls an Elom.  Inserts.<br>
Now I知 running scared, alls I would need would be 4-5 eloms<br>
beating up on one of my walkers (that aren't out yet) combined<br>
with Romas Lock to prevent reacts.  I activate, insert comes up.<br>
0 - 0, no force loss.  Deploy my swamp which I picked up<br>
over his, bubo pulled from reserve, eat the nudj!  roar!<br>
bubo moves over, eats the other one.  His turn, 3 eloms+chewie<br>
with gun come and kill Bubo, and he inserts.  My turn,<br>
activate, drop 3 walkers with pilots, flip.  Pick up<br>
vesden, this could be interesting.  He turn, no drain,<br>
pick up I think.  Insert comes up on my turn, 9-9, no force<br>
loss.  Choke Vader + Tarkin visit his elom force, choke chewie,<br>
and pull 4 +3 destiny.  he loses two eloms.  His turn, runs<br>
to his throne room.  I drain, and sit pretty.  One or two<br>
more battles go by in my favor, game over<br>
<br>
FW +29<br>
<br>
Game 3: Throne Room, Sagan Style Vs Arian Delisle (1746) ISB.<br>
<br>
ISB start, haven't played against one of those for awhile.<br>
Well some turns go by, my sites come out, he FIANLLY gets<br>
out jabba's palace and audience chamber.  Two Outer rim<br>
scouts come down to yavin, flips his objective, beats up<br>
my nudjs, he moves them together.  hmm.. Leia, Han, Chewie<br>
make an appearance, only hit one ORS, he ghhhks.  Obi, obi's<br>
saber, and Luke+saber make an appearance to his Audience chamber,<br>
bacta tank out.  He loses some force, Out of Commission!!!<br>
got his Chall Bekan, yeesssss!  His turn, Jabba, Boba Fett,<br>
4-Lom, and Dr. E try there luke with obi and luke.  4-lom<br>
cancels Lukes text, damn.  Clash Jabba, no destiny adding<br>
for you :)  hack 4-lom.  Destiny comes and goes, I clear his<br>
site, cept for jabba, luke to the tank.  Next turn, luke goes<br>
back to the audience chamber, more ORS come to yavin to flip<br>
his objective again, deploys Tempest Scout 2 and moves an ORS<br>
into there, the other ones at the throne room. he also did <br>
something to kill luke.  Luke goes to the tank.  My turn,<br>
Drop luke against the ORS at the throne room.  Imperial Barrier, <br>
Skywalkers cancels Imperial Barrier.  ROAR!!!  well I beat<br>
up the scout, hacked, draw 0 for destiny.   he still loses<br>
3 force.  I drain him out. <br>
<br>
FW +29<br>
<br>
Game 4 Rops, Sagan Style vs David Houles (1826) Throne Room.<br>
<br>
<br>
Another throne room.  Great.  His turn, he drops 3 2/0 sites,<br>
a nudj, revos my Ralltir.  Great.  This could go bad.<br>
Well I search for a site, drop a 2/0.  He picks up.  I drop<br>
another site, pick up.  he gets out Obi to a Ralltir site,<br>
Han + leia to another.  Crap.  Tawss joins Obi.  I <br>
get out Kashyyyk, Boba in slave 1 there.  drop Vader, Tarkin<br>
in Tempest Scout 3, and another AT-ST with pilots against<br>
obi and tawws, battle, he hacks and misses Tarkin, he<br>
loses Tawws.  his turn, run obi to my jungle.  Now he's<br>
draining for 2, I知 draining for 3.  He deploys Tantive<br>
to Kashyyyk, battle order, then moves the Tantive to Raltirr.<br>
uhh.. ok.  I leave some walkers at the forest, vader+tarkin<br>
and tempest scout 3 go to the jungle after obi.  He drops<br>
draw there fire, Lower corridor, orri and oola there, Order<br>
to engage, moves tantive back after Boba, and runs gets<br>
out someone else to my site with just two walkers, runs <br>
obi there.  My turn, deploy some more guys to the jungle,<br>
battle tantive, I retrieve one he loses one.  Spiral reacts, I知 immune to his attrition, I lose<br>
2,<br>
he loses spiral.  I lose 3 to order to engage, and get<br>
Tarkin and Vader over to the middle site, leave some guys<br>
at jungle.  His turn, drain for 2, oola (no guys), nabruns<br>
han+leia to my jungle.  I grab it, now I知 out of force.<br>
he battles.  I think I知 screwed...  looking at my other site,<br>
I see Tempest scout 1, reacts for free!  Vader and Tarkin hop<br>
on, leaving tempest scout 3 + 2 at st pilots (one outside)<br>
to face obi and some other guys.  I choke Han, he misses<br>
Tarkin, big loss for him.  He uses savrip and Boussh, still<br>
loses 10 more.  he has no destiny left, so no battle against<br>
my puny force at the forest.  my turn, drain for 2 in space,<br>
one on ground, lose 3 to order to engage, run some guys over<br>
to obis hut.  He drains for 2 at lower corridor, I drain him<br>
out, to complete one of the most stressful games I致e<br>
ever played.<br>
<br>
FW +13<br>
<br>
Game 5  Throne Room, Sagan Style vs Kevin Wan (1918) huntdown.<br>
<br>
He start epic duel, Damn.  I feel a loss coming up.  I drop<br>
a nudj, a 2/0 site, make him lose a force to visage, and then cancel it<br>
with transmission terminated.  BOOM!  yet another thing that<br>
went right for me in this tourney.  I look at my hand, and<br>
my mouth drops.  Obi, his stick, oola, civil disorder, two more<br>
2/0 sites.  he activates, picks up.  my turn, activate 8,<br>
nudj comes out, Obi + stick and oola to farm, civil disorder.<br>
He loses 2, picks up.  I drain for one, oola his hand.  <br>
rinse and repeat, I get out some more 2/0 sites, he gets<br>
out a docking bay.  Leia+blaster hits the docking bay.  <br>
Mara comes to play, doesn't find her saber.  Battle, leia<br>
hits Mara, both dead.  Next turn, 4-lom and Ig-88 come to visit<br>
obi, since I killed the nudj for a bigger drain.  He loses 2<br>
to civil since they're both droid and don't have ability.<br>
he sends oola to used pile, he wins battle, Lando goes<br>
from my hand using the savrip, Droids are dead, obi 's still there.  <br>
drain for 2.  He gets Vader after obi finally, battle.  I hack, <br>
he draws enough to sack obi for attrition.  Luke with saber, Han <br>
come down, hack Vader, beat him, Full Win.<br>
<br>
FW + 30<br>
<br>
Game 6, Rops Sagan Style vs Justin Cachelin (1664).<br>
<br>
Great.  Final game, and I知 playing my trainee, ride, friend,<br>
and all around moron.  Same decks as earlier, and he beat me then.<br>
Looking at my differential compared to other peoples, I知 guaranteed<br>
to be in the top 2...  Everybody knows we're both from Kamloops,<br>
and some bug us about not rigging the game :)  Not the type<br>
of thing I壇 do any ways.  Well game starts.<br>
<br>
He gets his Obi hut Tosche station start, I pull a site.<br>
he activates 5, EPP obi goes to his hut for 4 (bad feeling),<br>
moves to Tosche station.  I activate, Lt. Arnet comes down<br>
in Tempest scout 1.  Battle.  I'm immune to his attrition,<br>
obi dead.  His turn, he deploys another obi to the hut,<br>
moves over.  I drop an at-st pilot in tempest scout 1,<br>
battle.  I pull a 3, +2 attrition due to my pilots, I知 immune.<br>
Obi gone again.  his turn, he drops obi straight to Tosche<br>
station, battle.  Tempest Scout 6 reacts from hand, obi is lost<br>
AGAIN, tempest scout 6 goes for attrition.  I flip my object,<br>
and he drops Ben after tempest scout 1 AGAIN, determined to kill him.<br>
battle, I add a total of 3 to destiny, 2 to attrition, so Ben<br>
is gone guaranteed.  He pulls a 4, sack my AT-ST pilot.  So<br>
the smoke clears, 4 obis in the lost pile, and tempest scout1<br>
and LT. Arnet still sitting pretty.  Bit more stuff happens,<br>
I drain him out.<br>
<br>
FW + 26.<br>
<br>
final score: 12 (+160)<br>
<br>
and so, I did win!   I really enjoyed this tournament,<br>
almost every game, required heavy thought on my part, and<br>
even though I won by a extremely large margin, all games<br>
were challenging.  <br>
I got to meet the Teacher, and we played an unofficial game<br>
afterwards.  <br>
<br>
Game 7: Rops, Sagan Style vs Charles Hickey's Evasive profit.<br>
<br>
Well, hmmm... I had once seen this deck on the net, but<br>
it was over a month ago.  Plus, I壇 NEVER played against<br>
a profit deck before.<br>
<br>
I go, pull a site, drop a 2/0.  His is similar.  My turn,<br>
drop Tempest scout 2, Watts, and Marquand to his Jabba's Palace.  <br>
He drops master luke, Ben, and Boussh.  Mechanical Failure.<br>
I pull a 4 and 5, he loses Boussh and luke, revives luke, I sack<br>
watts Marquand.  I go for my flip with the occasional attempt and battling.<br>
Vader goes after Master Luke, Master luke hacks Vader, then<br>
plays clash of sabers.  Battle over, Vaders dead.  DAMN!  or<br>
narrow escape stuff.  Fallen Portal.  you name it.  He's only draining<br>
for a bit, zuckuss goes up to kashyyyk to increase my drains.<br>
Igar and Tempest 1 come over to tatooine to play a bit, he<br>
narrow escapes.  Evax and Cabbel jump in Tempest Scout 2, which<br>
is still empty, and hike it over to the mechanical Failure, and<br>
get rid of it.  Igar and Tempest scout 2 chase his guys around a bit,<br>
Boussh comes to Ralltir, meditation, leia's gun.  damn !<br>
I drop Mara against Boussh, he shoots the Scout walker, and Misses!<br>
hurray!  dust clears, Mara hits my lost, Boussh hits his lost.<br>
he ends up battling Igar and company, he plays a destiny adder,<br>
pulls a 6, 5, 4.  Tempest Scout 2 is all alone, again.  At the<br>
end, he drains me out.  <br>
<br>
FL -2.<br>
<br>
Close game.  Damn close game.  After playing his deck, I learned<br>
something though.  Don't go to jabba's palace without good forces<br>
cause of master luke.  Also, add in Ability Ability Ability.<br>
<br>
<br>
The next day, after being home, Justin and I match our other<br>
decks up against each other.  We always do this when we don't<br>
play in a tourney.  I expected a loss, knowing his dark side<br>
style, and I wasn't disappointed.  Loss by 20.  Although,<br>
in some ways, it wasn't so bad.  I'd bet if we played 10 games,<br>
it would go about 5 - 5.<br>
<br>
Great Tournament, and I'm planning on hitting the Continental.<br>
I might Also consider going to the Grand Slam in Portland..<br>
Maybe I'll see Teacher there again.<br>
<br>
A large thank you to Doug Taylor, for running a smooth tournament.<br>
Also a thank you Charles 'Teacher' Hickey for the game afterwards,<br>
and to James I think was the name.  Both Charles and James<br>
helped out at the tourney, answering rules questions, setting<br>
up games.  Also, Thank you very much to Hyerplight Enterprises<br>
for the location.<br>
