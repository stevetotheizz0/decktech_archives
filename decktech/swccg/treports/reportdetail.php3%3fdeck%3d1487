For LS i made a imitation machine killer with retrival and fallen portals, Dark was MKOS scum with myo and like 3 abyssins.  i haven&#146;t played a single game of starwars in almost two months since worlds, so i have no idea how I&#146;m gonna do.<br>
<br>
Game 1: LS vs Mike Raveling (2050)<br>
<br>
Mike is playing Imperial Command BHBM.  i know he has at least 6 imperial commands which isn&#146;t good for me since my entire space fleet consistes of just the superfalcon.  he gets emperor to the DSII docking bay and pulls executor from reserve with Mob points.  for the first few turns all we do is pull out docking bays and set up.  eventually he throws down lord vader at a endor drain 2 site, so i pull jedi luke from reserve to home 1 DB and move him to CC db.  he puts u-3p0 down there with luke and i move luke to tatooine DB.  the next turn when i started to drain i realized he had ATWYS x2 in his deck so i don&#146;t drain... and i can&#146;t move Luke back to H1 db to drain because then Your destiny would be hitting me for 3 a turn.  so he&#146;s draining me for 2 a turn and i&#146;m doing no damage, but because of my ICBW and retrival its not a big deal, sometime in the middle of this i manage to grab his Imperial command, i also out of commisions Vader from his lost pile, which means he can&#146;t play rise my friend to take vader back to his hand &#146;cos he couldn&#146;t deploy him again.  Mike is only activating 12 a turn now so its hard for him to do anything big.  he eventually puts down kashyyyk and zuckuss with ozzel, just the opening i was looking for, so my turn comes down capt. han falcon and leia, battle, he doesn&#146;t have a Imp. command in hand so he loses everything and i drop Leg. Starfighter on the falcon. I also get out melas and tawss with Luke at tatooine DB and since the average destiny in his deck is around 3 i felt safe draining with them, but he plays ATWYS and draws a 4 so lukes missing.  so i drop Honor, Ben with saber, take a damage during his turn and find luke the next.  he doesn&#146;t have enough force to drop executor with a admiral, battle and play imp command (he has like 3 stacked) all in the same turn, so he just drops executor with some guy and moves over to dagobah, next turn moving back to kashyyyk, i battle and he does have an imp command this time so i lose leia to bacta tank and some force, and i move the falcon to dagobah to hide.  at this point he&#146;s draining me for 4 a turn, i&#146;m draining for 2 and making him lose 2 for leg. starfighter, he tries to deploy a couple more drain 2 endor sites and spread out but recurring leia from the tank eliminates almost all of his guys.  i&#146;m retriving a little but i can&#146;t get it going in a loop &#146;cos some of my on the edges are stuck on the bottom of the lost pile.  Win by 19 or something close to that.<br>
<br>
Game 2: DS vs Rich Jeffery (1600?)<br>
<br>
he starts TIGIH and i start MKOS with Jabba&#146;s palace.  I notice he forgot to pull JK luke and saber to chief chirpa&#146;s hut to start but i don&#146;t say anything, i figure if a couple of turns into the game he realizes he doesn&#146;t have luke out, i&#146;m not gonna let him take it back.  but just before i start activating to start the game he says, oops i forgot luke and i let him go get it... but Rich does something that really pisses me off, he puts his entire opening hand back into his reserve deck, pulls Luke and his saber, and then shuffles and draws a new opening hand... I notices this as he is drawing his new 8 cards and i&#146;m pissed as hell because he basically just got to look at his opening hand, and then he put them back and drew a new hand.  I&#146;m tempted to @#$% and moan because of this but i decide he&#146;s got no chance of beating me anyways so i let it slide, but if i catch him doing it again i&#146;ll have to shove my foot up his ass.  so we start and i get JPSD jabba out at the chamber from hand.  second turn jabba&#146;s sail barge and the 2-0 sail barge site and galid from reserve.  his turn he moves JK luke over to the docking bay and drops a couple guys at my Desert heart.  so i drop a couple guys at the desert heart but he barriers both, but i figure it don&#146;t matter &#146;cos they can&#146;t move away so i move my Sail Barge over, his turn he drops a couple more guys at the desert heart, midge with JK luke, and LS prof on luke, he battles at desert heart and plays take the initiative and the one card that lets him subtract 3 from my destiny.  fett and iggy both try to hit his COK but i keep drawing a 3 so i miss. so we both lose a guy or something and he pays 8 force to move COK and other scrub into my sail barge site.  i start spreading out more within Jabba&#146;s palace and flip my objective, and i move Iggy and 4-lom into the sail barge.  his turn he drains me for 6 total and drops an ithorian with JK luke.  my turn i kill off his guys in the sail barge but can&#146;t really do any battle damage.  but i&#146;m draining for 7 a turn now (2 at each of my 3 JP sites and one at desert heart).  he drains me for 5 on his turn and i table a Myo to cancel it. next turn myo comes down and goes to fight his guys at the endor DB, i retrive 3 he loses 1 and i ghhk and throw myo back into my used, he gets a couple of drains of 5 in but it doesn&#146;t matter as I drain for 7 and i&#146;m cancelling his drain every couple turns, win by 25.<br>
<br>
Game 3: LS vs Josh Grace (2000)<br>
<br>
well since i left Minnesota after this summer josh has been winning most of the important tournaments, including the Grand Slam, so i&#146;m looking forward to this matchup.  He starts old school with Jabba&#146;s palace and ETE.  first turn he pulls out all the JP sites, my turn i get enough force to deploy JK luke to my tatooine DB and move him over to Jabba&#146;s Palace because i&#146;m not sure if he&#146;s playing none shall pass or not.  his turn he monnoks me lost and gets rid of a couple of On the Edges, which really hurt.  he also deploys Mara and her saber at the cantina.  we trade the drains of 2 and 3 for a couple turns and then he pulls out gailid to JP, miyoom and fett there too.  so my turn i get out CC DB, put Capt. han and epp leia there, move them over to Tatooine DB.  he kept losing his scanning crews from hand because i have 4 shocking infos in my deck and i think he knew because the first game i was shocking one of Mike&#146;s scomp links every turn.  but he goes ahead and miyooms me i shock miyoom but he gets rid of a JK luke in my hand, he saw that i had fallen portal x2 and anakins saber x2 so he monnoks lost and gets ride of those. my turn i drop order to engage, move JK luke over to the entrance cavern, and move han/leia over to JP.  his turn hes draining me for 5 or so and he drops a couple guys and fights JK luke, he can&#146;t hit him and i draw a 5 so we&#146;re even on power and he has to lose a couple guys from the site, after that he just moves them away to the audience chamber.  my turn i drain and draw into a battle plan and a kessel.  on his turn he deploys a couple scrubs each to his 1-0 JP sites, now during one of the battles we had i put lando with ax on the bacta tank, i figure he forgot lando was a spy and i could get a beat down. so i pay 10 force total to put lando down with a CC engineer, but he Hutt smooches so lando goes back to my hand... so i put out battle plan to try to limit his drains.  his turn he drains me for about 5 more and moves his guys together and consolidates.  we&#146;re both sitting on about a dozen force left.  my turn i drop kessel from hand, falcon and lando with ax there, tawss with mara and takes her out with a 5.  his turn he can pay and drain me for 4, but i get to drain for 7 and i don&#146;t have to pay for it. and then i move my JK luke to block his drain at the AC.  he battles me so he doesn&#146;t have to lose 3 for OTE but i manage to draw a 6 for destiny, which means i track it next turn, and right before i drain him out i on the edge and get 5 back, win by 13.<br>
<br>
Game 4: DS vs Garret Larson<br>
<br>
Well this game was over in 5 min. He starts with just JP Audience Chamber. First turn i convert his chamber and drop Jabba there.  his turn he gets out tatooine docking bay with insurrection.  my turn out comes Sail barge with the 2-0 sail barge site.  his turn he drops tawss at tatooine docking bay to try to get more activation with Staging area.  my turn i drop merc. pilot on the sail barge, ephant mon on the sail barge site. and move them over to the docking bay.  his turn he tries to find another docking bay so he could run away, but he couldn&#146;t find one left in his deck.  If he moves away to desert heart he can&#146;t move from there, so he drops another scrub to back up tawss.  my turn out comes fett, dengar and iggy on the sail barge and bib from reserve.  battle, hit both his guys and draw 5 total for destiny, buby 16 force off the top for him.  i then just spread out and drain all over jabba&#146;s palace, win by 26<br>
<br>
so all in all i felt pretty good coming back to minnesota, beating two 2000 players and winning the tournament.  <br>
