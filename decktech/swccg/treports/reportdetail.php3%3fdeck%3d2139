<br>
Well states is just around the corner and I still have no dark deck.  I do not want to play MKOS, BHBM, Huntdown because I figure those will be the decks people try to counter.  So I go to the supreme starwars page on the net  -decktech- and read some state tourney reports.  I read a couple reports about people playing against kyle craft&amp;#8217;s ties w/ tallon rolls and star destroyers and I like the idea so I build a deck and it seems pretty solid&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;.only played two games with it and it won both so dark deck is done.<br>
<br>
Now light side is the problem and I have two decks WYS piece of jizz deck that only wins half the time I play with it and a RTP deck that has gone undefeted in three tourneys and has only lost one time playtesting.  So ultimately I decide to go with the piece of jizz WYS deck because I am a scub.<br>
<br>
Well the night before the tourney is the fabulous day of 4-20 you know hitlers b-day smokers new year and all that jazz.  So my roommate and a few friend decide that they want to celebrate so when I come home from work it looks like they set off a smoke bomb or something.  And how exactly am I supposed to build starwars decks in all this smoke.   So fellow P.O.W. teammate Mike Peralta is over and he is celebrating this fabulous day with my roommate.  I drive to his house to pick up his brother, D.J. , who then informes we that we need to pick up Justin Ryan and build some decks for him to play tommorrow.  When I arrive back at my house some of the smoke has cleared, now it only looks like a slightly foggy day in the northwest.  <br>
<br>
We start to playtest around 7:00pm and I call up a few people from the area to see if they are going to states and they are not but one guy Carlito lets me borrow two emperors the destiny 6 daddy for my dark and a few tallon roll combos the only catch being I have to drive to bremerton the slum town about 15 min away&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;.no prob&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;Me, D.J., Justin, and my dog a pit bull hop in my car and start our trek to b-town&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;b-town is a sailors town filled with bremelos  --if you have ever heard sir-mix-a lot&amp;#8217;s song bremelo you would know what I am talking about&amp;#8212;and it looks like a slum.  Well we get the emperors scare some people with my dog and start the drive back to my house but since I forgot about some road construction and the detours the normal 30-40 min drive took about a hour, then we had to stop by justins house to ask his mom for some money and <br>
ask if he could stay at my house&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;let me tell you justins mom is a &amp;#8211;milf- if you have seen american pie you will know what I am talking about&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;well after all the bull @#$% we get bac to my house about 10:00-10:30 play test build justin some decks and get to sleep about  3:00 or so&amp;#8230;..the Peralta bros left about 12-1 in the morning&amp;#8230;.<br>
<br>
Day of States&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;..<br>
<br>
I wake up about 7:30 w about 70 punds of pitbull lying on me&amp;#8230;.damn dog&amp;#8230;..so I get up and take my shower then wake justin up so he can get ready we leave my house about 8:00 stop by starbucks so justin can get a coffe or crappacchino or whatever and talk to the cute girls behind the counter then we leave go get some gas and head over to the peralta&amp;#8217;s brothers house to complete team P.O.W.<br>
The ride over to Brokengames sucks it normally takes about a hour and 10 mins or something this time it took about 1 house and 45 mins or so lots of traffic&amp;#8230;..we listened to a bit of sevendust, corrossion of conformity, deftones and some linkin park&amp;#8230;.we were ready&amp;#8230;..<br>
<br>
We arrive at the store hardly anyone is there we pay our 5 buck fill out deck lists were told not to talk @#$% or we would be dq ed.  So we proceded to trash talk like always&amp;#8230;..such as asking random kids how their mom was after last night and other stuff like that&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;..well eventually team 31337 or team scrub showed up&amp;#8230;..that team consits of Joe Olson, Matt Bryant, Josh something and they had some tibbles guy as their honorary member&amp;#8230;..team P.O.W. was gonna kick their asses&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;.<br>
<br>
Team P.O.W. is Mike Fortman (me), Mike Peralta (2000 WA states runner up), DJ Peralta, and Justin Ryan (occasional non-scrub)<br>

<br>
There were 49 people in attendance<br>
Torney report starts now.<br>
<br>
Game 1: My Dark Vs. Mike Mikalian (sp) WYS w/ nightfall<br>
<br>
I start Mob points, SSPFT, and Combat Response the same I would all tourney.  He starts some thing (cant remember must be all the smoke in my house from yesterday).  My hand has no Imp Command, Emperor, Merrijk or Piett so I activate deploy two systems from hand look for the Executor and draw all.  His turn he searches for a protocal droid a docking bay and plays how did we get into this mess and drops 2 2/0 sites im a little scared right now  (before this game my team said this guy was real good and I would probably loose &amp;#8211; thanks team) I have no idea what to expect.<br>
<br>
Well after a few turns I have the emperor at the ds:db the executor w/ Adm. Cheerio out and he has the Falcon with crappy han and the Ourrider w/ dash and wedge abord.  So on my turn I deploy balck 2 w/ DS-61-2 and tallon roll the falcon, lat damage the outrider deploy zuckass and the devestator battle and clear the site I then move to some sytems to get some good drains started.  His turn he deployed nightfall and tones of spies to tatooine at the cantina and dockingbay.  My turn I deploy arica to the cantina and say go.  Well nothing happened for a few turns he drains for 1 well I drain for a lot.  Finally he deploys corran Horn to cantina but forgets to break arica&amp;#8217;s cove and then I forget to move her.  His next turn he breaks her cover but I drain him out next turn.<br>
<br>
FW 2(+29) I think<br>
<br>
Pros: Kicking the crap out of the outrider and tallon rolling the falcon deck working good<br>
Cons: almost getting a beating in the cantina<br>
<br>
Well we finish our game real early so I go outside to see Mike Mikalian outside so we discussed our game a bit until D.J. comes out and starts YO-YO ing (he is the yo-yo master).  Well team P.O.W. does good winning all its games sao we are 4-0 while our rivals team 90210 or whatever had to play eachother so they are 2-2<br>
<br>
Game 2: My Pile of Jizz Vs. Kieth Watabyashi (sp) ISB Space<br>
<br>
I beat Kieth at last years states and he remembers it so he wants revenge.  His deck I think would be a cross between Brian Hunters and Joe Olsons ISB space.  Well first tun he does Piett Merrijk to Executor db and deploys a planet.  My opening had has 2 Jedi luke 2 lando and crap so I go to look for a d-bay and nothing so first tun he gets to look at my deck and gets a weird look on his face.  Well on his next turn he deployes executor w/ 3 pilots and draws uses masterful move grabs monnok and plays lost.  Great by luke, lando and fallen portal.  So my turn I deploy dockingbays  mirax and tallon to tat db and red 10 w/ matching pilot to tatooine w/ xwing cannon.  On his turn he deploys Tempest 1 and Blizzard 1 to the tat db no fallen portal for me clears the site and he looses a walker.  My turn I deploy chewi and han to the db, deploy menace fades and clear off his walker move to cantina.<br>
<br>
In the mean time he is draining at endor and sullest and has a big force of guys.  Well basically we drained each other until he attacked wedge in ship w/ Thrawn, Chimera and zuckuss w/ outerrim scout.  I shot down zuckuss played power pivot and drew a five he drew low so wedge stayed and he lost a few.  Well on my turn I attacked again and had to loose wedge to attrition he had to loose thrawn.  Had wedge stayed I would have established board control (I would have been able to drain for more than him and maybe have one the game) well he drops some guys at endor db  since I have no hand and 5d6 to cantina to stop drains.  My turn I SATM 5d6 move some guys to tat:db and draw a few.  Well he dosent have to pay for drains anymore so he has force to deploy more ships and u3po to cantina.  The game ends when I forget to move luke in red5 away from the executor and another stardestroyer.  So on his turn he battles and me being the scrub that I am play out of nowhere from lost pile instead of waiting and playing hojix.  <br>
<br>
FL &amp;#8211;12<br>
Standing  2(+17)<br>
<br>
Pros: he played a good game<br>
Cons: I lost  and playing the wrong interrupt from the lost pile to loose the game<br>
<br>
Lunch break comes now and I find out that all of team P.O.W. lost their second game while team 315687412356585 won all their games putting them at 6-2 to our 4-4&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;.damn its not looking good for thr P.O.W.s&amp;#8230;..so we decide to go get some terriyaki.  On the way we run into team Ewok Village (Charles Hickey, Mike Mikalian, Derek Snook their other member was missing) Charles is trying to get ahead of us and beat us to the terriyaki joint and because he is bigger than me I let him go in front.  Well after our meal we head back to the store do a little hacky-sacking and yo-yo ing till round three starts.<br>
<br>
Well round three I end up in the scrub room which is kind of weird I thought buy hey ill only be here for 1 round I figure.  Well im playing light against a rallops deck when I look at my card and it says 2(-17) instead of 2(+17) so I call over the tourney director and they have to redo almost every thing.  Well when they get it figured out I end up back downstairs facing none other than Charles Hickey.<br>
<br>
My pile of Jizz Vs. Charles Hickey Huntdown <br>
<br>
Well this game sucked ass&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;.second turn he gets down lord vader w/ whacker and draws.  My turn I get down Jedi Luke w/ Whacker and move to tat:db draw.  His turn Emperor, Janus, Sim to ds:db move vader to tat:db pull I have you know and plays monnok used.   Since I know have a pile of jizz for a hand I deploy smuggler to cantina and one to tat:db flip objective and move smuggler to cantina leaving luke to face vaders wrath.  His turn he deploys Xizor and Guri to cantina Sims me and leaves the destiny there.  He battles luke I play fallen portal from lost pile because I know my destiny is low and I miss he swings at me and misses, I swing at vader draw a 5 and 0 so I miss I draw a 4 for destiny and he play I Have you now draw like a 6 5 and 3 or something so I loose luke and some cards&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;he then battles at the cantina I draw a 5 and he draws something I loose a smuggler and he looses guri. He then moves xizor over to Vaders site.  Well he drained away as I looked for some space or another luke to deploy.  I finally got luke  and han w/ blaster down but he just ingored them and drained me out for the win<br>
<br>
FL &amp;#8211;12 ?<br>
Standing 2(+7)<br>
<br>
Pros: playing a pretty good game against a good player<br>
Cons: the Pile of Jizz that is my light deck<br>
<br>
Team P.O.W. has suffered more looses while them 98765 scores have escaped my memory  getting hazy (damn 4-20)<br>
While now I have officially made it to the scrub room and get to sit next to Mike Peralta as we prepare for game 4<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
My Dark Vs. Some Guys WYS<br>
<br>
First turn I draw. His turn He draws.  My turn deploy Piett get Merrijk the Planet man and deploy some systems.  His turn Cappy Han on Falcon to Kasyyyk  and wedge on Ship to Kasyyyk.  My turn Black 4 w/ DS-61-4 to Kasyyk tallon roll falcon lat damage wedge, tallon roll wedge, deploy executor to fondor move to Kasyyk.  His turn draws.  My turn Emperpr to cantina, admiral cheerio to executor  and draw a few.  His turn deploy ralltiir  2 YT freighters w/ 2 Ralltiir capt. On each.  My turn I drain and wait.  His turn kessel run targeting a capt.  Mirax on her ship to tatooine along w/ crappy han on falcon again, and moves yts to kessel.  My turn DS-61-2 to Tatooine tallon roll falcon, lat damage pulser skate Chimera w/ Thrawn and zuckuss in Mist Hunter.  Battle game over. <br>
<br>
FW +29<br>
Standings 4(+36)<br>
<br>
Pros: dark deck being a machine<br>
Cons: none really deck worked great<br>
<br>
This is the round that really sucks after our game im bull-@#$%tin with some guys when Joe Olson comes out and says hes dropping out of the tourney because he lost 2 games and cant win (what a @#$%) so after some convincing he decides not to drop and that&amp;#8217;s when we find out that honorary member of team 696969 tibbles as been DQ-ed for having a incorect decklist (after going 4-0) so now there is only 2 undefeated players in the tourney and we start game 5.<br>
<br>
Game 5 <br>
My Pile of Jizz Vs. Joe Olson Agents of the Black Sun<br>
I was trying to build a deck like this but couldn&amp;#8217;t get ahold of enough emperors to build it.  Anyways we start the game and my pile of jizz never lets me down with the opening hand  3x OOC/TT, 2x Chewis, 2x Fallen Portal and a Dash.  He<br>
deploys couracant dbay and move xizor there and draws. My turn I draw.  His turn a vigo to xizors site and dengar w/ presence to ds:db moves xizor there.  My turn I put Chewi protector and dash to the ds:db to stop the drain of three and draw and get a some ships.  His turn dengar and iggy and guri to the db and battle me I fallen portal xizor he captures dash and singe I had canceled dengars text I loose chewi and a few.  I play 2 of my OOC/TT to place the dark prince out of play.  Well that would be the only good thing I did all game.   I go to space I die I go to the ground I die.  I have no cards left I die.<br>
<br>
FL  -23<br>
Standings 4(+13)<br>
<br>
Pros: placing Xizor OOP<br>
Cons: The Pile of Jizz that is my light deck<br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
My Dark Vs. Mike Peraltas Jedi Testing<br>
<br>
Damn playing a member of team P.O.W&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;this game sucked I deployed systems drained beatup on dash in space beat up on luke and orrimako at the docking bay and finally drained him out by 26.<br>
<br>
FW +26<br>
Final Standing 6(+39)<br>
<br>
Well I scrubed out at states and so did team P.O.W. and our rival team 37337337337133711 beat us.  Doug Harvilla won the swiss style tourney and I heard that nick Jones won the Final.  Im not sure because I left before that.  <br>
<br>
Before we left we did play card wars (Hickey this is my game) If you read Hickeys report he descibed it.  Basically to take your @#$%ty prize support cards hold them on edge and take turns trying to slice your opponents card in half with your card.  As easy as this sounds there are rules.<br>
<br>
1. No Foil Cards allowed (unless both players have agreed to both use foil cards)<br>
2. Cards must be of different side (no light-light or dark-dark wars)<br>
3. May only grip a small corner while on the attack.<br>
4. Defender must use two hands to hold card.<br>
5. Attack can only be made in a down word motion (no under attacks)<br>
6. If you break any of these rules you are left to the mercy of your opponent<br>
<br>
Well any ways I usually am the card wars master but after severly damaging a cloud city trooper my Treva Horme slide himself in half on the attack and then I proceeded to loose another 3 games straight.  Well after our little game of card wars a bunch of younger scrubs started up the trend as we exited the building. And to finish the day were were greeted by the song &amp;#8220;Im a Looser Baby&amp;#8221; by Beck on our ride home.<br>
<br>
Until next time, <br>
