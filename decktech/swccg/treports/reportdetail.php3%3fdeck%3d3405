<br>
i have been play testing a few weeks leading up to this tournament.my decks are senate for dark,and senate for light.<br>
<br>
somewhere along the line i come home,and see the family cat staring at me with this evil look on his face.i look down and see a darth vader DLOTS torn up.i am mad at him at this point.i decide to play test a game with him because he wants to try out his new vader.he puts down cader,and i was using wys so i dropped 3 smugglers on his dlots and kicked the @#$% out of him.he runs off with his tail tucked between his legs.<br>
<br>
friday night before the tourny,shaun clarke,james corder,and i decide to go over to kirk&#146;s to play some.i arrive 1st,and james and shaun show up about an hour later.as soon as james and shaun arrive like 5 cats come out of the wood work,and start nosing around.they are sniffing our card boxes,and nosing around in them.they then sit there and watch us play a few games.i swear those cats scout out our decks for kirk.anyways we come up with pretty broken bhbm deck,that i want james to use.he refuses,so shaun puts it together.he stomps out my qmc,and decides he likes it.he tells james i think you missed the boat here.he dicides he likes it,and is gona use it.since he can&#146;t palytest on saturday i make him loan it to me,so i can see how it does.<br>
<br>
saturday night,the night before the tourny i meet up with david brinson at the game preserve.we got back to my place to play test.we make some trades,and he puts together this profit racing deck.we play a few games,and it gets stomped out.i change like 20 cards and then check out his huntdown.it is good,and i make a few minor changes to it.kirk shows up,and he is gona hang out and play for awhile.he decides he isn&#146;t gona play the next day because his cats must have told him about our decks,and he was scared.so he plays david a few games,and then david and i start playing.kirk watches for awhile,and then passes out on my floor.david and i go pick up tony around 2 in the morning,and we stop at this gas station for some munchies.there is a note on the door,and it says brb in 3 mins.we are like wtf,so we decide to wait a few.some dude shows up to deliver the news papers,and he trys to open it and it is locked.he mutter&#146;s sometihng like what the @#$% and throws the papers down and leaves.then this dude lets us in to get some food.he says something about having to lock up when he needs to use the bathroom.he musta been taking a dump or something.we get back to my place,and tony is talking about this hidden base deck he wants to play.he makes a few trades,and borrows a few cards and throws it together.i try out the turbo bhbm deck,i win 2 out of 3,and we change tony&#146;s deck around some.he then proceeds to smash me out like 4 in a row.we try and get ahold of joe mornout,and joe is like i cant come because i have to stay with this chick because she is scared because some one broke into her house.he assures me he will be at the tournament.so i get bored of tony kicking my butt at wars,so we pop in some wwf royal rumble on my super nintendo.i keep using the undertaker because he looks funny,and i keep running around the rung.finally i get tired of undetaker so i run at this group of like 3 guys fighting in the ring,and one of them throws me out.we pass the control back and forth for awhile.davind has been asleep for like 2 hours,and i wake him up and tell him someing about us leaving.kirk wakes up(we had moved him onto my bed because we wanted to paly test)and kirk heads home to shower.i am glad he finally woke up because he sounds like a damn chainsaw when he snores.dave heads to the bathroom while tony and i paly a few more games.like 20 mins later dave comes out of the bathroom.next thing i know i am trying to use the bathroom so i can dump out the rest of my beverage,but my mom is in there.she says something about cleaning up water,and i give dave hell for flooding the toilet.he denys it of course,but he used the bathroom like 30 times,and tony and i used it once each.my mom tells me to put new toilet paper in there so i grab one,and when i go to put it in i can barely keep from passing out.the smell is horid coming out of the bathroom.tony asks dave if he had a double whopper for dinner because he put the toilet out of order.dave is embaraced and i finally am able to stick the toielt paper in there.my mom comes to the door of my room,and says it wasnt poor dave,i left the stink in there.i am like mom wtf,it smells like a dead animal in there.we all laugh.we head to the car,and i decide to go change cloths.claytin atkins and i were talking about superstitions,and i said well as far back as i remember i always had the same shirt on when i won tournys.so i decided to wear a different shirt to see how i would fair.as i pass the bathroom i smell that stinch again,and i pull the door shut.after i change i walk by the door again,and can still smell the stinch.so i run down the stairs as fast as i can,because the stinch scares me.<br>
<br>
we decide to stop by mcdonalds cause tony is hungry.he orders some food,and a coffee.he also wants alot of sugar.dave gets him like 10 sugars,but tony isnt satisfied.awww well.<br>
<br>
we get to the tourny and steve horton is there,and says he is running it instead of carlos.carlos is lazy these days,and acts like he likes star wars but he doesnt even paly anymore.so people start arriving.with about 10 mins left still no kent,shawn,and joe.i call joe and he wont even answer the phone now.i look out and see 2 people walking towards the shop.when they get clsoer i see that it is richard rivenburg.i havent seen this guy in over 2 years,and he tells me he just showd up to kick my @#$% for old times.kent and shawn finally show up also.so horton will have to play because we have 9 people.i give him tdigwatt,and wys to use.we have no extra shields so i stick a dtf/battle plan,and a 1st strike/battle order in.and we are set to go.joe never shows up so we have 10.tony mornout,david brinson,richard rivenburg,rich&#146;s friend,shaun clarke,james corder,kent saylor,shawn nichter,steve horton,and me.<br>
<br>
they start to do pairings,and i find out i have to play my play testing partner shaun 1st game.<br>
<br>
game 1:my dark senate Vs shaun clarke&#146;s lsc<br>
<br>
i start out 1st turn with lott dod,and aks mo for the flip.he draws a 7/5 for the race.his 1st he jsut picks up.my next turn i drop the senate hover cam,and he geta a 5/5 on the race.he drops down obi wan jk,and gives him a combat card.my turn i pull sidious with lott dod,and drop him at the senate and move him to the jedi council chamber.i lsoe 6 for the race.his turn he drops qui gon with the 5 destiny stick.i drop down maul,battle,cut qui gon,and use sidious to do away with him.next turn i drop vader agaisnt ben,battler,cut,and sidious does away with ben.i have ability x 3 out,and all he has in his hand is jk luke.so he drops him at one of his sites.i drop another maul,battler,cut,and sidious does away with luke.i forgot to play i have you now,or game may have been over.he drops lando,and yoda to one of his sites.i drop maul again,battle,cut,and sidious does away with yoda.so now all he has left in his deck is lando because all his other people are out of play.so he drops lando,and p 59 kills pando.he ends up losing for triple a,and a drain from my dre and panda b combo.fl by 15 or so<br>
2+(15)<br>
<br>
highs:sidious placing all of his people except lando out of play<br>
lows:having to play shaun 1st game,losing the race on turn 3<br>
<br>
game 2: my gungan senate Vs shawn nichter&#146;s dark combat<br>
<br>
he get a pretty slow draw,and i played we&#146;sa got a grand army the 1st 3 turns to pull the chamber,battle plains,and fambaa.he gets maul down second turn so he can drain.on my 4th turn i have like everything out.i have 2 gungans at the plains,with the energy shield,i have senate flipped with mas amedda there,and i have home one at coruscant with haash&#146;n.menace fades and battle order are killing him,so he drops a chimera crew.i kill thrawn and thrawns copilot(cant remember that dudes name)and i forget to put ackbar down.next turn he drops zuckass and battler,i get no destiny but overpower him by 2.my next i put ackbar,he barriers,but i still get destiny.so i kill both his ships.how he has to pay to drain the rest of the game,and i am retrieivng 4 a turn,from amidala,and the wookie senater.after a few turns i drain him out.fl by 26<br>
4+(41)<br>
<br>
highs:the gungans working well,doing there thing<br>
lows:he didnt appear to get a good draw<br>
<br>
game 3:my gungan senate Vs shaun clarke&#146;s turbo bhbm<br>
<br>
alright this sucks.i have to play shaun again,and this bhbm is a beast.so far i have played against all shaun/shawn&#146;s-lol.he is a bum and doesnt put the back door out all game,so i am getting very little force.i odnt get we&#146;sa got a grand amry till turn 3,and he gets a fast draw.2nd turn use puts out blizzard 4 and pulls lord vader.so on my turn i check my deck for my cards i can pull,and boss nass isnt in there.i look for luke to give him,also not in there.so i need force so i put out boss&#146;s hut anyways.he makes me lose 3 for no luke,and drops maul,and moves into the hut.i drop luke at endor db,and get onto gunga entrance,and put tarpols out.i huddel my guys up at the onta gunga entrance,cause maul is a beast.vader comes and grabs luke,and heads towards the ds2 so he can make me lsoe some force.maul is stuck at boss nass&#146;s hut because tarpols wont let him move to underwater sites.i know i need to get soemthing going or i am gona lose.i have 10 force,and get 10 next turn,so i draw a few,i get a we&#146;sa and stack it on his grabber.pull battle plains,and am done.he duels and i lsoe 3.my next i drop home one at coruscant,and my next i drop the battle plains,fambaa,mas amedda to the senate(where amidala,wookie senater,and horax ryyder are waiting.and i move 2 gungans to the plains.i am now making him lose about 5 a turn,and i actually win a few duels.blizzard 4 walks back over and sits onfront of the gungans.it is a clsoe race,but i retrieve 2 a turn,and it is enoguh to push me over the top.fl by 13<br>
6+(54)<br>
<br>
highs:gungans are ruff!!!<br>
lows:having to play shaun 2 of 1st 3<br>
<br>
we all decide to go to wendys for lunch.we pile up tony,david,shaun,james,and i in james explorer.shawn nichter and kent go in kent&#146;s care.it is a race to wendys because they never have enough nuggets to go around.we get there 1st,but we cant find a spot so kent and nichter pull in 1st.we get out and run for the door,and barely beat them in.luckily they had nuggets for all of us.we eat and shoot the @#$% for awhile.kent starts talking about some crazy @#$%,and we are all sitting there staring at him.he finally realizes we are staring at him,and he gets all red in the face.we all finish up and head back to the gp.<br>
<br>
game 4: my dark senate Vs david brinson&#146;s pod profit<br>
<br>
i had the absolutely worst draw.i dont see lott dod till like turn 10.1st turn i check my deck and see all 3 lott,and all 3 squabble in it.so i dont draw.next turn i look again,and i count 5 of them,so i draw.well guess what,i miss counted and drew none.so now i am like @#$% it.he jsut saves force and draws.i flip with 3 random senaters,because i dont even have a guy with blockade in hand.he drops a crew to the audience chamber,but doesnt free han.i drop mauk,dre and battle.i swing at ben,cut,and opperate.he trys to exclude dre with lando,misses.i swing at epp luke,cut,opperate.he trys to draw 2 destiny,but i point at some goofy senater and say he only gets one.he kills dre,and he loses padme,and naked droid.next turn he drops masta luke,i barrier.he drops qui gon,and battles.maul cuts tawas khaa,and lando,and i play maul strikes.he is immune with qui gon,so he loses 6.he busts han out.so now he has han,luke,and qui gon.i drop vader,battle,cut qui gon,and play i have you now.he kills vader,and clear the site.i draw 1 card,and it is squabble!!!so i pull lott dod out.the race finishes like turn 7,cause he has all one/s on it.i drop lott dod finally.and he drops 2 gusy to the back door.he never retrieves all game cause of chybc.lott is fed up now,and he pulls maul,and sends him to kill the back door crew+a few overflow.david is running out of options,and drops some more guys.lott is reall mad now,and sends maul to whipe him out again.after this david has no people left,and triple a is gona kill him,so he draws up.fl by 20 i think<br>
8+(74)<br>
<br>
highs:killing almost every guy in his deck in 4 battles<br>
lows:lott dod where are you???<br>
<br>
so now tony and i are both undefeated,and all else have lsot 2,so it is him and i last 2 games<br>
<br>
game 5:my dark senate Vs tony mornout&#146;s hidden base<br>
<br>
i dont pull lott again 1st turn,but draw him.he gets mirax out fast,and start having his way with her-hehe.i flip,and get sidious to the generator core and the senater who does direct damage on naboo.he is pulling systems,and dumping out peeps in space.i put out epp vader at back door,and epp maul at his cc db,and drop search nad destroy.yeb yeb is killing his cards,search is hitting him,and drains.he loses naboo off the top(which i later find out is his hidden base)so he drops corran horn,and on the edges.now he is getting mad for losing so many cards,and he drops epp obi on sidous,i barrier.he then drops epp qui gon on sidious,and i barrier him also.he gets mad and quits.i am like wtf,and he says dont be stupid count it up.fl by 29??<br>
10+(103)<br>
<br>
highs:absolutely none,have any of you ever played tony?hehe<br>
lows:him quiting the game<br>
<br>
so i try and talk 2 him after the game,but he is pretty upset.i tell him that no one can win every game.you can&#146;t play a game if you dont expect to lsoe sometimes.awww well.i tried<br>
<br>
game 6: my senate gungans Vs tony mornout dark combat<br>
<br>
he is still prett dejected,and i get total god draw on him.he never pulls his catach card so i jsut abuse my interupts.he doesnt get any jedo down fast,so he just saves force a few turns.finally he puts out thrawn,chimera,intercepter w/ tie guns,and draws a maul.he showed it to me,actually he drew 3 mauls all together!!i set up the gungans at the plains,home one at his carida,a few senaters with mas amedda and amidala.he drops maul and mara on the hut crew for like 20 force.he cuts up boss nass,and rep ben,but he draws a 2 for destiny.i subtract 3,and gungan general lives!!! also the trap is sprung,tarpols makes mara stay at nas&#146;s chamber rest of game,and gungan general runs to the entrance to retrieve one the rest of the game.he is making me lose like 8 a turn,but i cancel one and lose a few,and i am hitting him for 7.i get my once per game for 4,and retrieve a steady 2 a turn,and end up winning by 2.fl by 2<br>
12+(i think i finished at 105)<br>
<br>
highs:going 6-0<br>
lows:poor tony was so dejected<br>
<br>
so i finally went 6-0 at the gp again.it is hard to go 6-0 here cause there is good compitition.we get some theed packs,and i pull a qui gon.i give tony the qui gon to try and cheer him up because i know he needs one.and i we give our commons to richard rivenburg because his newest cards are ds2!!!we all give back everything that is borrowed.kent trades me 2 amidalas,and everyone goes their sperate ways.i go home and wait on tony to finish his tr on here,and then pass out!!!<br>
