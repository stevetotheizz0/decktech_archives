PRE-TOURNY SHNIZ...<br>
<br>
Hello there, campers. tourny report time again. Anyway, after getting some help from Hayes Hunter over the previous 2 weeks (not enough, I&#146;m afraid) via email, we roll around to about a week before the DPC. One of my best friends at work, Bob Twilley, had died in a fire the friday before, and the funeral was that tuesday, so my mind was anywhere but the DPC. I had taken off work on thursday and friday to help my buds in greenville get ready for the DPC. So the weekend before the DPC, right after Bob died, There was a tourny in nearby anderson, at Planet Comics. They have some pretty queer playstyles (actually, most of SC does) but I was confident that I, from Clemson, and 2 of my buds from greenville, who I drove down to anderson, could take them. (Ah, the joys of no word processor...run on sentencing)...Riiiiight. So. Caleb Foth (1613-ish), Robert Seville (featured in another Atlanta report), myself(1733), and Mark Fessler (1480-ish) all meet that friday night to get ready for the local. Mark says he can&#146;t go...work or something, so we play a pickup game while caleb and robert chill. OK, heres where background comes in. I won SC states this year with a SYC Flip. That should be an indication, first off. Anyway, since states, I had remodled the deck, and it was really good (including Atlanta, 22-4, avg. winning differential: +27). It is a very cagey deck...it either wins huge or loses huge. The key flaw is this: If they drop first turn, you will usually lose, if they have any skill. Otherwise, you get into a lock, where you win. period. The only bad matchup, really, is Pile. Ayways, so the deck is TIGHT. Mark, who usually plays QMC, whips out this hidden base garbage, and I smirk. That was Mistake numero uno. I proceeded, despite excellent playing, and few mistakes, to lose, even though there had been no beatdown. The beatdown was in space. I was impressed. My LS at the time was pile, which isn&#146;t fun, and is only about 10 cards different from Hayes&#146;s. I am so impressed by marks deck, I ask to play it, unmodified, the next day at the tournament (Caleb needed a LS deck, and the pile is flawless...well...sorta) So now onto the tourny in Anderson! <br>
<br>
ANDERSON TOURNY...<br>
<br>
Team:<br>
Brad Reinhold: f&#146;d up HB, solid SYC flip<br>
Caleb Foth: Gomer&#146;s Pile, wicked DS Pile<br>
Robert Seville: Tatooine podracing, tatooine beats DS<br>
<br>
We get down there, and there are 2 other greenville players, one of the Thompson brothers and a friend of his. We say high, get ready to play. 2 (only 2!) andersonians show, and then there is the tourny director, so we have 8. <br>
<br>
Game 1: SYC versus Jim Soukup (TD) EBO/racing/mains/sac<br>
<br>
hehe...this should be fun. I start mob points, anti-sac, and million voices. Before I activate, I grab CPI and Kuat, then activate, pull a gunner and drop him to the DB, then draw the rest, getting emperor and DS conference room, and a TIE interceptor to go with the cannon in my hand. Jim sets up quickly, getting EBO going 3rd turn, and moving Dash in Outrider and Capn Han in Falcon to the hoth I played. Meanwhile I&#146;m plodding along towards Hoth. I don&#146;t blow up Alderaan, as I don&#146;t want to lose my immunity to battle damage. My turn, I drop Dark Path, look at the top (there is a 6 there when I&#146;m done), the Tie (he doesn&#146;t barrier...he&#146;s expecting a SD) then after making sure, jokingly, that he doesn&#146;t want to barrier my suicidal tie, I drop the las cannons. He does turn a bit white. Initiate, spend 3 to target the falcon, get the 6, falcon dies, spend 3 to target dash, draw a 4, dash dies, and I have space, saving 3 force just in case. His turn he drops ECC lando and chewie prot against my lone gunner at the db, he battles, I lose the gunner, then play PASOA to get it back to hand. My turn, I play PASOA used targeting chewie, drain for one, drop choke vader, initiate, choke lando, so hes sitting theretaking it. chewie dies, and the DS moves onward, with vader backing up the ds conference room. I now have 3 gunners + emperor at conference room + vader, so I Path, place a 5, then CPI to kill his planet. YA-HOOOOOOO! Damn it feels good...rest of game consistes of me lateral damaging luke on red 5 then dropping chimaera + thrawn + command and thats it.<br>
<br>
FW +24 2(+24)<br>
<br>
Game 2 HB versus sumguys Endor Ops<br>
<br>
He&#146;s doing the mob points thing, and I&#146;m dying to have pile right then. We play cat and mouse for a bit, then I drop on his lone vader with luke w/ stick + scrubs, clear the site except for luke, which I CAN&#146;T lose. not enough damage. He drops, but doesn&#146;t draw high and I do (I had houjix in case) luke covers, and he loses down to iggy. He moves thrawn on Executor plus stuff to confront me, and probes, misses. I remind him its only during deploy phases, but oh, well. I slap down Slayn &amp; Korpril, Ten Numb, Blue 5, adv. proton torps and intruder missile, battle, make avenger immediatly lost, hit chimaera, add 7 to power, and draw a tracked Few Manuevers and a 4 for destiny (lando and nien numb are there. I lose something stupid, and he&#146;s down to Big E + thrawn. We cat and mouse, and I drain/ beat him down.<br>
<br>
FW +19 4(+43)<br>
<br>
game 3 SYC vs. Robert Seville LS tat podracing.<br>
Robert only learned how to play 3 weeks ago. He has become a very skilled player very quickly, but he still has a ways to go. He also beat the snot out of me at magic the previous tuesday, so this was revenge time of sorts :)<br>
However, My deck seems to be having a heart attack, and is very upset for me disturbing it to merely play a game with it, and his deck decides to lay into me with the rapage. However, I didn&#146;t win states because my last name is german, so I win after a long GOOD game of cat and mouse drainage by 10.<br>
<br>
FW +10 6(+53)<br>
<br>
So Its down to me and Caleb, but we both played dark last, so we can&#146;t play.<br>
<br>
Game 4 hb vs. Thompson&#146;s BHBM/Racing/numbers<br>
<br>
Thompson (sorry, dude, I get you and your bro mixed up) is always trying queer a$$ cheese, which is kinda kool, but then, it aint. I pull honor, then reduce the loss by 4 with ICBY, so I lose 3 (NOTE: You cannot use ICBW to cancel all podracer damage, as it refers to one force loss, and wattos box and boonta eve are separate.) He&#146;s sittin there with the Emperor and 2 premier droids at the throne room, and numbers pops, making me lose like 7. I drop Corran Horn and Luke w/ stick on his butt, then follow with quigon with stick after he tries to shoot corran with lightning.<br>
Luke:&quot;Horn here seems to know your mama&quot;<br>
Emperor:&quot;And now you will die...or...um, I guess 1 is my mamas number&quot;<br>
R4-D6:&lt;mournful whistle&gt;<br>
Quigon:&quot;yup, she seems real popular lately&quot;<br>
So I wipe out the emperor, dump luke, and he loses a bunch. Then numbers pops and makes HIM lose 4. I win a game I should against numbers with only corran horn and his little black book for numbers defense.<br>
<br>
FW +17 8(+70)<br>
<br>
Caleb also goes undefeated after beating Robert by 30-ish (I think), but his differential is higher, so he wins his second tourny ever.<br>
<br>
PROPS!<br>
Caleb for winning<br>
caleb for playing my ls and winning <br>
Robert for going 2 and 2 at his first tourny, and giving me a tough game.<br>
all my opponents<br>
Corran Horn for knowing the Emperors Mama (blind date I supose)<br>
anybody who plays starwars to have fun.<br>
Hayes for all the help.<br>
Mark for letting me use his deck<br>
<br>
slops<br>
mark for no numbers defense (naw, just kiddin:)<br>
planet comics for sucking<br>
andersonian SW players for not supporting the TD or playing. You didn&#146;t go to states either. <br>
Some guy named Andy for being a @#$% and posting a !@#$ TR and making SC look like @#$%s.<br>
<br>
And thats it!<br>
The DPC report will be up soon, hopefully.<br>
And Caleb, I&#146;m gonna need my branguses back....:)<br>
<br>
cheers<br>
<br>
