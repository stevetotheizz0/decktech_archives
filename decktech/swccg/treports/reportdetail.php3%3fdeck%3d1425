<br>
Prelude-<br>
<br>
Well, the weekend started out okay.  I had no homework, played a little Soul Caliber (great game), passed on the Bacardi-had to play SW the next day-and hung out at the dorm.  Around 9:30, I decided it would be a good idea to build a light deck.  Now, you must understand my situation.  I&#146;m notoriously bad at coming up with good deck ideas.  However, I am good at making ideas into good decks, sometimes.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I know that the night before a tourney is not the best time to make a deck. But, I had no choice.  I have had a good dark deck that has worked for a while, but my light has been crap.  I had an EBO baragwin deck that I got bored with and I played a friend&#146;s Endor Uprising deck at the MN grand slam.  I also have this awesome idea for a deck, but don&#146;t have the cards for it.  This tourney was going to be used for getting the cards I need and trying to pull out a win or two with my light.  So, with the help of a few friends over AIM-the best invention since sliced bread-I built this pile I like to call a deck.  I went to bed and woke up a few hours later to get on the road for the tourney.  We had 24 show.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Decks-<br>
<br>
Light:  EBO pile.  Aptly named because it&#146;s a bunch of guys and ships w/EBO.  A &quot;night before&quot; deck.<br>
Dark:  The MAD! Abyssin Deck.  Court+Abyssins+Scum=good.  Wins, a lot.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1-My Abyssins vs. Bryan Casey (1460) Profit<br>
<br>
I apologize right now if I screw up any names or ratings.  I did the best I could.  This game was interesting, I have never played a profit deck with the abyssins yet. I started Court, No Bargain, Secret Plans, and Power of the Hutt.  He started Profit, and some effects, but I can&#146;t remember what they were at all.  I drop Jabba and Chall as my aliens and grab a CC engineer.  First turn, I drop the engineer for one and Boelo with POwer, along with Scum.  His turn, he drops Master Luke, threepio, and artoo all at once.  I tell him to deploy them one at a time, and None Shall Pass Luke.  I then drop Ephant and Myo and spread my aliens abyssins around Tatooine.  He comes after Chall and a pair of abyssins with Obi, Chewie and threepio and I play Jabba&#146;s Twerps to play three more for free from RD.  He lost Chewie and Obi from it.  I kept him out of the Audience Chamber the whole game and drained him out for the win.  <br>
<br>
FW (+25)<br>
<br>
2(+25)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Keeping him from freeing Han and keeping him out of the Audience Chamber for the whole game.<br>
Lows:  Nothing at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2-EBO pile vs. Benjamin Steines (1584) Hoth guys, walkers, and stuff<br>
<br>
I started the generators, 4th marker, signal and A New Secret Base.  He starts Ice Plains, combat readiness, and defensive perimeter.  This made me kind of leery.  His first turn, he drops Mara to the Ice Plains and lets me go.  I get some EBO stuff and draw up.  Next turn he drains for one drops Imp Decree and Emperor and says go.  I get EBO, my site, and save up.  He moves to the North Ridge and drops Lord Vader with saber at the Plains.  I get Chewie, Wedge, and an x-wing to the sites, drop EBO and Hoth and say go.  He deploys Zuckuss to Hoth, moves around, says go.  At this point, I&#146;m kind of scared, he&#146;s draining for quite a bit, and I have nothing.  I drop 2 x-wings and Red enleader on zuckuss, play Organized Attack and make him lose Zuckuss and five.  I also get Figrin D&#146;an out.  He drops some Tempest scouts and pilots and moves some guys around.  FOr the next couple of turns I drain for four at Kiffex and Kessel and retrieve one a turn with Figrin.  He&#146;s draining for about 5 at the 3rd, 4th, and 5th markers.  I drop Obi and Gen Solo on the Emperor alone at the fourth marker and make him die.  At this point, I think he&#146;s just about out of Emperors. He&#146;s already lost two from drains and the one from Hoth.  Then, he deploys the dense forest and Danz Borin alone.  I drop EPP Han and battle.  He reacts with TScout 6 and I lose Han, but shoot Danz.  At some point, I get Home One to Hoth for an extra one drain.  Somehow, we get down to the end.  I projection two sites and he drops another Emperor to Endor to back up the TScout.  I deploy Luke to block his drain there.  HE initiates battle against LUke and wins by one, so I lose Luke, retrieve him next turn with Figrin and drain him out.<br>
<br>
FW (+6)<br>
<br>
4(+31)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning a close game.  This was quite possibly the best game I&#146;ve ever played.<br>
Lows:  Not being able to kill him off at Hoth.  Having to Projection my own sites.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3-The Abyssins vs. Michael Raveling (2065) Agents w/eloms.<br>
<br>
I know Michael is good, but I have never had the opportunity to play him.  I start the same as before, he starts Agents, insurrection, uh-oh, and something else.  my starting hand was total crap, so I deployed boelo and an abyssins to the ac.  He comes down with Lando w/ax, Rennek, and Geezum.  He excludes the abyssin and rocks Boelo for about five.  I never went to the Audience Chamber agian.  he got Tessek to the AC and eloms to a couple sites and I couldn&#146;t do anything.  I got my head handed to me.<br>
<br>
FL (-29)<br>
<br>
4(+2)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Absolutely nothing.<br>
Lows:  Getting beat like a red-headed stepchild.  It was ugly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4-EBO pile vs. Ben Pischke (1488) Space w/Kessel start<br>
<br>
I start my EBO stuff, he starts Kessel.  Only Kessel.  He activates four first turn and draws.  I get some sites and draw.  He activates four and saves up.  I get a site, EBO, deploy Figrin and say go.  He saves up.  I drop Obi, Leia, EBO, Kiffex, and move Obi to the Generators.  He drops a Death Squadron Destroyer with three TIEs to Kessel.  I get a couple of x-wings to Kiffex and the Hoth system out.  He moves to hoth and I drop an x-wing in front of him.  he battles and, of course, I run away with Hyper Escape.  I start draining for four at Kessel and Kiffex, each, and that, along with Civil Disorder, eventually did him in.<br>
<br>
FW (+27)<br>
<br>
6(+29)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning and draining for a ton.<br>
Lows:  Nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 5-EBO pile vs. Nathan Harmon (1709) BHBM<br>
<br>
I start my EBO stuff, he drops BHBM, Imp Arrest Order, Mob Points, Insignificant Rebellion, Your Destiny, and something else.  First turn, he pulls Rendili and the DS2: DBay but activated Palpy.  He uses three for a Twi&#146;ek and draws the other one.  I get EBO stuff, drop Goo Nee Tay and say go.  He deploys Palpy and Secret PLans and says go.  I get EBO, and my other site.  He drops EPP Vader to the 4th marker.  I go, deploy Unc. Fury, but can&#146;t find Luke.  I eat the loss and he gets Tarking down.  I get EBO out with Obi, Leia, and Figrin, I think.  Give him Jedi Luke and say go.  At this point we have a question.  He wonders if he can convert with Lord Vader to cancel Unc. Fury.  i argue that Vader is now power 8 with Fury, and can&#146;t be replaced with a power 7 Vader.  Well, he ends up cancelling it that turn with You Are Beaten, and it&#146;s ruled that Lord can replace because of something with cards on Vader or something.  I don&#146;t know.  I would kind of like to know how this has been ruled if anyone knows.  Anyway, he starts moving in to the Echo base and deploys Mara and Fett along with First Strike.  I take over space with x-wings and Incom and start Draining for a lot.  He tries to docking bay out of Hoth, not realizing that he can&#146;t.  he then uses Rise My Friend to get to the DS.  All this time, I&#146;m draining for 7 or so at Kiffex and Hoth and he is doing me minimal damage.  He deploys two Dreadnaughts to stop my drain at Kiffex but I play Organized Attack and end up winning 15-14.  He has no cards on Insignificant Rebellion, and starts dueling Luke to make me lose force.  However, he keeps drawing the Endor: Landing Platform and Mara Jade&#146;s Saber.  His objective, my drains, and Civil Disorder do him in.  I pull off a late All Power to boost my differential and, on the last turn, deploy EPP Han against Tarkin, make him lose one, I retrieve one; and battle against his Dreads with an x-wing to retrieve one and make him lose one, ending the game.<br>
<br>
FW (+21)<br>
<br>
8(+50)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Playing a good game.  Not losing any battles or duels.<br>
Lows:  Forfeiting an x-wing even though they were all immune to attrition.  Having him sense a Signal.  There is nothing that pisses me off more than having someone sense a card like The Signal.  I know it&#146;s a smart thing to do, but it pisses me off.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 6-Abyssins vs. Graham Neal (1873) EBO baragwins<br>
<br>
Now, I&#146;ve played baragwins since I got the idea from Dawi here on Decktech.  I knew what was coming and I set up early on Tatooine.  He ate the court loss.  My second turn, I drained for one at the AC and he lost the Echo Corridor off the top.  I&#146;m really happy at the moment and he&#146;s got this kind of sick look on his face.  His turn, he deploys Han and the Falcon to the Echo DB and grabs Hoth.  He plays On the Edge for one and draws a three retrieving the corridor.  He sighs and I wish he hadn&#146;t had the On the Edge.  Oh well.  I got set up on Tat. and bring Jodo Kast and three abyssins to Hoth.  He gets Han on the Falcon to Kiffex and I drop DiPO from hand and Zuckuss from RD to rattle him, but he had Obi on as forfeit fodder, so nothing happens.  He keeps deploying ships, as do I.  Eventually it&#146;s EPP Luke on Spiral, Han and Wedge, RSL on Falcon agains DiPO, Zuckuss, Bossk and Fett in ships.  We battle he draws a seven and something and I get a three and a frou.  he loses Luke and I have to lose DiPO and Fett (stupid I&#146;ll Take the Leader).  He then drops Luke S. in Artoo in Red 5, battles and whoops me up for my guys plus some.  At this point, I am in position to cancel EBO, however, it would isolate all my guys.  I decide to go after the baragwins and end up killing off two of them.  He On the Edges twice for six both times and I draw my last three when he had one card in hand (I thought it was an On the Edge).  Turns out the card was Punch It.  I would have died next turn anyways.<br>
<br>
FL (-22)<br>
<br>
8(+28)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Playing Graham.  He was really fun to play against, even though he thoroughly trounced me.<br>
Lows:  Losing to a deck I knew how to beat.  I couldn&#146;t infiltrate Hoth fast enough.  Twi&#146;leking for Scum instead of Den of Thieves.  That would have saved me some differential.<br>
<br>
I end up taking fifth.  Graham goes undefeated taking it all.  Josh Coleman, I believe, took second.  I get a Blizzard 2 in my prize support, so I&#146;m happy.<br>
Props-<br>
Pete-for running an awesome tournament.<br>
Graham-for being really cool to play against.<br>
Ben-for giving me that awesome game.  It seriously was the best game I&#146;ve ever had<br>
Michael-for reminding me never to let my guard down, even when my opponent is playing eloms and I have all aliens in my deck<br>
Whoever traded me stuff for my new light deck<br>
Face the Music-for having JPSD, even though no store in my town has any clue about it.<br>
<br>
Slops-<br>
the bagel shop-for being really expensive<br>
the USA-for taxing gas too much<br>
<br>
Thanks all.<br>
