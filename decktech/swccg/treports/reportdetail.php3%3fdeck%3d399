This is more like a look into how f'd up an event in the swccg world can be.  This will offend and piss off most peeps but I dont give a @#$% cause thats how it is in ghetto squad.<br>
<br>
     Chris praskac, ghetto 7, greg hodur, ghetto leader and I TJ Holman, ghetto 2 set out for pa states. Its a three hour trip planned to start at 2 o clock so we leave at 10 with 4 hours to get there. We stop for a half an hour lunch break and then it happens...'what the @#$% is that' i hear from chris. A big tractor trailer lies right in da middle of da turn pike. It rolled its loopy ass over coming off the entrance ramp. We sit still for 45 minutes.  'no @#$%in way were makin it to this tournament' 'chris man just go 90 and how often does a tournament start on time thats run by a decipher person anyway...and even if we are late ill just have to play you' lil did i know that james van fleet was gonna be an @#$% that day.<br>
<br>
      The story continues...we drive 90 miles an hour on an empty tank and pull into the holiday in the tournament was at at about 2:02. I leave my box in the car and jet in. People are shuffling their decks and are paired up I think '@#$%, me and chris gotta play in round 1' I tell floppy penguin looking mutha@#$%a van fleet it took us a long time to get there but we made it and he says 'hey tj i suck fat @#$% and you cant play in round one cause we actually started at 2 o clock and your only 5 minutes late. YOu and chris gotta take round one loss' with no diff'  '@#$% jim, can me and chris play each other' 'well tj i discussed that with everyone, then i took the gerbil outta my ass and we decided you cant play each other cause it would be unfair'  UNFAIR ??? if anything its more fair. Either chris or I gets knocked out right away and we are two of the top players there. Then it happens...i @#$%in explode on everyone. Ghetto squad full represents and @#$% gets outta line. I realize that I have no chance of winning and Im positive Ray will win the tourney. In open protest I begin to play and act like a total @#$%, not my normal way to go but i was pissed and rightfully so.  <br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
I sit and look @#$%in stupid cause I cant play. Chris, greg and I sit and play Ghetto War and yell at everyone.  People come over to say hi to us and showed their sympathy. I ripped up a bb luke in front of a bunch of lil kids just to piss em off and then get ready to give the ass beating of a life.<br>
<br>
Game 2: My dark vs. Random.player speeder ops<br>
<br>
I pull out audience chamber my first turn and jabba. He drops op and speeder. I activate three twi lek then drop battle order, scum and first strike. Game over. At one point 8 sites on bothuwuii had a speeder and an op and before the end of the game I flipped the objective back and yelled out 'pickle @#$%'.<br>
FW +32<br>
<br>
Highs- tech, I drop mara with a saber cause I saw ambush via monnok. Speeder ops is the most overrated light deck out there and is truly weak against any above average player. Dengar with gun is king. Flipping back the objective.<br>
Lows- I should have 4 victory points.<br>
<br>
Game 3: My light vs. Random.player using court<br>
To be honest this was an intresting and fun game. He gets jabba in the chamber early with dr. dre and his gun which i projeciton. I play it could be worse on the court till i put orimakko to the great pit.  he eventually drops sarlaac there and after about 7 turns that penguin lookin @#$% finally eats him, his decks destiny sucked. Meanwhile luke w/ saber sits at the carbontie chamber with a 2 drain and lando in falcon with bo shek at kessel. To fight kessel he drops fett in ship and lat damage. I mover over and cancel and return. Lat damage number 2 rinse and repeat. Then i decided I had enough of that crap and drop a spiral with two pilots and cause an 8 card beating. Dengar and jodo kast with a blaster rifle come to fight epp luke. Dengar gets clashed on his turn but on my turn epp luke is disarmed. Test 2 has been passed and dengar is ready to battle again. his turn he sits there and looks stupid. My turn I drop tawass, chewbacca and epp han to the carbonite chamber and innitiate. I have all 5s stacked and I cause 13 damage plus all the guys. Game over.<br>
FW +28 I think<br>
(4)+60 <br>
<br>
Highs- my deck does everything it was planned to do. he deploys han seeker to the cantina...the only chracter i had in my hand to stop the court was han, i got a laugh outta this.  He hidden weapons a guy that was cool. Disarm surprises me.  Sarlaac has surprisingly low ferocity. he hate daughter after test 2 with a dragonsnake, that was funny as hell too.<br>
Lows- He forgot to drain alot and forgot test 2 alot. Beating him down in several locations.<br>
<br>
Game 4: My dark vs. kim caton using mwyhl bothan spies.<br>
Terrible game for kim. Opening hand I pull jabba, bane and search and destroy. By the 2nd turn i had out bane, jabba, gailid and search causing massive loss. SOS goes off the top to force loss and then at peace so she cant even train a bothan now.  She eventually inserts an anger fear aggression and goes to kessel with mad red squad x wings. The afa pops but i just go to kessel with scum and first strike out...the kessel drain actually helps me since im just controlling it every turn then dropping a ship to retrive 3 and force 1 loss then ghhhk. Quick painless game.<br>
FW +27 I think<br>
(6) +87<br>
<br>
Highs- My oppening hand. Using her drain site to my advantage<br>
lows- Her losing her entire potential to drain giving me a win i didnt have to work for.<br>
<br>
Game 5: My light vs. Joe Youngs Rallops<br>
The most FUCKED game I have ever played in my life.  Game starts slow but my first turn i put tawass to carbon chamber and she lasts for a while. He doesnt find a site once which slows him down but its fair cause he started bad feeling and I drew yoda and have to pay seven for him and 6 for daughter and dont train for a while. He flips around turn 4 and tawass has don major damgage. Then i drop 2 projections and train to test 2, looks like the game is gonna be slow and suck. he drops Vader to carbon chamber, somehow alters the two projections with only 4 chances to in his 30 card deck, battle he draws a 5 i draw a six. He drains me for 3 once (it could be worse cycling the whole time) then i put epp obi to the carbon chamber and He gets out imp decree and sets it up within 2 turns of getting it.  I drop epp luke and the cantina giving me one drain. I find the tydruim and put it and boshek to ralltir to against bossk (no destiny) in to stop decree and give me the win cause i had kessel and kiffex in hand with 2 more ships. Here is why this is the most @#$%ed up game ever and this (besides no round 1 game) cost me much of the tourney. I inntiate against his bossk in ship and tries to react by shuttling up blizz scout 1 for forfeit. I tell him he cant do that...every person in the room tells him he cant do that. It was debated on the list for a lil while about the same situation with zuckuss shuttling to react and the rule was no...shuttling is not a valid react.  Dopey ass van fleet comes over to make the rule. It says plain and clear reacts must use either landing, taking off, hyperspeed, landspeed or deployment; yet he decided joe could do it anyway. I think that decipher should find some way of making it so that tournaments have judges that arent complete @#$%in idiots and who know the rules, especially in a tourney of this level.  So joe gets away with reacting up and is able to keep the ship on the table which @#$%s me hard. Later in the game that ship teamed with zuckuss knocks out my tydruim,boshek and chewbacca which cost me the full win, hes able to keep decree up the rest of the game. Im only able to drain at the cantina and occasionally at his kasshhyyk and my kessel while he has less drains due to sending 2 2/2 to fight epp luke which promptly die (test 2 he forget). I block all drains on ralltir but one and block all space drains so im going to win but time is called. FUCK! Im definitly out of it now. Cause that idiot van fleet took 10 minutes to get the wrong ruling i get screwed again.<br>
TW +6<br>
(7) @#$%ing undeafeted too +93<br>
<br>
Highs: Teching him to death.<br>
Lows: Altering both projections. Him forgetting test 2 alot. And the wrong mutha@#$%in ruling costing me.<br>
<br>
Game 6: My dark vs. random.plyer using obis hut toche station.<br>
<br>
Early on I set up drain for 2 at jundland wastes. He goes to moisture farm with monk and epp leia which ig 88 makes short work of. Then Bane goes there for 2 drain. So i got djas and bane with drains of 2 and jabba in the chamber with 1 drain. He puts masata luke w/saber and proficiency,obi, chewie w/ and tawas at obis hut, i guess cause they look pretty. The game is uneventfull i expected a nabrun beatdown and crap but the whole game i had a ghhk and main course. Nothing happens and i just drain him out in about 20 minutes.<br>
FW +32<br>
(9)+126 and undefeated<br>
<br>
highs- getting main course and ghhhk against what i thought was a deck that might do something. <br>
lows- i was a real prick to this kid cause i was pissed and right fully so but it doesnt matter.<br>
<br>
So after this game Chris is also done so we decide to leave. i end up 5 and 0 with 9 victory points which really pisses me off... people with loss' ended up in front of me.  We try to steal the first place crown and ray ends up breaking it and chrises antena...long story. I think there was a presentation afterwards at which van fleet intentionly lost the bread game     twice.  <br>
<br>
