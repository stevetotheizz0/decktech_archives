<br>
Well finally it happened, the first big tournament this<br>
year, the national. The last couple of months I was tweaking<br>
and toying with decks for this day. I playtested a lot with<br>
my friends Vitor Alves da Silva, Michel Oldenburg and Sander<br>
Dijst. Sander is a former world qualifier and hadn't played<br>
the game for a long time. Now he also dusted off his cards<br>
for this day. It was held in Amstelveen and that's my<br>
hometown and furthermore it was held across the street. A <br>
good 1 minute walk. <br>
<br>
The decks were a problem for me. I always play Mains &amp; Toys<br>
for both sides. For light the choice was between Throne<br>
Room Mains, Tosche Mains or Profit. I played Profit on my<br>
last two tournaments and it hadn't lost there so after some<br>
tweaking and some modifications that was my deck. For dark<br>
there was a big problem. I couldn't find a dark deck that<br>
did well in playtesting. I had tried Endor Ops, <br>
3rd Marker/5th Marker, Court etc. Nothing worked for me.<br>
Then I came across 'The Info Broker's Hunt Down-deck'. It<br>
worked like hell for my opponents in playtesting. So that <br>
was my dark deck. <br>
<br>
Light : Profit modified to my style<br>
Dark : The Info Broker's Hunt Down<br>
<br>
After the big walk we entered the arena. So on to the games.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs Maarten Rossou Court Of The Vile Gangster starting<br>
Bad Feeling Have I<br>
<br>
Maarten is a fun opponent but also a good one. I started <br>
Goo Nee Tay against him. From the moment I took my starting<br>
hand I knew I was in trouble. All I had were interrupts and<br>
effects. So no locations and no characters. He started by<br>
the way with Jabba The Hutt and Chall Bekan. He got <br>
CC-Engineer from his deck and converted the Audience <br>
Chamber. So with no force activation and no characters I <br>
couldn't do nothing but picking up some cards and hoping for<br>
some sites. He setted up some space and in the meantime I <br>
draw some characters, but no locations. So what could I do,<br>
save force and deploy some or drawing more cards up hoping <br>
for some locations. I also couldn't retrieve anymore because<br>
he also setted up a brutal force in the Audience Chamber. I <br>
knew I was losing, but how can I make the loss less <br>
painfull. Well I couldn't I lost with 27.<br>
0 (-27)<br>
<br>
Well that was a good start, NOT!! The good thing about it <br>
was that I lost all the tention about winning the <br>
tournament.<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS vs Jurn de Ruiter Tosche Mains starting Goo Nee Tay<br>
<br>
I talked to Jurn before the tournament about decks by email.<br>
I advised him to use a deck that I send him. He did so I <br>
knew what to expect and started with Presence Of The Force <br>
on Tosche Station. I got an early Vader and deployed him on <br>
my second turn. He also came out strong with an early Luke <br>
on Tosche Station. I was lucky that I got Luke away from the<br>
table and begin a big draining party in space. He tried to <br>
do some damage, but Obi got circled/dueled away and that was<br>
the game there. I won with 22.<br>
2 (-5)<br>
<br>
My dark proved to be a stabile deck.<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
DS vs Bram Snepvangers Speed Profit starting General Han <br>
and Goo Nee Tay<br>
<br>
I didn't know him and with his Magic shirt and his playing <br>
style I could see that he wasn't playing SWCCG on a regular <br>
basis. He made some mistakes now and then, but also <br>
surprised me at one time. I started Come Here You Big Coward<br>
and he obviously didn't know the card. He was struggling <br>
through the game and his Ben got circled early so he had a <br>
hard time pulling his thing off. For me it was an easy game,<br>
I was draining in space as well on the ground. He had no <br>
starships in his deck so space was easy for me. Draining for <br>
8 and Visage killed him. I won with 25.<br>
4 (+20)<br>
<br>
Well if I keep on winning like this I still got a shot at <br>
winning it all.<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
LS vs Paul van Horne This Deal … starting Imperial Arrest <br>
Order<br>
<br>
I had never played aginst him, but there is a first time for <br>
everything. I started normal Profit with Goo Nee Tay. He put <br>
no aliens in the Audience Chamber. He had a hard time <br>
setting up his Deal. I put Tawss Khaa early on Cloud City <br>
and Orrimaarko on another CC location. He is only picking up <br>
cards. In the meantime I was setting up a steady drain at <br>
Bespin with my starships and on Cloud City, because he <br>
wasn't deploying anything. He had maybe 30 cards in hand and <br>
only 15 force in his reserve deck. He setted up his Deal and <br>
could only deploy some characters. They got kicked around and <br>
after I retrieved with profit he stopped the game. I won <br>
with 34.<br>
6 (+54)<br>
<br>
Only two more big wins to go.<br>
<br>
Game 5<br>
LS vs Sander Dijst 3rd Marker/5th Marker Mains and Toys <br>
starting Bad Feeling Have I<br>
<br>
Sander is a good friend and a very good SWCCG-player. I <br>
playtested against him and during playtesting we ended up <br>
50/50 with these decks. I started with Battle Order so when <br>
he started with Mara Jade and moved her away it will cost <br>
him to drain. I had a beautiful starting hand, two locations <br>
and when I drew cards for the first time I picked another <br>
one. So I had enough force to do my thing. We had the first <br>
5/6 rounds every turn a batlle on Tatooine JP. After I <br>
counted my force loss, I thought it was time to retrieve <br>
some force I free up Han. Vader visited the party, but we <br>
both agreed that Orrimaarko is a oneyed son of a b….. He <br>
lost a lot through him. I setted up a drain at the Defensive <br>
Perimeter and it was to much for him to handle. I won the <br>
game with 21.<br>
8 (+75)<br>
<br>
I almost pull it off.<br>
<br>
Game 6<br>
DS vs Johan van der Meer Throne Room Force Choke starting <br>
Goo Nee Tay (I believe, correct me when I'm wrong Johan)<br>
<br>
Johan was the top player at that moment, the only <br>
undefeated player. I must win big here and I was in the <br>
final. He started normal Throne Room. I started with <br>
Presence Of The Force on the Throne Room. He activated and <br>
deployed the Nudj, both of them (not at the Throne Room) and <br>
tried a Revolution on the Med Chamber. Luckily for me I had <br>
one of my 3 Evaders in hand and that was one loss for him. I <br>
had an Vader and his saber in my opening hand and also <br>
Kashyyyk. Deployed Kashyyyk picked up and saved some force <br>
for my next turn Vader. He wasn't really in the game and <br>
made some big mistakes. I had my Vader down and drained him <br>
for 4 at the Throne Room and two at Kashyyyk (I had Zuckuss <br>
there in the meantime). It was to much for him to handle. <br>
The Visage did his work although he cancelled it at one <br>
point. The crucial mistake he made was that he activated <br>
until he had two force left. He looked for a Nudj only to <br>
look at the two cards. I got to verify that it was a 0 and <br>
a 4. He used Nabrun to get Obi against Vader and he draw the <br>
4. I had on the other hand a Circle in my hand and used it <br>
against him. He had only one force left and that was the 0. <br>
Game and I won with 26.<br>
<br>
The impossible happened I'm the top player after 6 games, so <br>
that means I will play the final against no. 2. That was <br>
Maarten Rossou, but we both wanted also to attend the Young <br>
Jedi tournament and since we both are going to Brussel we <br>
agreed not to play the final. So we are both the Dutch <br>
Champions for a year, only I got the props because I was the <br>
top player.<br>
<br>
By the way Young Jedi sucks ass. There was no fun at all, <br>
only when we played each other and when I played Jeroen van<br>
de Bosch (he's also a swccg-player). (for the record I went <br>
3-3)<br>
