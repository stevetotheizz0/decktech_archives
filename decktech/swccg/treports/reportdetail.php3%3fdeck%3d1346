Another world&#146;s tourny post.  the format of this is the same as all the other TRs, alot of pre tourny garbage, then onto the games, then a bunch of slops/props. And during the whole TR I&#146;ll try to be witty but of course, like those who have come before me, I&#146;ll fail.<br>
Ok PRE TOURNY GARBAGE><><><><><><><><<br>
    Sometime in mid September I was thinking to myself, I really wish I had won my regional(kashyyyk) because it would be really cool to go to DCOn.  hayes Hunter, Steve Baroni, Mike gemme and alot(and I mean alot!) of other kashikians(for some reason Microsoft word didn&#146;t like this word...I wonder why?)( D&#146;hoh! that was my first failed atempt at being witty!)<br>
So alot of people were going to be going and It looked like it was going to be a kickass time.  But alas i didn&#146;t win my regional so theres no way I could go.  Maybe next year. But wait!  why I couldn&#146;t i go there and Just pay my own way down there.  While College was eating away at most of my money, I still had about $300 in the bank from working in the summer and was expecting another $200 in the mail from reffing AAU basketball.  I talked to hayes and he said he could hook me up with a room and that I should go because It waould be a kick @#$% time!  So I was like f.uck. I really want to go now.  I have the money and a place to stay So what the hell I&#146;m gonna go.  After @#$%ing at my teachers to get some tests moved around I&#146;m on my way.  DCON here i come.<br>
<br>
WEDNESDAY><><><<br>
Three midterms today!! Gah!! I finish up early, I reaking failed em all but who cares I&#146;m going to DCON!!  I leave Logan Airport at 5:20 and am on my way. the plane almost crashes and there are poepl literally screaming in fear as we leave boston because for some reason we hit and air pocket or something and the turbulance is insane.  Ok, I get to Orlando airport at like 9 and it&#146;s the freaking best airport ever.  The only way to explain it is it&#146;s like the Jetson&#146;s house, with glass elavators and @#$%.  it was cool.  i wait around for the Deciphere shuttle and see some fellow gamers whop I&#146;ve never met before. One of them is the Chandrilla champion(Italy) and some other Germans, we chat a littel while and they all start talking in another language and i&#146;m like f.uck, this is america , talk my language.  But they were cool guys.<br>
I get to double tree at like 10 and meet up with my roomates, Hayes and Mike Gemme.  I drop my @#$% off and pull out my decks to playtest in the lobby.  For all of you who weren&#146;t there, The Double tree Hotel was pretty cool, It had very nice common areas and gave out free cookies.  Wednesday night evrybody was all happy and playtesting in the lobby so it was cool.<br>
I sit down in th lobby and play a game with David from Italy(chandrilla champ.  I test out my light deck and he throws it around.(my light was Mwyhl with visored visons(bah that deck sucks).  So i see who else is there, TJ holman, he&#146;s a loud kid with a small head.  But he&#146;s cool.  Mike Girard and a bunch of ghetto squad is also there.  As well as Kyle Craft who&#146;s pretty cool dude.<br>
Hayes is big and bad obout his light deck which is EBO but staret heading for the med frigate and play 5x ANSB. It&#146;s pretty decent but both me, Kyle and everybody else say it will get raped by any deck that runs CHYBC.  So by now it&#146;s like 1 in the morning and I don&#146;t have a light deck.  We all go back to our room(Kyle to as he&#146;s jumping in with us, cool)  I play my dark against Kyle and he throws it around. So i decide to play Kyle&#146;s deck for light and stick with what I have for dark(high destiny BHBM).  So i build a TRM deck but i don&#146;t feel comfortable with it.  Well I&#146;m too tired to change it so I go to bed.  For all you ladies out there interested in what we were waering to bed, hayes had on plaid boxers, Kyle the same(no...they weren&#146;t wearing the same pair...ewwww. they were just the same TYPE). Mike and Me both went to bed clothed and Alex tennet who was alos in our room, was wearing black boxers....OK...Well he&#146;s from England so what can I say.<br>
So we go to bed, but here&#146;s the highlight of my TR, Alex and Mike are in one bed, Kyle and Hayes in another, and me on the floor.  When Hayes and Kyle are in bed, Hyaes has his heets covering up to his waist, kyle has his sheets covering his nipples, So, It looks like a TV show were a man and woman have just had sex and the man(hayes) has the sheets up to hi waist and the Woman(sorry Kyle covering her up to her neck).  It was funny.<br>
<br>
Thurday><><><><><><<br>
I wake up at 6, change my light back to MWYHL but drop the visored visons and make it more centered on space.  This turned out to be a good decison.<br>
Ok so we get up, wait in line now you all know the lines werew long and the games were delayed even longer.  Decipher did their best but they should&#146;ve siad ok, we&#146;re delayed, go take off for an hour while we fix it instead of saying, &quot;the games could start any minute so don&#146;t go anywhere to eat&quot;)<br>
So we wait, we hang with the twiggs and other and just basically hang around do nothing.<br>
One thing I do see, A huge amount of good players who haven&#146;t qualified for day 2.  So I&#146;m thinking theres no way I make it to day 2.<br>
<br>
Onto THE GAMES><><><><><><<br>
Game 1, My Light MWYHL vs. ??????? ????&#146;s BHBM (he was from canada.)<br>
I forget his name but he said he was from Montreal, and he hung around with Yannick all weekend.<br>
He starts BHBM with IAO, Mpoints and oppresive, I start my usual(wise advice,battle plan,and squassins)<br>
First turn hhe drops Rendilli(why do people play with this?  Carida is sooooo much better?) Emp&#146;s power and emperor to the carida DB(why did he deploy emp&#146;s power then?)<br>
I pull out yoda, and insert AFA, he gets out some imps and such, I complete my test and draw up my super falcon and wait for him to deploy to space(right now he&#146;s paying 3 to drain for 1 which just makes his AFA&#146;s come up faster< BTW vader has not seen action yet).<br>
eventually he drops fett in boat and a dreadnaut to rendilli, next turn i drop super falcon, he barriers, so i grab it, then i drop OTE.  I say go, he deploys another ship, AFA comes up, he battles, i draw good destiny, he draws crap, I lose nothing, he loses everything.  But alas i have no L starfighter in my hand.<br>
So the game slowly continues, I pay to drain for 1, he pays to drain for 1.  Eventaully he comes back with a bucnch of ships and kills my guys, I am like s.hit! because now he has a system and a site.  Next turn I do nothing but draw, I get a god draw, CHS, falcon, Epp Leia, L Starfigher and wede and wedge&#146;s ship, I save up, some. Next turn he drians me for a few, I eat the drains and the turn afetr that I come back and beat him off of space for something like 15 force and L starfighter.  Luke and Obi come out late game and satisfy battle plan, as does kessel. He draws up before I can play my retrieval.<br>
<br>
FW(+16)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning.  realizing I picked the right deck. He was cool.<br>
Lows: Him sensing my On the Edges.<br>
<br>
Hayes Won, Mike won (by 28!!), Pretty Much all the big names won.  Steve baroni lost.<br>
<br>
Game 2, My dark BHBM vs. Matt Socal&#146;s HB mains.<br>
So I&#146;m like f.uck, I have to play a Really high ranked player and he&#146;s gonna cream me!!<br>
But what the heck let&#146;s play the game and see what happens.  I get the emp out early, drop some guys with him. He gets out madine and strts pulling out &quot;guys&quot;.<br>
Mara comes out and wins a battle, Iggy does the same.  DVDLOTS come sout and chokes DOS(high destiny baby)  So I&#146;v won like 3 battles and I&#146;m like damn I can win this!!<br>
He gives me luke, I go to duel, We have some battles, he win a bunch of them.  I&#146;m losing 1 to my objective and like 2 to his drain of 2 at the home one DB (he has sabers there.) He&#146;s losing one to my drain at carida and 3 to my duels, but he ICBWs it evry turn!!<br>
The game is close.  But eventually I move mara and Iggy infront of his guys, he battles, I capture han and only have to lose my guys and no additional force.  Next turn i duel and he doesn&#146;t have any force for ICBW, I win! FW(3)<br>
<br>
4(+19)<br>
Highs: Beating the eventual world champ.  Beating A high ranked player.  My dark beating mains.  He was super cool.<br>
<br>
Lows: nothing.<br>
<br>
Hayes won again, Mike and Steve Lost.<br>
<br>
Game 3, My Light Vs. Tim Guzman&#146;s BHBM mains.<br>
He had beaten Steve in both of their forst 2 games.  So I figured he knew what he was doing.<br>
I start my usaul he starts the BHBM usual.  He gets out The emp and guys, His deck is almost the same as the first guys deck.  Altho he plays more space.  He drps lord Vader, I give him Luke, Obi makes a few hit and runs.  Super falcon kills like 5 dreadnauts and all the BH ships.  HEHE superfalcon is awesome. kessel and L starfighter come up, he loses 6 per turn, I lose nothing.  But damn he senses my On the edges too!! FW+11.<br>
<br>
Highs: winning.  Beating A high ranked player.  <br>
Lows: playing a game almost the same as my first game.<br>
<br>
Game 4, My dark vs. hayes TRM.<br>
Great....He&#146;s playing the same deck that Kyle tossed me around with last night....and he&#146;s my roomate....great.<br>
He gets out activation and nudjis, I get the emp and janus.  By like turn 3 he drops luke, obi and like 4 other guys, battles playes some interupts, I play I have you now to draw three destinies, I draw a 1, 1, and 0(and i have 20 destines in the deck that are 5 or higher).  I lose the battle by like 22.  I get off a feew drains here and there but he battles me out.  Vader gets OOC&#146;ed too.<br>
FL -29.<br>
<br>
Highs: At least hayes gets the win.  <br>
Lows:  Hayes taking the shoe that was stuffed up his @#$% at Gen Con and subsecquently shoving it up my ass.<br>
If I had to do it over, I probably would&#146;ve played the game just to lose by a less as opposed to trying to win it.  It bacfired and my Diff suffered horribly)<br>
So now I&#146;m like 6(+1) hehe, thats crazy diff.<br>
<br>
Game 5, My light vs. Some guys huntdown.  <br>
My apologies, i forgot your name.  He started usual huntdown /BHBM stuff.  I started The Honor getter instead of wise advice.<br>
I got hono in my opening hand.  His Huntdown was heavy dueling so I said to my self, I&#146;ll just never deploy obi or luke.  I train Luke, And let the super falcon do it&#146;s work in space.  L Startfighter is a beast.<br>
He eventually satisfies Honor, but it&#146;s too late. But...he senses my On the edges!!  Fw+16.<br>
<br>
Highs: winning.  It was a fun game.  My light is a beast!!<br>
Lows:  nothing.<br>
<br>
Game 6, my dark vs. TIGIH guys and high destiny.<br>
Sorry I forgot your name.  This was the guy who screamed during game 8 and got out of his chair.  But he was cool.<br>
I drop out my dudes, he gets out madine and some scouts.  Mara comes out, YAB&#146;s amdine and beats up the guy who was with him.  Vader atkes luke.<br>
I duel...and lose...so I&#146;m like, ok, I won&#146;t duel anymore.  He drops guys, he drains, i counter assault him for 15 damage.  that was pretty much game.  I got a drain in space.  A spy and leia come out late to try to kill Vader but leia gets chocked and thats game.<br>
FW+20.<br>
<br>
Highs: winning. he was cool.  It was a good matchup for my dark.<br>
Lows...Nothinh mutch, I almost lost this one f I ahd kept dueling, he woulda converted vader:)<br>
<br>
So right now I&#146;m 5-1 +38. And felling pretty good.   But that would change soon.<br>
<br>
Game 7, My light vs. Karl Sunburg&#146;s Endor opps.<br>
Karl is from Kashyyyk. Great.....  He gets out some guys to endor, then some ships to endor, i draw for my superfalcon but keep getting used monnoked. <br>
By the time i can deploy my ships, he has like 30 power at each sysytem.  U fury almost wins this one for me. But it&#146;s just not a good matchup.  But he played great. FL-5.<br>
<br>
Highs: none.<br>
Lows.  Losing.  If I had played it right and gotten a little more lucky i coulda won.  But props to him, he played great.<br>
<br>
Game 8, My dark Vs. Christian ????&#146;s asteroid sancuary.<br>
This game was horrible. i fell assleep during the game, forgot what my cards did, and playede like a fool.<br>
I drop guys down, he gets out sancuaries to two systems, with chs and gen lando at one system and wege at another.  I have ZiMH and Boba w/blaster in my hand, i drop them to where hab and lando are. I battle, I forget what my cards do and let him draw destiny, he draws good destiny and both of us lose every thing.  Since i satisy first Sanc isn&#146;t cancelled.  and to top it all off i forget to tell him to stack a card.<br>
I continue to duel him and make him lose 3 force(he gave vader farmboy.) I battle wedeg with bossk and kill him, I forget to tell him to stack again. D&#146;oh!! sancuary for 6 a turn is too much.  I &quot;lose&quot; by 12.<br>
<br>
Highs:  none.<br>
Lows.  The worst game I ever played.<br>
<br>
Just so you know, if i had told him to stace those 2 cards for the battle i woulda easily converted luke and won the game(i run really high destinies and traffic control.)  also, If i had just let the asteroids kill off his ships I coulda just dropped my ships and cancelled sanc.<br>
Also, I f I had cancelled his destiny with ZiMh I woulda canclled that sanc and that woulda been enought for me to win the game.<br>
<br>
So I finish 5-3 but I ahve lousy diff and don&#146;t qualfy.  Maybe next year.<br>
<br>
hayes qualifies. As does Kyle. so do a bunch of other people.  A bunch of poepl get dis qualified.  The players are outraged.  Some of us go talk to Juz about it, he says theres nothing i can do, I say, &quot;the hell theres nothing you can do, you run the whole f.ucking thing, change this f.ucking mess&quot; he says something is austarilian and walks away.<br>
So I&#146;m pretty down, that I miseed the cut.  i finish like 41st.  Matt Socal says a few things to cheer me up.  That dude is masaaaaaadddd cool.<br>
<br>
So I go back to the lounge, i play a few games, Beat the s.hit outta Chris Twigg with my foil visage deck(lol!) he&#146;s a cool dude tho and we alugh about me falling asleep during game 8.<br>
Hayes meets this skanky asian girl and for some reason everyone there starts hitting on her.  Beats me why they were hitting on her and not the Aurra Sing lady because she was like 40000 times hotter.  But whatever. Apparently hayes hooked up wuth her but i don&#146;t believe it.  They probably just played twister all night or something(I know you&#146;re reading this Hayes:)).<br>
So I go to sleep and get some much needed rest.  <br>
Friday Rolls around and I play in some various events.  It was pretty fun.  that night I go explore Kissimee Fl.  This town sux ass. Everything there is either hotel, travel agency, or a store that sells nothing but towels and bootlegged t-shirts.<br>
Kyle qualifies for day three, so does Steve Brentson (using my crossfire!) hayes gets @#$%.ed out of day three by feldman.  Everyone knows feldman sucxass.<br>
<br>
Saturday Rolls around And I do some sightseeing during the day.  Come back to learn Matt won it and i chukle because it&#146;s cool to say I beat the world champ, at world&#146;s no less.<br>
That night I Play a japanese sealed deck and have a blast playing.  I pull a japanese vader for prize support! yayyy for me!!  I grab some @#$% from the hotel restaurant(otherwise known as pizza).  And chill out.  Then around 4 am me, brian c ,TJ, hayes, Meike Girard, Hayes&#146; girl, steve baroni, joe alread, and about 10 other dudes(we&#146;re all drunk by the way) decide to make the 1/2 mile treck to Denny&#146;s.  So we go there. Along the way we piss on a car, TJ bangs on hotel windows and wakes everybody up(including some jacked guy who was ready for blood).  We chill at denny&#146;s. hayes pull&#146;s a d.ick move and talks to some old hobo at The counter in Denny&#146;s but It&#146;s all good because we have a blast.  TJ Holman thinks I&#146;m funny, and I think starts hitting on me(?)  what&#146;s that about TJ? JK. I eat some peper and make TJ laugh.  I dance in my seat and make everybody laugh.<br>
An hour after that I go to the Airport and go back to boston where it&#146;s 50 degrees and about to snow.  Peace out from Florida.  Now it&#146;s time for Props and Slops.<br>
<br>
