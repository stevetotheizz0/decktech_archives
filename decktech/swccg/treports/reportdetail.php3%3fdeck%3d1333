LIFE OF THE PARTY ! LIFE OF THE PARTY ! LIFE OF THE PARTY ! LIFE OF THE PARTY ! LIFE OF THE PARTY ! LIFE OF THE PARTY !’’................My song from the Planet Smashers.<br>
<br>
Ok, this is my tournement report on Florida party. but I will try to do my best to remember my games.... but I forgot most. So, it all started when I was at the airport.... we have lots of time to waste, so me martin, and raphael decide to play some game. Its a good idea since I did not play any single game in the last 2 week. I love to much my girlfriend, I always wunna be with her. So I play another game with my BHBM, and it put my record to 26-0. Then we past the guy at the frontier to the USA. And because I am dress like a wunna be punk, the guy ask us like 100 question. finaly we pass. In the plane, me and raphael and yannick&#146;s girlfriend we play a game call Beigne. I still dont know how to play that @#$%ty game, I am so stupid, but I was trowing random cards, and winning. <br>
<br>
Then we stop at another airport, and we have 3 hours to waste. I tell Raphael I am the best player of the world at any fighting game, and he said he was gunna beat my a$s. so we go to the arcade, and I go to the killer instinct game... and he go to the pac-man game. He said... oh, I thaught you thaught you were good at pac-man, I dont know how to play at killer instinct. lol. So we go to the burger king. And there was free drink refill, so we drink all kind of sh!t with 1 glass for 3 hours. We even taste unsweated ice tea.... It taste like mexicain piss ! Raphael told me I was a good player, but my weakness was that I believe everything people tell me in game, then he said, maybe you do that to have a newbie look, but if you really do that, be caucious. I didnt really listen to his advice… I should have tho . (read game 4 of day 3 )Then we play more games, I was playing EBO baraguin against Jo Machine BHBM deck. And he was wrecking my tomato a$s. I was force to go fight him with captain han, and 2 baraguin.... then I super tech him with captain had ability, and he was starting to loose. But The Machine is DA machine, and Jo is Tha Machine, so he eventualy beat my as$. Then some scrub came near us. and tell us, are you going to D-Con. We said no, we are gunna kick some a$$ at D-Con. And he make his scrub face, and went away. So we catch our plane. In the plane, I was speed up. I was yelling like a crazy. So a Lady said sumthing... then she said SHUT UP ! so I said... well you b!tch, you better shut your f!cking mout before I kick your a$$. Anyways, I start to b!tch at her And my friend made me stop. Then I start to talk at the scrub that was going to D-Con, he was funny. He had 1600 rating I think. Then I try to make Julie and Jo kiss togeter, I never saw them kiss.... anyways, I wrote it on a big piece of paper, and put in in the air... so they kiss ! wohoo ! So the plane land,And I yell like a little girl because I think it will crash . At the airport, we take our lugage, and meet a fur guy. He was the friend of Charles hickey, and had fur everywhere on his body. <br>
<br>
So we go to the hotel in a small truck. the driver put some hawaian music... it was so gay... but I was in the mood, so I start dancing like a crazy fu!ker. At the hotel, I go see yannick, and he introduce me to martin akesson, and koen meijssen 2 of the coolest guy there. I play a game against martin. he was wrecking me, but I did some baraguib tunel vision with a x-wing laser canon on ZIMH, and win that game by like 1. just because I am lucky. From what I saw, martin is a hell of a player. Then, me and Julie we go buy some eggs to comb my hair, and a bread to eat our nutella. Then we go sleep.<br>
<br>
On the morning we get in line to have our D-Con pass. Then I meet Neal, and John, to really cool dude.But that @#$% was so f*cking long, it took like 4 hours to start that tournement. It just suck balls. Then, I start to be a litle stressed... so every 10 minutes, I go to the bathroom to piss. So the tourney start, and I really hope me, jo, raphael, and martin make top 38.<br>
<br>
For light side, I play the only deck that was hapening to be in my deck box, a EBO deck eith baraguin and off the edge with super duper falcon. For dark I play BHBM , tha MACHINE !<br>

I deploy my other docking bay. jabba, search and destroy. and split my character. he had batle plan in play. and I was ocuping rendili. So I was out draining him.he deploy general solo and nien num and try to beatdown. but I play you are beaten on leia. and hummm. on his turn he then move leia… on my turn, I realise she was you are beaten… and I told him that… he said your right and made a smile &#61514; I start to laugh ! your tha man gary ! I won a big SAC war… my game<br>

<br>
Game 2. my deck VS Brian Ripito… Ice plain/peremeter deck<br>
<br>
that matchup suck for me… he deploy ozel on defensive peremeter first turn. I put yoda. he deploy vader and vader lightsaber, and presence of the force !!!! I deploy ben kenobie and his lightsaber on tatoine. He deploy blizard 2 and another pilot… I cant go in that site… so I deploy Jedi Luke and his saber at the other docking bay Later he deploy forect cleaning presence of the force, tempest 1, igar, janus, emperor…. so he drain for 7 all games, and I drain for 4… I play some on the enge and off teh edge… he grab and sense. at the end, my only chance is my ITCBW… but he play its worst of 8…<br>
<br>
FL 8<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, I go watch the YJ final as my Friend play that final with spikes like me on his head &#61514; he won the first game… but got a unlucky draw in the second game… so he lost &#61516; well congrat Philippe parise, making the final of YJ mean your f*cking lucky… so with practice at SWCCG, and all your luck, you can become good :) I am just kiding, good job man.<br>
<br>
Game 3 my @#$% raper LS deck VS Kyle craft last game for the eternity ROPS deck.<br>
<br>
First turn, he deploy a atst pilot to raltir docking bay. My turn, I deploy Orrimarko. batle he play projective thelepathy. then I show to the cameraman Orrimarko, and tell him that Orimarko is his dady ! He deploy janus and someone and try to rape orrimarko. but I draw a 5 , and he draw a 1… thats bad I did not had falen portal… he lost 2 force. I deploy yoda, I attack with the now imune to 5 orrimarko… he lost 2 more force. he put vader, I barier. Now comes Jedi luke and saber. he lost all + 6 force. he have a huge lost pile, and it was only the 3rd turn. Well, I was In control of this game with Ben Kenobie and Order to Engage.<br>
<br>
FW + 25<br>
<br>
Ok, I have the best diferential of the 2-1 guys…. I win this 1, I go to the final…. but I play my mentor, yannick.<br>
<br>
DOM’S MACHINE VS YANNICK MACHINE KILLA DECK !<br>
<br>
first turn, I deploy emperor and janus to the docking… he knows my play style, so If I have 1 force left… it mean I have a barrier… but I did not had a barrier &#61514; anyways, he deploy Jedi Luke and stick and move to the emperor site. I have no vader in hand. I activate … search for 1 of my 2 docking bay… they are in my force pile… thats game, I am dead… wait… maybe I can janus for a vader. He cut my deck. and hit it with yoda (fung)pupet… I cut back my deck and hit it with max rebo…. max rebo won… I janus… CHOKE VADER ! Well, The game was close till I atack with like 20 people epp leia and captain han… he play falen portal on vader. he said, since you upgraded your vader to a lord and your insightserve you well is on table, I need a 5 to crush him… I said yeah. ( in fact he needed a 6 ) well , I batle , and he falen portal and drew a out of comision japanese… damn… vader is lost, and jedi luke come back to the dark side… that was game… anyways, it was my fault, and I know yannick just made a mistake, he is to honest. he super falcon me, and he won. I feel really hapy about going 2-2 , so I dont mind ! I was just so happy for him !<br>
<br>
I watch the final…. Yannick play good in the first game, and won… then in the second… when I saw den of thieves hit the table. I knew yannick would not make him loose anymore force… So I just left the room… I came back later, and yannick was almost dead… that Sandwirl deck was gay ! but f*cking strong ! congrat to whomever who build it. And also to matt for chosing it, and playing it like a champ ! MATT ROCK !<br>
<br>
So I finish 5, and I am hapy with it… well 6 would have been beter.. so next year I could have finish 9… witch make 6 and 9. well 69 !<br>
<br>
So there is this buffet at seaworld… When entering the room, I made a slow dance with raphael…lol… hey ! I was just happy ! then when eating… everybody who saw me can say I am the dumbest player of the world. I was eating without fork or knife or anything… just my mouth, not even my hands ! I was spiting stuff everywhere. I stole a fake tomato ! I was shaking 7up batle before opening it…. anyways…. it was fun ! So I get my trophy, and I proudly show my t-shirt with F*CK YOU I HAVE ENOUG HFRIEND written on it. Now, I wanted to go ask shannon baska for a dance. yannick told me if I did, he pay me the beer… but then I think… f*ck you ! beer if free ! It would have been funny tho. She look so shy ! I went to take a picture with her,  and she said sumthing… then I said sumthing like dont worry, your pretty. and her face turn red.<br>
<br>
Then In the bus to go back to the hotel, I feel bad. Philippe parise, the finalist from YJ start talking about how many woman he f*ck back in ontario, and Yannick was talking about the size of his P*nis ! Then Raphael was telling me, hey Dom you wish you were as good as philippe hey ! I tell him , no f*cking way man, I have my girlfriend, and its forever !Witch reminds me, The game call p*nis is the coolest game ever ! thanx clint !<br>
<br>
So we go back to the hotel.  We are like 10 guys who decide to go in the woman bathroom… I dont know for the rest of the guys, but I piss everywhere !hehe.  Then we got to play this sealed deck… I decide to play with only japanese card and 3 bubo, so my deck suck big times ! its a 40 card sealed deck… I lost by 32. I almost did nothing ! then I come back to play… and they tell me I suck too much , and they made me drop ! lol !<br>
<br>
So we go sleep, and decide team Quebec will not play in the team event, we need to relax on the pool, and go shoping. I also play a ping pong game with some scrub… da*n, he beat my a$$ 21-2 ! I thaught I was good !<br>
<br>
So the day is over, and I go tell bye to my friends. I must go sleep at the airport, because I have no more room to sleep in… so I went to the airport at 11 pm, and my plane was at 6 :30 am !!!<br>
<br>
well, we almost did not sleep. I didnt wanted to get rape. So I unpact my lugage like 2 times to waste times. I made a mad profit deck… God that new lando is your dady !
