I did not attend this tourney.<br>
My friend Rebekah&#146;s friend Jim passed away a couple of weeks ago (age 18. Killed by a drunk driver). She said he taught here to play magic that day and took him home and got high. She said she murdered his AOBS with the MWYHL Xwing beatz ...Killed him then a drunk killed him. I felt so sorry for her. Just about the same thing happened to me but he wasnt quite my best friend (I love ya Rob) She emailed me this MONSTROUS email and she talked about her tourney. I can only cut and paste so much of it because wierd mood swings, some tons of detail, some hardly any detail, and some with &quot;I activated 14, used 2 to deploy....&quot;, she uses &quot;I&quot; and I didnt attend this and it would be to many tags to edit out and it would be the worlds absolute longest TR in history. I read peoples who say longest ever but this one would dwarf all of them combined. <br>
<br>
Rebekah, who I met on a chat board back in 98. I started playing soon after because of Michael Crosby, # 13 in Yavin IV, 6 in TN and told her about it and we started talking tech and shat and played over AIM and cardtable. Shes pretty good. Ive shown her all my decklists ive made (not necessarily posted) and then her friend Jeremy (Jim) Scott passed away.  She has went to college and dosent have much time to mess around on the net and is not a member of Decktech. She is a very smart girl and wont let anything distract her from school. This did though and she sent me an email and I put together this tr from it. you dont have to give me ratings. This is helping her honor her friend. I&#146;ll add the props ans Slops cause she didnt. `Nuff said<br>
<br>
Game 1 Her boyfriend Jeff ? (MKOS Skrillings)<br>
I played Jeffy. I ussed my variation of EBOX (like bekka, ryan, that hunter dude u mentioned combined tech EBOX) I figured I could hndle it be cause Ive been playing that Mind What You Have Learned/ Save You It Can X wing swarm I told ya about. I wanted to play for fun to honor him... FU_KING GODDAMNIT TO HELL THAT FU_KING BASTARD SOB A$$HOLE  .................(edited) <br>
He Played the Skrillz and we started the usual shat. He pulled the Audience Chamber and used it to deploy Jabba, Yes you heard me Special Edition Jabba, mofo :) and drops S&amp;V. It dont make a FU_K! Jim&#146;s with me damnit. I dont care if he does usually own me im winning this beyotch. I grab the Warroom and Echo Base Garrison Is that what you said to do? B4 I activated my 6. I dorp them and use ebg to get wedge and droped the docking bay and hoth i drew in starting handI orginized attack lost tossing a rebvel fleet becuse I fifured it wouldnt help me in this game... little did I know. I paid 4 for the signal and grabed Incom and slapped it down on the warroom and I dropped an x to the db and say go hun. He deploys Ephant Mon via Power of the Hutt to the Audience chamber. and says go babe. okay hun (Okay enough with this lovey crap im not typing anymore of it so dont be pissed cause there would be tons) I grab the Corridor and EBO and drop  xwing there and fly the one at the db cause its free dat way just for a quick drain the I dont think he will cancel. I say go.. Jeffy dropped Lower Passages and deployed bib there for free and gailid to the Audience Chamber. damn i should have deployed wedge and hobbie and set up EBO. He says go. I grab corulag. activate, drain 1 (HOLY SH!T DEN OF FUC_ING THIEVES!! take that beyotch!!) dorp hobbie wedge, zev&#146;s speeder to the db  an xwind and set up the operations. deploy corulag and my 2nd rebel fleet and move 2 X&#146;s to corulag and moved hobbie and wedge over to the corridor and Db respectively.. drain of 6 nest turn uncancelable except with your 2 potes not likely yet babe. He drains for 3 cancel, and 2.  Deploys mosep, Jabba&#146;s Space Cruiser with Dr. Evezan &amp; Ponda Boba combo piloting ,which I barrier, and Dengar In Punishing One But he dosent battle . I drain for 6 Slapdown Order 2 engage and bacta tank. I drop Epp Obi in the chamber, an xwing laser cannon. I power pivot (tossing my signal) the Space Cruiser, and shoot down Dengar in p1 that crashes un a huge fireball on the unsuspecting surface of Corulag. Obi throws down in the AC. I swing at gailid to use up my 1 and 2 and draw my tracked Jedi Luke. he draws EPP fett so its my 11 to 9 I&#146;m immune and he sure as hell isn&#146;t. so he loses Gailid and Ephant Mon. I chill with fat A$$ and the nimbet. he better do something. he drains for 2 off the top but its a system and my 2 xwings . Im fine. He loses 3 from O2E and moves his forces over. in front of obi. Drain 6 boushh comes, breaks cover, gets anikins stick and I battle I can hit everybody but I dont want to hit Elephant man cause that would cover my about to be massive battle damage. Obi hits Bib with a 5 and a 2, and Boussh hits jabba with a 4 and a 2. and I draw a 5 destiny to his 4 Finally a Skrilling makes a showing  Im immunt, he aint so power 15 to 8. Game. I win by 21<br>
<br>
High: beating mu beau.<br>
Low: Jim will never play again.<br>
<br>
 okay heres where I start to ad lib<br>
<br>
(good tracking Smart swings)<br>
she never got ro retrieve or it would have been (2 +30)<br>
I saw no mistakes she made)<br>
<br>
Game 2 (My dark deal- shamless plug: The Rx Wrex Dex- Dark Deal vs Nick Randals TRM  (this guy had bad luck and my deck worked flawlessly so its ugly<br>
<br>
She didnt say what he started with so I a$$ume the norm. He draws and says &quot;Hell Yeah! God hand!&quot; Damnit! 2nd turn Massa Luke, GOTM uhoh! Ani&#146;s saber -2nd turn Drain 3 blows. She grabs the Executor AFTER she activates, 1 mistake. but its still there so not to bad. She drops Cloud city Db and PWest gallery Imp commands Piett and grabs Merrejk and pulls ex:DB and deploys Piett for 2, MM for Ghhhk draws and says go. He drains for 3 , Owen and Beru to lukes site and lando with axe to west gallery ans says go. She deploys DLOTS with saber to lukes site and Merrejk to the CC:DB who pulls/deploys Fondor and transits him to EX:DB (She has a trick up her sleeve (ghhhk and lord vader plus you&#146;ll see)<br>
and says go. He drains for 2 and initates at vaders site. (he forgot it says if lost during opponests turn luke is poewr +6) he misses Vader and Vader hits owen/beru hes says powe 11 luke , she said read your damn card and giggles. he sais I&#146;ll be damned! she blind draws a Palpy and he a EPP Obi do its 6 to 11. and luke and this anut/uncle go bye bye and vader retakes his drain. Lando moves to block the drain of merrejk cause he dosesnt want the crew at the EXDB to trsnsit over or to have to face vader hes screwed either way. but hopees by drawing he can salvage something. on her then the activates 4 monnok lost and gets two ote and 2 EPP&#146;s (leia or han i think) and finishes activating. Vader Drains for 2 and she drops Executor to fondor drops her AO and bespin. She moves the crew at the DB to the bridge and CCDB and moves to Bespin where Merrekj transits up. leaving Lando alone to drain for 1 big whop. She ends her turn. He starts to activate and she pulls Monnok/Evader (SCREW REVO MOFO) but doesnt play it because he hasnt gotten any out and doesn&#146;t want him to draw to many this turn. He&#146;s pissed now. He drains for 1 and deploys Epp luke to the DT plaza with a 2/2 scrub with a blaster pistol (Talk about old school!) and moves lando over to them. She drains for 2 Drops Igar and Veers at different sites vaders and db. Drops CC occupation (My deck is not about drains like dark deal - test 1 and menace fades are killers. Its about AO and cc occ direct damage d.d. not D.D.damage hehe :) sorry that was lame as hell ) Hes sees the damage hes about to be dealt fearing next turn Dark Deal but its worse, Much worse. He drains for 2. deploys some scrub to block the drain at the DB. Wrong move buddy. hes drws up to only 12and says where the fu_k is menace fades? says go. Drain for 3 driect damage of 4 and says go. This girl knows her game and Ive told her the in and outs of this deck many times. he moves all his characters in front of vader/Igar Bad move. she drops ardan and hits him with drain of 3 and another 4 direct damage and snipers luke with a DM/TR and a 2 battles. She hits lando and the scrub gets a$$rapped. cleared now on his side of the site.  He knows hes fu_ked now seeing a drain of 6, Direct damage of 8 he draws up his last 15 cards . He would have been had 1 left but not after she was going to something else too.<br>
 <br>
FW 37 (4+58)<br>
<br>
Game 3 She didnt say his name or his rank but I know he or the TD usually win the things while she usually goes 2-2 <br>
I dont know what he was playing but he game her 3 force so i dont know what the hell it was. I&#146;ll tell ya, this girl made NO scrub mistakes this game and got even luckier too.<br>
<br>
She grabs the Executor B4 activating this time. then plays an imperial command to get Piett. Then she activates and finishes activating and pulls Ex:DB Bespin and Evader/Monnok. The Cheaply deployed Admiral inspects how things are running in the DB of his ship. Piette grabs Merrejk who joins his CO and looks in the starcharts for Fondor and locates it for his boss. She deploys a 1/0 interior site . and draws her 1 and its an ImpCommand and says go. He starts activating and she plays Imp command for The Blue Bad A$$. The Grand Admiral Thrawn himself. He finishes and he searches for a db (I think it was the Home One DB) She mentioned it in her email of this game I might get around t including but reading 1 game longer than this TR and editing might not allow it. He draws and says go. She Pulls CC:DB and CC Occ and uses Monnok lost even though he only had a small hand just to see if she could pull of this usually suicidal move and she had saved 1 and he said &quot;Saved 1? Damn. This move was to drop a lone 1/1 tie to Fondor so she could drain for 1 and drop her AO which she did. Played another Impcommand for chiraneau so he just mumbled looked at the 1 force and I assume he was thinking about the MM for ghhhk or the barrier and wasnt happy (heres a girl who he usually beats in first place and a nice dif i quess he was a little shook up because she was not to be messed with on that day (it was yesterday)   <br>
and dropped Igar to the DB and said go still leaving force. He pulled some stuff (sorry about the lack of detrail on his part; she talked about her game) and dropped Boushh to the the 1/0 so I guess he was using yoda stews. and put Anakins Lightsaber on her and an epp with gun Lando or Hanto drain for 2 and says and lando in front of Igar and says go. (I wish I knew what the hell he was doing) She dropped Xixor  infront of boussh and wep leved her stick. after pulling stuff (she left this out too) and battles and they tie. He moves Igar in front of Leia and Xixor to the DB and says go. He does drops an EJ lando and initates at vaders site &quot;React&quot; Dlots and saber Leia misses but Vader hits boushh and Rebekah draws a 4 to his 2 Bye Leia and 6. He decides that if he cant bounce Xixor and she has a MM for Ghhhk he cant draw destiny and will be screwed. So he transits over to Home 1 DB and says go. She drains for 3 and hits him with 1 direct damage. She deploys Executor with thrawn to Fondor wnd did a DM/TR just to recycle the 6 and moves executor to bespin. He Sees she has left 1 force left and says to hell with it and deploys Grand Moff Wedge In Red Sq. 1, but didnt battle WTF? this is what killed him. if he hadbattled he might have made her get rid of the ghhhk but i think he had something up his sleeve that he didnt want barriered (BARRIER FAKEOUTS WIN GAMES!!!!!!!!) she  drops some sites,  veers and ardan - I have taken out ardan but she didnt for some reason or the other. and drops CC Occ looking at 8 direct damage next turn. She says good game when she deploys bossk in hounds tooth and he said did you forget about Red Squardon 1 game txt? She said nope, forget about lateral damage? Lateral damage wedge and tallon roll bye bye wedge. power 14 to 0 next turn drain of 5 dd of 8 he says fu_k and starts to draw up and she says Pu$$y. so he decides to stick it out he cant do anything and she kills him next turn.   <br>
FW 22 (6+67   <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4 vs  DJ (1500&#146;s) She started the usual EBOX shat and he started MKOS with the usual suspects. She let him set up the audience chamber and prepares to eat the drain of 1 all game. She`d been waiting to get out bacta tank so when he setup Gailid she could send EPP obi on a suicide mission. She gets EBO setup on like 4th turn and drop the Kashyyyk she got in her starting hand, Organized lost and drop 2 X wings to Hoth and Kashyyyk. She didnt have Incom out, but  had another OrgAtt and a barrier so she wasnt to worried. Down comes Virago and Dengar in ship  She barriered Dengar but  had dropped OTE the turn before and he didnt battle, so he lost 2. She couldn&#146;t get xwings for the life of her which has never happened to me when we put it together and I playtested ot. It has only 1 tourney loss for me hope she dosent make it a 3-2 for her! . He packs the audience chamber with hella abyssins. and battles at Kashyyyk. She uses organized anyway so she would only have to lose 1 xwing. On her turn,  drop Incom, a cannon on the xwing that was sitting there so it wouldnt get barriered, 3 more xwings, replace with a squadron, and battle. She shoot down Punishing 1, power pivot Virago  [*** Fu_k! Again? ...2 mkos to shot dengars and 2 power pivot WTF Jim, God rest his soul, WAS strong in the force I guess; I never got to talk to him or play on AIM regretably. ***] and cause 16 battle damage and retakes her drain of 3 there. He drains, Drops Ig88 and an abyssin to the 4th marker where ben and hobbie are just chillin, captures hobbie and she tosses Obi to the tank and he loses the sliced and diced abyssin and crap from hand.Next turn,  drop Zev&#146;s speeder to the docking bay with Commander Luke piloting, Icestorm Iggy, and move Zev from the MPG to the DB, he hops onboard his speeder and luke drives it over to the North ridge to look for their commrade on my next turn. He seems a little pissed at the Ice storm so he dosent drop to hoth anymore, fine with her, but drops a lone abyssin to start draining at the lower passages and I think its about time obi got his old wrinkly a$$ out the tub for long enough to hack the damnit out oh it. She drops Corulag (Damn, where is Kiffex) a couple more xwings to set up a drain of 10 on the next turn and as Obi dries off he sees whats coming and realizes that the drain of ten plus the ensuing battle damage plus the 2 from OTE (he had dropped Bossk in bus to Hoth but got barriered) would kill him quick and he drew up. <br>
<br>
Full win by 19<br>
8 (+89)<br>
Highs: Winning, Icestorm, shooting dengar then power pivoting AGAIN!!!. Always having usless crap to lose to force drains from hand like TK422 and Rebel fleet. Him losing MM and monnok off the top.<br>
Lows: Him drawing up before she had a chance to retrieve with all wings report in.<br>
<br>
She wins the damn thing. Its a good read, but I dont want the ratings, I wasnt there, this one was for her, so I wont do the props and props/slops cause you can pretty much figure it out and i dont know the placing behind her but jeff(her boyfriend) finished 4 out of 17<br>
<br>
Thanks for sticking through this but it isnt an 1/8 of the one she sent me<br>
