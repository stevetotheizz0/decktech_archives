I&#146;m back in the land of people who play Star Wars. After getting back to Texas and @#$%ing around with Justin&#146;s Senate, Hunt Down, WYS, yadda yadda yadda, I say screw it and build my own crap. So what do I build for Light? Revo with SAC! (I&#146;m so goddamn predictable, it&#146;s sick...) Dark remains Senate, just cuz it&#146;s a lot of stuff to remember and fun to play. I build it the way I like it, and with some minor revisions with the assistance of Justin and Jeremy (thanks for the cards man), I&#146;m off to Vancouver. I was mainly going up to visit friends of mine, the tournament was a side thing. Justin seems to be under the impression that it was some dude I was going to see (he&#146;s got these weird fantasys involving him, Stanley Kubrick, and lots of leather products that I wish he&#146;d stop mentioning to me), but her name was April, and he&#146;s probably just jealous, since his last &quot;encounter&quot; wasn&#146;t even his hand, it was a POSTER of his hand above his bed. And it&#146;s pretty damn sad when even a poster breaks up with you. So anyways, after crashing around 5 in the morning, I wake up 4 hours later and my friend April drives me to the tourney. It&#146;s like Wednesday now, the tourney was Saturday, I really don&#146;t remember too much, so this is gonna be really half-assed, but screw it. On to the games. <br>
<br>
Game One: Coruscant-based Revo vs. Gary Lee&#146;s (1625)SYC non-flip Big Blue<br>
<br>
Damn. I&#146;m playing Revo and he starts SYC. Great.....anyways, starting hand includes FIVE friggin&#146; Revo&#146;s and assorted red crap. No characters. No Tunnels. This is gonna be a long game. I start DDTA to stop his Mob Points, but he get Mejerrek there first turn anyway and grabs a system I think. I grab Yogurt from the reserve, and draw frantically for characters. He gets set up in space quick with Thrawn and Chimera and some scrub at Kashyyyk, and Dengar and a Dreadnaught at some other system. I&#146;m drawing for the superfalcon, get the Falcon and Leia, and have a Tunnel Vision. I&#146;ve been dumping Foil Revo&#146;s left and right to his drains while trying to get the Falcon together. Next turn, activate a crapload, tunnel for Han, drop Savrip, drop the superfalcon, battle. He hangs in there though, and the Falcon only lasted a few turns due to a severe lack of Savrip bait on my part. Oh yeah, he also Lat Damaged the Falcon right after I threw away my single Alter like a jackass. (Hey, it HAS been a while...), so anyways, I&#146;m basically playing like crap, and finally halfway through the game I get back up to speed after not playing in a year and go into that Hunter &quot;Must...not...lose...game...&quot; mode-crap. I&#146;ve got JK Luke at his DS DB and other assorted Jedi&#146;s draining elsewhere, and actually get a second Super Falcon going in space, but it&#146;s too late to turn the tide completely, and I lose my first tournament game in over a year to a scrub. Utterly depressing. <br>
<br>
FL by nine.<br>
<br>
Game Two: Senate Lush-style vs. ???&#146;s (sorry man) WYS. <br>
<br>
I was bummed about the first game, so I&#146;m really wanted to rip this guy a new one. And my Senate will do that to WYS. Don&#146;t remember too much from this one, but This Is Outrageous! completely negated his Kessel drain, and Maul and pals romped around on Tatooine while Lotti Doddi partied in the senate all the other slimy politicians. Eh. Told ya I didn&#146;t remember much....<br>
<br>
FW by 23?<br>
<br>
Game Three: Senate Lush-Style vs. Cole &quot;Rabid Wookie&quot; Roche&#146;s Invinco-Luke WYS<br>
<br>
This was similar to game two, except Cole played a hell of a lot better. This game is the exact reason I knew I wanted to add a Dannik Jerriko in my deck for, but forgot about while I was in Texas. Ah well. Cole&#146;s playing mass Rebel Artillery&#146;s and played one second turn after setting up Dash at Kessel. Sense. Don&#146;t think he saw that coming. Mid/late game though, he&#146;s flipped, and I can&#146;t really unflip him, so his interrupts are going through, especially all his friggin&#146; OTE&#146;s, which he&#146;s playing a ridiculous amount of. What really kills me is that I had Allegations of Corruption sitting on the damn table. Ugh. I also forgot that damn &quot;spend three, put back two&quot; text of the Senate for most of the game, but started using it hard at the end game when he&#146;d only have 3 cards in his hand. He did retrieve almost 40 cards during the game, but Maul&#146;s pretty persistent too (since I had 4 of him), and I ended up pulling it out by 8 in a game that took the whole 60 minutes. <br>
<br>
FW by 8.<br>
<br>
Game 4- Coruscant Revo vs. ???&#146;s (sorry man) TDIGWATT<br>
<br>
This was a nice guy, but he was a total scrub. Super Falcon slammed his lone TIE at Cloud City, while JK Luke and Qui-Gon dominated his interior sites. I Revo&#146;d about 4 locations just to add to the drains, since the LS side said &quot;force drain -1&quot; on them. What he managed to get out got Smoked quick. I just out-activated and out-powered him. Simplest way to win.<br>
<br>
FW by 23?<br>
<br>
Game 5- Senate Lush-Style vs. ???&#146;s EBO-X<br>
<br>
Glad I got Passel in my deck...he&#146;s slower setting up than I am, and This Is Outrageous holds off his first drain. By the time he goes for his second, I&#146;m ready for him in space, and Zuckuss and crew take him out. Whatever card that is that gives X-Wings immunity gets Sensed. Really not too many details too this game. <br>
<br>
FW by 26?<br>
<br>
Game 6- Revo vs. Cool tournament director&#146;s AOTBS<br>
<br>
Er, don&#146;t remember this guy&#146;s name either, but he was the TD, and a damn good one at that. He started the Ep I Coruscant along with Imperial City and Xizor, and Presence of the Force on Imp. City. My Revo deck starts JCC with Aim High Combo, Staging Areas Combo, and A Tragedy. Fighting on Coruscant! This should be good. He gets going quick with one of his at least 2 4-LOMs backing up Xizor. I dig out Home One DB, notice my Alter isn&#146;t in my reserve, tunnel for it, dig out Yoda, drop him, and Alter Presence. JK Luke one comes down, gets his text cancelled by 4-LOM, and Oh Switch Off stops the swing against him. My Sense gets Controlled, so 4-LOM lives. For now. More battles ensue, and although he had the early jump on me, I get Master Qui and Luke out again and eventually get control. I also drop the generic DB making it a Coruscant location, Superfalcon to Coruscant, and then (don&#146;t laugh TOO hard...) Coruscant Celebration on his Coruscant, so I actually get some retrieval going this game. The Jedi are regulating the DB&#146;s and there isn&#146;t much he can do. <br>
<br>
FW by 21-23? <br>
<br>
So anyways, I win my first tournament back. Yay. I&#146;ll still drop like a stone though in the rankings, cuz of that first lost though. Oh well. It was a good experience for me to get back up to speed with. I also played Alan &quot;Serpent&quot; Sagan in some pick ups after the tourney, I was really hoping to play him during it, since he&#146;s like 2006. Unfortunately, it didn&#146;t happen. His Podprofit bent over my Senate (which is why I won&#146;t post my Senate yet, still needs work...), but my Revo bent over his Scummy ISB in a long game. Alan came in second in the tourney, mainly due his timed wins. Learn to play faster, Alan...<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
<br>
April, for one hell of a weekend. <br>
Alan, for being a cool guy.<br>
Vancouver, for being a cool city.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
<br>
Me, for forgetting Allegations, throwing away my Alter, and leaving the other half of my damn Little Ceasar&#146;s pizza at the store. That pizza would of made a good dinner...<br>
<br>
Apologies for the lack of names and assorted details, but hopefully you enjoyed this anyway. I may post the decks, but right now they both suck @#$% so I need to modify them some. <br>
