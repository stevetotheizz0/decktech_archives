The decks:<br>
Light:  This deck is almost identical to Matt Lush's Throne Room Revo<br>
deck on Decktech.  I pulled the 2 leader in ships and Savrip for R-3PO,<br>
another grabber, and I Hope She's All Right.  The R-3PO and I Hope She's<br>
All Right function in the same way as the 2 leaders, anti-space, and<br>
don't have the liability of getting beatdown.  The Savrip was pulled<br>
because I needed another grabber, and Masterful Move is a pretty common<br>
card.  Here is the deck in it's entirety.<br>

Dark: A fairly standard Rops deck.  Earlier in the week, I had cut the<br>
Bad Feeling Have I, and go with IAO start to be able to pull the 1/0<br>
docking bays out, which got exchanged with the Wampa Cave and Dagobah<br>
Cave.  This gave me an additional card slot to work with, and Rebel<br>
Barrier is still running rampant, so Blast Door Controls seemed like a<br>
solid choice.<br>

Objective (1):<br>
Ralltiir Operations/In The Hands Of The Empire <br>
<br>
Game 1: LS vs. Space (Coruscant start)<br>
<br>
I don't get an excellent draw, but neither does he. By the 4th turn or<br>
so, I get Premiere Ben and saber draining in the Carbonite Chamber, and<br>
I have revolved both Coruscant and Nal Hutta.  I am activating about<br>
double the force he is, and I soon draw into I Hope She's All Right<br>
(IHSAR).  By now, I have enough characters in hand to handle walkers, so<br>
I deploy Master Luke and EPP Han to the Farm and move the Nudj over to<br>
set up IHSAR next turn.  Next turn he drops Blizzard 2 with a couple<br>
guys and battles.  I think I draw poorly and only manage to kill 1 of<br>
them, I lose Han, and he moves away.  Next turn, I setup IHSAR and play<br>
it safe, and end up with DoS at the Farm, and Luke and Han at the<br>
Swamp.  On his turn, he battles and loses the walker and pilot, and Han<br>
bites it again.  By now, he's being drained for 3 at the Carbonite<br>
Chamber, 1 from DoS at the Farm, and 1 from Master Luke w/ saber at the<br>
swamp, and 1 from IHSAR on each turn.  He's draining for 1 at 2<br>
different systems.  He eventually kills off DoS with another walker and<br>
cancelling IHSAR, but the damage has been done, and I win by about 20.<br>
<br>
Game 2: DS vs. Frank Amador (12th) Dagobah drain with Baragwin tech<br>
<br>
He starts Dagobah and Careful Planning for 2 generic sites.  I get set<br>
up fairly quickly, complete with Search and Destroy, and he gets a slow<br>
start.  But he does get the Baragwin engine going.  He has<br>
Artoo/Baragwin/Hero of a Thousand Devices/Fire Extinguisher out.  Along<br>
with Wise Advice, I can't stop it unless I can Trample the Baragwin. <br>
Meanwhile, I'm slowly draining him at a couple sites and Kashyyyk, but<br>
the Baragwin is really slowing the damage down.  I also manage to get<br>
DLOTS w/ a saber, and Zuckuss in ship to Dagobah.  Zuckuss lands at the<br>
forest to block the Ithorian drain, and DLOTS moves to the Hut.  We run<br>
around a bit on Dagobah, and eventually Yoda and Son of Skywalker stay<br>
put at the hut to face down DLOTS.  The next turn, I activate all but 4,<br>
and pull my lowest destiny out, leaving 3 4s.  This allows to me to cut<br>
Yoda, and clear Son out with attrition.  But he pulls a 5 killing<br>
DLOTS.  I then land Zuckuss at the forest again for an uncontested drain<br>
the remainder of the game.  Now, Frank has to do something off Dagobah. <br>
Soon after he drops an Ithorian with the Baragwin and battles.   I react<br>
over and Trample the Baragwin, and he cancels the battle.  But his<br>
retrieval has been stopped.  Nothing else eventful happens, and he draws<br>
up the remainder of his cards with a few minutes remaining giving me<br>
about a 16 point win, with a rather large hand size.<br>
<br>
Game 3: DS vs. James Bottoms (10th) Hidden Base with miscellaneous<br>
ships, EPPs, and Insurrection boosted 2/2 pilots.<br>
As with many Hidden Base decks, he only manages minor interference (EPP<br>
Luke) to my flipping, but he is taken care by a chicken walker with<br>
AT-ST pilot.  Since he isn't playing beatdown, I manage to safely probe<br>
several systems before finding his Hidden Base and he loses 7 cards to<br>
Security Precautions.  Blast Door Controls enables a couple battles and<br>
clear a couple systems and saving me from being attacked on his turn. <br>
He eventually manages to flip Rops back by clearing one of my sites, and<br>
controlling the system.  But I manage to flip it back the next turn, and<br>
eventually drain him out, along with Search and Destroy damage.  I win<br>
by mid 20s.<br>
<br>
Game 4: LS vs. 'Disco' Dave Nicpon (6th) Big Blue (Defensive Perimeter<br>
start)<br>
He starts Presence of the Force on his Defensive Perimeter.  I get an<br>
early Revo on it, and the next turn Master Luke w/ Saber at his Cantina<br>
Alters the PotF.  He gets a walker set up with a couple guys and EPP<br>
Fett.  I eat the drain for a turn and drop Ben Kenopi w/ Saber and the<br>
Wookie to the Cantina.  Next turn, I Nabrun over, clash Fett, and clear<br>
the rest of his site out plus a couple cards.  Unfortunately for me, Ben<br>
Kenobi got disarmed after the Nabrun, so I'm stuck with 1 saber for the<br>
rest of the game.   He eventually Elises back to the Cantina, then on my<br>
turn I Nabrun back and beat him down, but he Ghhhks.  Then I split my<br>
forces up Han/Luke/Chewie at the Cantina, and Ben/Daughter at the JP:<br>
Entrance Cavern, and setup IHSAR.  Meanwhile, he's been getting some<br>
drains in at Kiffex.  Igar in Tempest 1 come down, but don't draw enough<br>
attrition to take out Ben, so DoS covers, and comes back.  He picks up,<br>
and I win by about 20.<br>
<br>
Game 5: LS vs. Brian Monday (3rd) Rops<br>
<br>
He starts Crush, so I can't Revo until I get a grabber, but I get one on<br>
the first pickup.  I revo his Ice Plains, he Evaders, and I grab it, so<br>
I can re-revolve the Ice Plains, but he has plenty of force, so the<br>
choke isn't extremely effective.  I do manage to get Premeire Ben with a<br>
saber down to Ralltiir.  The next turn he drops a load of guys, and I<br>
Smoke Screen, but I still lose by 10.  I choose to lose 10 and keep him<br>
on the table.  He never manages to get rid of him for the remainder of<br>
the game, and he pretty much avoids him.  I suspect he's only running 4<br>
sites, so if I can keep a 2nd site occupied, he won't be able to flip. <br>
I drop Master Luke at the docking bay.  Then Vader comes down to beat on<br>
Luke for several cards, but Luke stays.  Next turn, EPP Han comes down<br>
and battles, he reacts, and I only kill one guy, and Han bites it, but<br>
Luke moves away.  Meanwhile, Daughter is draining away for 2 at the<br>
Entrance Cavern.  A couple turns later, I drop another EPP Han down ,<br>
and Order to Engage.  Han gets Trampled, but he takes 3 from OtE for a<br>
couple turns.  Luke gets battled a couple times, but he can't draw high<br>
enough to get rid of Luke.  Once I'm convinced he's out of battling<br>
capability, Chewie goes to drain at the Jundland Wastes.  I manage to<br>
drain him out on Tatooine while Ben and Luke run around Raltiir avoiding<br>
DLOTS w/ saber.  I win by about 10.<br>
<br>
Game 6: DS vs. Jonathan Morse (8th) Hologameboard/Balance<br>
<br>
I don't get any 2/0s so I'm limited to my docking bays and Ralltiir<br>
sites, so it's a slow setup.  Eventually, I drop an AT-ST w/ pilot at a<br>
site, and he drops Orrimaarko next door to block the flip.  On my turn,<br>
I drop Blast Door Controls, which he has to read a couple times, then<br>
DLOTS comes down and takes care of Orrimaarko.  My next turn, he throws<br>
2 Rebel Barriers from his hand to the drains, and I flip w/ Ozzel/AT-ST<br>
and Pilot/Vader.  I get out Search and Destroy and get a ship at<br>
Kashyyyk over the next couple turns.  He manages to get rid of Search<br>
and Destroy by shooting Ozzel, and I have to react with the walker, and<br>
have to forfeit the AT-ST pilot, but his site is cleared.  I set up<br>
Decree (negating his Projection bonus on the Holotable) and drop more<br>
guys on Ralltiir.  He tries to challenge the Decree by dropping a<br>
Corvette with a 2 ability pilot, and Gold Leader at Kashyyyk and saves<br>
2.  Next turn, I drop Zuckuss, he reacts with the Spiral, but it gets<br>
Barriered, so he loses the pilot and I lose nothing.  He moves to<br>
Ralltiir, where I drop the Devastator for clean up.  He gets a couple<br>
more guys down to Ralltiir but it's pretty much over at this point, and<br>
I win in the mid 20s.<br>
<br>
I finish up in first as the only undefeated at 12 +120.  It<br>
was a well run tournament, with no major issues.  So I,<br>
Geoff Snider (2nd), along with 120+ other people will get<br>
to sit out day 1 at GenCon.<br>
