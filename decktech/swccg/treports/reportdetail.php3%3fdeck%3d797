Kev harassed me into writing a tourney report, so I figured I might as well<br>
send it here too.<br>
<br>
For light, I was playing a cool Profit Odds deck I've called 'POAS'<br>
<br>
POAS stands for Profit Odds And Stuff (and some half-decent destiny 5 effect<br>
too)<br>
<br>
This is pretty much the deck I played (and won with) at my states, but with<br>
a few changes I reckon it needed.  It was designed for a meta heavy with<br>
Raltiir Ops and Tatooine:Aliens, and throughout the day it had an average<br>
winning differential of over 40.  It worked rather nicely, and owes a lot to<br>
Scott Lingrell's deck 'Juz's Revenge.'<br>

Unknown Type:<br>
       You Can Either Profit By This... / Or Be Destroyed<br>
------------------------------------<br>
Use Tibrin to get back stuff, and once you get Lando out there, you should<br>
be able to draw 3 battle destiny per battle (since they gotta battle due to<br>
Order TO Engage), and you can get Punch It! back every turn you play it.<br>
Throw either Wedge or Romas in as a pilot (Consider playing Toryn if you<br>
need to as well, possible in place of Tawss Khaa or Leesub), and keep yoru<br>
odds total up.  Artoo can do a gift, which will hurt Odds, as will<br>
Signalling for Battle Plan early.  Start Uh-Oh!, thereby preventing the<br>
first turn Hunt Down flip on Jabba's Palace, and don't release Han until<br>
you've got your opponent dead (and retrieve 10 force when needed).  Demotion<br>
messes with Vesden, and try to grab odds.  Plenty of EPPs to send on suicide<br>
runs, especially with Mechanical Failure + Romas to kill those irritating<br>
AT-STs (though Trample is kinda mean)<br>
<br>
Since it is mostly inserts, the force issues against a Tatooine/Tat:JP start<br>
is not such a problem, and Artoo and Luke are both deploy -2.  Use BoShuda<br>
to protect Wioslea or Ardon Crell (who deploys free) or Leesub, and Order To<br>
Engage to evict the Dark Side from the Audience Chamber.<br>
<br>
Little duelling protection, except for Glancing Blow, 'cause that's all you<br>
need with some decent destiny draws, and Glancing Blow is nice with some<br>
beatdown anyway.  Simply don't fight Vader w/ Luke/Obi-Wan if they got Epic<br>
Duel out.  If they do get Mara or someone otu to Jabba's Palace for an early<br>
drain, use Projection and Battle Plan to slow the damage, and once you get A<br>
Gift out there, you shouldn't have a problem.  LITW is very nice against a<br>
HuntDown deck that is lured by the prospective drain of 2 or 3 at Jabba's<br>
Palace.<br>
<br>
Effective use of BoShuda and Uh-Oh! will win you games.<br>
<br>
A change you might look at making is to add in the Hologameboard, and<br>
switching Bacta Tank out for the Savrip, and usign Transmission Terminated<br>
to help protect whatever you leave to drain there.<br>
<br>
Naturally, you start Uh-Oh!.<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>

<br>
Anyway, onto the games:<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1, Light vs someone from Ballarat/Bendigo (i forgot the name)<br>
<br>
He started with Ralltiir Ops, but I got a decent draw, though I did get<br>
2xTransmission Terminated in my opening hand.  I was soon inserting, used<br>
8d8 to complete A Gift (didn't draw Artoo until later), Leesub/Wioslea in<br>
the Audience Chamber with Boshuda, and I got Lando In Falcon and Wedge over<br>
to Raltiir via Tibrin.  He was playing with a bunch of sleens, which he<br>
deployed whenever he deployed a site, but not once got a site from reserve<br>
deck, and never flipped until the end of the game.  He threw a star<br>
destroyer or two at Lando, but the Spiral sped to its rescue, only to die in<br>
the battle.  Some shocking information from Raltiir early in the game<br>
allowed Lando to follow his destiny later, destroying a star destroyer with<br>
a tracked destiny 5.  Inserts finished him off, and I freed Han and did<br>
damage with Profit with Han and EPP Obi at the Audience Chamber, with EPP<br>
Luke and the high destiny aliens and Luke at Jabba's Palace.  In addition,<br>
Lando ran off to Tibrin, while the Tantive 4 went to Raltiir to protest<br>
against the subjugation and to enjoy the power +1 bonus.  :)  I finished the<br>
game with 0 cards in lost pile thanks to the retrieval of 10 force, and him<br>
not force draining once all game.  Vader did make an appearance on Raltiir,<br>
but he got really cranky, and his uncontrollable fury ate him up, especially<br>
knowing that Luke and Obi were on Tatooine, and he wasn't.<br>
Full win by 38 - 2+38<br>
<br>
After this game, having had a chat to some of the other players, I found out<br>
that there were like 10 games with wins by over 30 force - Some real<br>
massacres.<br>
<br>
Game 2, Dark vs Stuart Jones.<br>
We were playing the same Dark decks, which we both knew were really strong.<br>
On the decklist form, Stuart called his version 'If you beat this deck, you<br>
cheated,' which was quite appropriate.  Anyway, in our game, I got a good<br>
draw, holding both Battle Plan and Oppressive Enforcement in hand, and soon<br>
after Twileking for TBHTP to effectively stop his Sense and Alter.  I made a<br>
mistake early on in not flipping my objective when I should have, but in the<br>
end 3 destiny draws of 6 (two deliberate, one after a shuffle) won the game<br>
by 11 force.  Stuart ended up in 6th place.<br>
Full win by 11 - 4+49<br>
<br>
Game 3, Light vs David Huberman<br>
Dave was my apprentice in the beginners tournament last year, and kindly won<br>
a GOTM T-Shirt for me, which was nice.  Basically, my deck was too fast for<br>
his Hunt Down, and I again managed to draw 2 Transmission Terminateds into<br>
my opening hand.   Consequently, he was doing no force loss to me, and my<br>
starships drawing battle by themselves (or with a pilot) and Draw Their Fire<br>
beat up his TIE Defenders.  In the end, I threw down Tibrin and occupied it<br>
to throw more cards to my lost pile so I could retrieve as much as possible<br>
when I freed Han, and I used Obi-Wan and Luke to beat on Mara Jade in the<br>
Audience Chamber when I had no aliens in there.  Resistance was nasty since<br>
he occupied 3 battlegrounds when it came up once (Vader w/ POTF at the<br>
Meditation Chamber), but my starships cleaned up his solitary TIE Defenders.<br>
Full win by 43 - 6+92<br>
<br>
Game 4, Dark vs Rodney Lee<br>
Rod's a pretty decent player, and I think at this stage he was also<br>
undefeated.  However, he deployed EPP Han w/ Chewie and Wedge and the<br>
Tantive 4 to the Death Star, which I ignored courtesy of CHYBC.  Ben and<br>
Luke were slaughtered on Tatooine, and Rodney drew up early to prevent me<br>
from returning my hand (of like 12 cards) with Reactor Terminal.  His deck<br>
was meant to be a massive beatdown, but it simply couldn't drain, especially<br>
after CHYBC.  Once he deployed half his hit force, he simply had no way to<br>
deal with my guys who couldn't be beatdown by a fully fledged EPP team, let<br>
alone half of one.  Ben and Luke got hammered by IG-88 and 4-LOM in<br>
particular - From memory, over the whole tournament, my IG-88 captured 3<br>
Bens and 2 EPP Lukes, which was a good result for him.  And now Chris Janiak<br>
reckons I should remove him...pfft.  Also, Rodney finished the tournament in<br>
5th place.<br>
Full win by 24 {but i still had 12 cards in hand....} - 8+116<br>
<br>
Game 5, Dark vs Luca Costanzo<br>
As it turns out, I was supposed to play my light deck here, but before the<br>
parings were announced, Kev asked me to pick a hand (one of which contained<br>
a dark pin and the other a light pin), I picked the dark pin, and assumed<br>
that that was to be side, but apparently it was supposed to be Luca's.<br>
Either way, I played Dark here, and Luca's Hidden Base w/ EPPs and Figrin<br>
simply couldn't deal with a 3 walkers and Choke Vader chasing them whereever<br>
they went on the ground.  Obi-Wan borrowed Yoda's Gimer Stick, and EPP Luke<br>
sliced my only Vader once, but he was successfully Evadered, tracked back to<br>
hand, and re-deployed to ensure that the Damage from Order To Engage was<br>
negligble.  Tarkin and a couple of other dudes went to drain at a 2/0 with a<br>
POTF, and Search And DEstroy sped the game up - Eventually, Luca was<br>
effectively draining for 0, and I was draining for 6 once I killed off Obi,<br>
and that was it.  Fortunately, Yoda's Gimer Stick kept turning the site he<br>
was at into a non-battleground site, so S+D kicked in even though Obi was<br>
out.<br>
Full win by 13 - 10+129<br>
<br>
I had been in 1st place since the end of game 3, but it was now into the<br>
business end of the toruney - One last game, against Daniel Robertson<br>
<br>
Game 6, Dark vs Daniel Robertson<br>
He also started, like Rodney, with Obi-Wan's Hut and Tosche Station, so I<br>
decided to let him do something.  He waited longer than I could, so i<br>
deployed the Avenger, Devastator, Dengar in Ship and Boba in Ship with<br>
pilots to Coruscant, and POTF too.  Next turn, I took over the Cantina with<br>
a bunch of dudes, and he was draining for 0.  Ben and Luke were mucking<br>
about on Tatooine running back and forth, as I was soon able to get a<br>
walker, plus Commadner IGar to Obi's Hut for two battle destinies. He<br>
eventually deployed the Falcon w/ Leia and Captain Han, so I had to battle<br>
it, and he played Punch It and I Know to add destiny.  I forfeited a few<br>
dudes, and he lost EPP Leia to attrition, and he ran away.  Consequently,<br>
Zuckuss in Mist Hunter with a tracked destiny 6 cleared out Han, and<br>
thereafter I was able to drain for free, while he was curtailed by Battle<br>
PLan and also the simple fact that there was nowhere from him to drain.<br>
Full win by 18 - 12 + 147.<br>
<br>
At the end of the tournament, I was ahead of Donno (the only other<br>
undefeated player) by 40 diffential, so that was that.  There was talk of a<br>
7th or 8th game, but we simply ran out of time.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it was good fun, and only one person dropped out, which was good.<br>
Kev ran a good tournament, and as far as I know, only California has been<br>
larger (with 57 people)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Stu for building a bloody good dark deck<br>
Everyone I played for 6 decent games<br>
Kev, for not making a single bad ruling on any of my games<br>
Dono for coming second<br>
Scott Lingrell for the original inspiration for the light deck<br>
Everyone else for turning up<br>
Russel Crowe for putting in a good performance in Gladiator, which I went<br>
and saw with Rod afterwards<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
The venue owners who needed us out by 5pm<br>
Decipher for not releasing a CRD<br>
The train line for producing a timetable that makes it look like there's a<br>
7:10am train when there isn't (and for confusing me into thinking Sunday was<br>
Saturday)<br>
<br>
Have a good one,<br>
