Since it was so far away we did the best thing to prepare for the tourney, ignore Starwars all together.  As the months passed the Starwars games were few and in-between until about 3 weeks till D-day.  <br>
<br>
We received word from Doug Taylor (Red 4) our local Starwars guru that there would be a Starwars gathering of sorts at his place with the top players from Endor being there to playtest so of course Team P.O.W. would be there to show our stuff.  <br>
<br>
The Next step involved making decks and testing them out against the Meta and Net decks so we built a few and tested them against them.  For light the deck we figured we should beat would be Bottomly&#146;s WYS and the Brangus Deck or HDPodracing.  Well altogether my decks sucked.  I built a Hdracing deck w/numbers that could not beat WYS or Hiddenbase, and I built a YMSYL deck that I had played in a previous tourney that killed space decks and had a good chance against wys.  So for dark my deck was still up in the air.  For Light side I still had a RST racing deck put together but I felt that it was not solid enough.  So I built what everyone else builds you guessed it WYS but w/ Harvests.  So playtesting proceeded and I felt that the WYS deck was good but I didn&#146;t like playing it so back to the drawing board.<br>
<br>
I really wanted to play Mains and good interrupts to go with it but I also wanted a fast start to go with it so was born my Throne Room Mess.  It started Throne room w/ Scrambled Transmission, Don&#146;t Do that Again and Your insight serves you well.  It ran 9 Twix&#146;s, double of the Slave Quarters for 3po and a Heavy Sense and Alter Package.  This deck was a beast in Playtesting, so I felt I had a chance with light and dark I would decide @ Doug&#146;s house the day before the tourney.<br>
<br>
Friday Comes around and I Go watch American Pie 2 (let me tell you this movie is freaking hilarious you should stop reading this and go watch it) After the movie I go back to my house and see a few cars lined up down the road so I figured my roommate was having a party.  When I start to open the front door I see a Sobe bottle cap and the message on the cap says &quot;Stifflers Mom&quot; this cap was taped to the front of my door kind of weird.  So I enter my house to see a drunken orgy going on so of course I have to join in the festivities.  <br>
<br>
The rest of the night consisted of me drinking two &quot;Stifflers Mom&quot; (drink my roommate made up for the night and was well named) a few shots of JD, a couple of Icehouses, half a Mickey&#146;s 22 and Half a bottle of Sangria.  Needless to say I was in Prime Starwars playing mood.  I crash around 5:00am and wake up around 10:00 to the sounds of Sexy @#$% w/ Black tank top and Black shiny Bra (this was her name for herself during the night) puking in my toilet.  So I get up go get my haircut come back take shower load up cards and go to get team P.O.W.<br>
<br>
Stop 1 newest member of team P.O.W. Greg&#146;s house we gather his stuff up load it in back of my car and call Mike Peralta up and he is still sleeping (he was also at wild orgy @ my house but hell I was up @ 10 so why should he be sleeping @ 1 PM) so I do the most tactful thing and tell his mom to wake him up.  So we finally pick up Mike get gas have Mike get directions from the e-mail and hit the road around 3 PM.  The drive to Doug&#146;s house was uneventful until we get close to Doug&#146;s house and Mike forgot to write down what exit to take off the freeway so after getting lost for around 15 min almost getting in a car wreck we finally arrive at Doug&#146;s around 5 PM.  This would start Starwars night from Hell.<br>
<br>
Notable players at Doug&#146;s for testing were John Hawkins and Chris Denoma (the founders of speed deal and the Brangus deck despite what you have heard), Doug Harvilla (who didn&#146;t go but tested with us anyway) Joe Olson (who didn&#146;t bring any decks because he is scarred to loose to me and left early anyway) Peter Sundholm (the wookie a really great guy to play against and probably one of the nicest) Our &quot;State Champ&quot; Nick Jones (well not really notable but he was there) and of Course Doug Taylor and his son Andrew (7 or 8 year old Starwars player that is pretty good for his age.  Well needless to say playtesting went on all night with My light loosing only to Speed deal played by Hawkins and Brangus played by Denoma (these guys are damn good players and have some new tech that just rocks but I wont spoil any of it incase they decide to perfect it for worlds) and my dark was still up in the air with both decks loosing once each.  <br>
<br>
5:00 am up for 19 hours start trip to Canada<br>
6:30 am up for 20.5 hours get breakfast at some random store <br>
8:00 am Border crossing into Canadia that&#146;s right Canadia<br>
<br>
(Canadia is no place to live you cant read roadsigns the speed limit is too slow and they have flashing green lights,  there a too many hookers (maybe that&#146;s a good thing) and there are to many McDonalds)<br>
<br>
at the boarder crossing Hawkins said he forgot his ID which could suck so we decide to play it cool<br>
<br>
Canadian: Citizenship?<br>
Us: USA<br>
Canadian: Where you Going?<br>

Me yes<br>
Them: (looking at us suspiciously again) Pass along (in the words of Don Kitzman &quot;These are not the Droids were looking for&quot;)<br>
<br>
Well needless to sy Doug Taylor gets stopped by the border patrol for being a Petaphile (he has around seven kids under 18 in his car) and Chris (don&#146;t remember last name) got pulled over also don&#146;t know why..so affter about half an hour we are on our way again&amp;#8230;<br>
<br>
8:30 up for 22.5 hours head to Hyperlight in Vancouver.<br>
10:00 am up for 24 hours arrive to tourney scene.<br>

His turn zuckuss comes down and I miss the hack and draw a site so zuckss stays and I loose obi so he wins the battle at the throne room.  Well next turn he puts the emperor at throne room and my turn.  <br>
<br>
This is where I screw up I still have about 25 cards or so to his about 10 so I should get the win no problem right.    WRONG    I decide to alter Presence on the throne room and deploy twass and a bommar monk to the slave quarters to increase my damage.  Well on his turn he puts ig-88 and dengar down and cant battle.  My turn I look at my hand I have a nabrun leids some other crap but no characters.  I look at cauracaunt sites and oh damn they are interior (at the time I thought they were which lost me the game) so I threepio my nabrun leids away an no characters so I decide to battle at slave quarters so he cant do any more damage to me.  I battle, first mistake, the monk does not participate in offensive battles ,second mistake, so he captures twass shoot the droid an shmi so I loose all plus 14.  Well His turn he battles the droid and I loose droid and 6.  He drains me out two turnes later for a win by 3.<br>

My turn mara w. stick to lone elom and Darh Maul to vaders site.  Battle w/ mara hit elom draw a 6 so it is the elom and 8 I think.  His turn he puts bwing and lando in falcon at Kessel.  My turn I put down zuckuss in MH battle he looses lando and I loose 1 or 2.  Well game ends soon after.  Well when the game finishes I start talking to the kid and suffle my whole deck together before I count the differental.
