<br>
The Las Vegas Grand Slam was something I was really looking forward to in quite a long<br>
time.  The Event was held at Vacation Village Hotel and Casino.  The room we had there<br>
was not that bad, and it had a good sound system to direct people to there tables and the<br>
event was ran pretty smoothly with not to many problems.  As we know YJ is a part of the<br>
Grand Slam, but we care little of that here, but I still like the game so I played in that. <br>
And out of 28 people I came in first place for that, so that was cool.  I was a little high<br>
from that and was now really looking forward to the Starwars Event.  Chris Hines(Gold 8)<br>
ran the YJ Event alone pretty good, but he knew he was going to need help for the SW<br>
Event.  He had Brad Bedlion and Robert Corbett help him out and now is a good time to<br>
say good job guys.  Chris really appreciated it.<br>
<br>
We had a total of 52 people show up.  I was really happy with this attendance and some of<br>
the names that came were great.  Some I haven’t seen since D-con so this was going to be<br>
interesting.  The Arizona crew, had Mike Girard, Mike Sinclair, Dj Andrews, Brian<br>
Garrison, and Jay Web, and I think others, but please forgive me for not remembering<br>
ALL.  Josh Martin came to just report on the event, but decided he did not want to play. <br>
Kyle Craft and Matt Reicks came all the way down from Colorado.  Utah had about 3, but<br>
sorry don’t know who.  And California had the biggest Crew beside all the locals that<br>
were there.  James Lafferty, Eric Bruen, Ryan Schueller, Ben Vanbuskiyi(sp?), Tom<br>
Mascara, John Borders, Greg Miller, and many, many others that I can not think of right<br>
now.  And of course we had all the good Local players show up for this event.  I will<br>
mention them, because I know they just like to be mentioned :)  Brandon “Droid Pimp”<br>
Gravo, Kris “VegasPimp” Lavigne, Ted Hansen, Dan “Mystical” Christy, John “The Man”<br>
Spadora, Shane Watner, Noah, Jeff, and the rest know who you are just let me know<br>
continue with the good stuff.<br>
<br>
Well we planned on starting at 1:00 PM, but we all know how that goes.  There were<br>
some who didn’t have there Decklist ready so it took a little while, but eventually we<br>
started around 1:40 I believe, maybe a little sooner, but I was ready.  This was one of the<br>
few tournaments that I did not have to face anyone from Vegas.  I loved that.  Everyone I<br>
played was from Out of Town and I really liked getting to know some of the ones I didn’t<br>
already know.  I tested so many decks with Ted Hansen, and Chris Hines, for this<br>
Tourney.  We went back and forth with what was good, and what people may play or not. <br>
I was trying some wacky Ideas with them.  Both agreed that no one will expect Dark<br>
numbers, but I didn’t want to play that.  However Ted did play it with much success. <br>
That deck went Undefeated.  I wanted to go with something strong and proven.  So I<br>
decided to play with Profit on the Light Side and Hunt Down/with Duel on the Dark Side. <br>
I will post my new version of the Profit that I played and my Hunt Down sometime later<br>
this week.  But if you read all this mumble jumble then thanks and now off to the games.<br>
<br>
Game 1 My DS vs Rudy Rojas’ Hidden Base (Rating 1551)<br>
<br>
I love to play hidden base with this deck.  I start Presence on the Med Chamber and he<br>
starts, Wise Advice.  Now everytime I see this for some reason, I am thinking he is playing<br>
HB Numbers and wants to grab, my Torture of something.  I get Vader and No torture in<br>
my starting hand, so I am a little worried.  I activate draw a couple and save to deploy<br>
Vader next turn.  We both loose from Visage and the first card he loose’ is a ability 2<br>
scrub pilot so now my worry of inserts are over.  When he start deploying his systems I<br>
start deploying my ships.  I monnoked him to notice that he didn’t have the super falcon in<br>
his hand so there was little to worry about.  So I went ahead and left a Dreadnuaght only<br>
at 2 different systems and Boba fett in ship and another.  Visage was taking some really<br>
good stuff off the top of his deck.  He deploys to battle on one Dreadnuaght, and I use<br>
Med Chambers Text to add a destiny. I subtract 2 from his battle destiny using Their Fire<br>
has gone.... game text to survive and he loses his ship.  He got brave towards the end<br>
game and put Obi in front of vader making me flip.  I think he had Duel protection in his<br>
hand So I didn’t duel him.  Later I find out he didn’t and just wanted to die to end the<br>
game, but either way I won this one. FW by 26.<br>
Score: 2 (+26)<br>
<br>
Highlights: I was glad to see he wasn’t playing numbers.  And have control all game.<br>
<br>
Lowlights: Not dueling when that would have been cool, win or lose my diff would have<br>
been the same.  but I was playing it safe I guess.<br>
<br>
Game 2 My LS vs Ryan Schueller’s Hunt Down without Duel (Rating 1872)<br>
<br>
This game started kind of bad for me.  I couldn’t find Master Luke or Ben for awhile.  But<br>
it seemed like he was having some problems also.  We were both loosing to Visage for a<br>
while and he was Draining me for 3 with Presence at Tat: JP with Mara and Vader there. <br>
Soon I put Boushh in front of that drain and was still trying to catch up.  When I freed<br>
Han and retrieved my force, I started finding things I needed to win this game.  I battled<br>
one of his walkers with Mechanical Failure on it, he had to take 12 battle Damage from<br>
that, but with 2 pilots helped out with IAO didn’t really cause to much damage.  But I felt<br>
in control of this game.  He was hurting from OTE, because he didn’t want to battle me,<br>
knowing I had stuff to hurt him.  All of a sudden he manages to get rid of OTE and puts<br>
Bubo in front of Ben, Chewie, Lando, Liea, MLuke, and Han.  That is 6 people  there<br>
chances were pretty slime to eat han.  I didn’t have a Fallen Portal in Hand which sucked,<br>
and guess want happened.  I shuffled and he choose randomly and chose Han.  No of<br>
course he didn’t have to battle me or stay there to stop the drain so he splits to two<br>
different locations.  I can’t drain or cause any damage right now, but he has finally find a<br>
system and started drain for 2 at that.  I finally get Han back out there, but with little<br>
success, because he gets Trampled right away, and he has built up a force to finally battle,<br>
and I play Gift of a mentor to make him loose some, but not enough.  In the end Ben was<br>
alone and he beat he up just a little and I ran out of cards.  FL by 12<br>
Total Score: 2(+14)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Having Control at Mid game.<br>
<br>
Lowlights: Losing Control when Han was pick out of 5 others to be eaten by Bubo, what<br>
is up with that.<br>
<br>
As you can imagine this brought me a little down.  I couldn’t be to upset, because it<br>
wasn’t like I made any mistakes, it just happened.  Oh well I move on.  I go to see how<br>
some of the others players are doing and find out the Kyle lost his first game to Eric, but<br>
he now has this look on his face that he will not lose to another.  James also Lost his first<br>
game to a Local, that James says was some bad luck.  I thought wow this is going to be<br>
interesting.  I was like Kyle at this point, just wanted to continue and focus on the next<br>
few games.<br>
<br>
Game 3 My LS vs Mike Sinclair’s Ralltiir Ops (Rating 1720)<br>
<br>
Now I tested this deck against Ralltiir a lot.  In fact I thought I was going to see nothing<br>
but Ralltiir so I was ready for many of the different versions.  However Mike proved that<br>
this was going to be a tough game from the beginning.  During this game I had the worst<br>
draw of my life.  I had up to 22 cards in hand and had only 3 characters, but they were all<br>
Luke so this did me no good at all.  He did monnok me hoping he would get all of my<br>
Harvest, but when he looked at my hand he noticed I was playing with none, but he did<br>
manage to get 2 of my sense’s.  Which kept me from battling since I couldn’t sense any<br>
react’s.  He also played with the Desert and I wasn’t going to go there for the life of me,<br>
we all no what can happen if we do.  I did not notice if he had a Sandwhirl in his deck, but<br>
I wasn’t going to take any chances.  I was taking force drains like crazy, and since my<br>
hand was so big, I lost everything from my hand and put only High destiny’s in my lost<br>
pile.  Finally I started to find my characters, I had Luke on Ralltiir early, even before he<br>
flipped hoping I can cause damage.  I did a little with a mechanical failure, and then when<br>
he tried to cancel it he failed, so next turn when he drained I surprised assaulted him for<br>
only 3 more cards I think.  I finally found Ben which then he rescued Han and then I<br>
retrieved all the High Destiny’s I put in the lost Pile.  I did get Leia Undercover on Ralltiir<br>
and another Undercover over there to slow down some drains.  Ben and Han are at the<br>
Tat: JP and are draining for 1 with Obi saber.  Fallen Portal helped get rid of Mara which<br>
was good and Clash Helped me a little to.  He loose an Altar toward the End game, and<br>
this is when I deploy OTE.  This is what helped me catch up to my loses.  He would battle<br>
Luke on Ralltiir and I would Narrow Escape to where he had People so he would have to<br>
lose 3 force.  Vader got Clash so he would have to lose some more force.  Lando was<br>
only in the Cantina Draining for one and making him lose, because my objective was<br>
flipped.  With me making him lose force like crazy, and him Draining in Space like crazy,<br>
and when he grabbed Narrow Escape it was getting close.  This game came down to the<br>
wire, it is right up there with some of the best games I have ever played.  This game was<br>
awesome I will never forget it.  Anyway I squeeze out the win...so FW by 1<br>
Total Score: 4(+15)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Playing such a close game, it made it so much fun, and I didn’t see any mistake<br>
played by either of us...it was good.<br>
<br>
Lowlights: Drawing 22 cards and still no people...that sucked.  And only winning by 1 was<br>
a lowlight, because it probably took me out of the final chances...lets move on<br>
<br>
Well now I am getting a little nervous.  I am thinking to myself that, “first my light loses<br>
then it only wins by 1, this is going to be a tough day for light side”.  Or so I think.  But<br>
just to calm my nerves a little I walk over to the Bar and order me a Beer.  I down that<br>
real quick and am now ready for the next game.<br>
<br>
Game 4 My DS vs Greg Miller’s Mwyhl Falcon Deck...(Rating 1769)<br>
<br>
Now Greg seems like he is one cool guy.  There is one thing I do know, and that is he is<br>
the best young player I met in a long time.  He starts Battle Plan and I start Presence on<br>
the Med Chamber.  When I see his Starting location I think Super Falcon right away.  He<br>
was losing to Visage right from the beginning, since I had Vader in opening draw.  The<br>
card he lost from the top was Transmission Terminated which kind of sucked, but it was<br>
good for me.  He did manage to get out another one so he did kill it soon, of course I did<br>
have more Visage to put out.  Also he got the light side Holo Table out early and then I<br>
was like YEP the is SuperFalcon.  Right away I was looking for Come Here you Coward. <br>
At one time he drains me for 2 at Kessel, since I converted his Kessel with mine and I lose<br>
for the top.  Guess what, it was Come here you Coward.  I told be there that was probably<br>
game for him, and he said he could get around that anyway.  I was like...ok.  All this time<br>
I already had Image of a Dark Lord in my hand but I was waiting to him to go there first. <br>
He didn’t until after our space battle.  I was saving a lot of force to battle the superfalcon. <br>
I had Ig in ship, the buss, Dreadnaught, and Boba in slave 1.  So I monnoked to see what<br>
he had in hand.  During the Monnok I happened to get 3 On the Edges out of his hand.  I<br>
was like...Awesome....this is so HUGE....this made up for losing the Coward card. <br>
Anyway I make a note what he has in hand, which is Punch it and Out of Nowhere.  The<br>
turn before this I set up my destiny so I knew what I was going to draw.  So I deploy<br>
everyone except Boba in ship....so that is 3 destiny for me.  And since Vader was at the<br>
Med Chamber I will be able to subtract 2 from every Destiny draw he makes.  And since<br>
he had Captain Han, with Out of Nowhere and Punch it gets 5 destinys, which I subtracted<br>
2 from each and I draw a 4, 7, 5...I believe that was game for me, but he still had some<br>
fighting force.  I was after all losing to fury deployed on Vader for a good portion of the<br>
game, and he did deploy Projection of a Skywalker on the LS Holo Table to get a Drain,<br>
but this was when I deployed Image of a Dark Lord to battle and I subtracted his destiny,<br>
so my guys stays and his goes.  With Visage taking his toll on him it was soon over.  FW<br>
by 19<br>
Total Score: 6(+34)<br>
<br>
Highlights:  I guess playing like I knew every card in his deck.<br>
<br>
Lowlights: Taking down such I cool kid it would have been nice to see him in the top 10<br>
<br>
Well you would think that I was starting to relax, well not quite.  I still needed some more<br>
beer to warm my blood.  I to warm my hands, which were a little cold for some reason. <br>
So I go back to the bar and order a 24 oz beer which was like Ice Cold so my hands just<br>
got colder, but I enjoyed it.  I went to see how everyone else was doing.  Girard just lost<br>
to some local player who he said had a great draw.  And who was making drains cost a<br>
little to much.  Kyle was coming back by winning all of his games, and James was also<br>
coming back.  It was Ben and Eric Bruen who were the only undefeated players so far and<br>
they ended up playing each other twice in the end...here is what comes next for me.<br>
<br>
Game 5 My DS vs Tom Mascari’s Mwyhl x-wings Swarm Deck...(Rating 1904)<br>
<br>
Well the first thing Tom says is oh great you are here to beat me again.  He says that<br>
because he always gives me a hard time about beating him in the Wild Card at DCon,<br>
because if he beat me then he would have been in Worlds.  I like this guy.  He is so cool,<br>
and he makes me laugh.  Anyway he start with Yarna and I start usual against this deck.  I<br>
think...you are not playing Astroid Santuary are you.  Of course he wasn’t which I learned<br>
quickly when he started deploying.  Now at this time, Tom was so tired, it looked liked he<br>
was going to fall asleep during the game.  I didn’t feel like he was playing his best.  He<br>
said there were up way to late...I guess so.  Anyway One battle in space where he had to<br>
lose 17 cards, because I lateral damaged, was huge for me.  I later Monnoked to see<br>
where I can go safely.  I was draining in space at some of mine and at some of his<br>
locations.  The deck he was playing was also the same deck that was playing at the Top<br>
table which I thought was interesting.  But with my ability to subtract his destiny I was in<br>
so much control.  He did however cancel Visage early and I was unable to find another. <br>
But he could not catch up to the force loss.  FW by 33<br>
Total Score 8(+67)<br>
<br>
Highlights:  Winning by so much when I needed it most.  I needed to get back to sheet<br>
chances.<br>
<br>
Lowlights: Having Tom so Tired and him making a mistake to not save force to play<br>
alternatives to fighting.<br>
<br>
I am pumped, I do think I need any more beer until afterwards.  Which we might do<br>
something later with the group that traveled.  James wants to gamble a little in between<br>
this round since we both finished so early.  Things are starting to get interesting, because<br>
the two undefeated people just timed out with Ben being on top.  Ben only need one more<br>
drain of 2 to win the game so it was crazy.<br>
<br>
Game 6 My LS vs Dan Lujan’s CCT/with SAC...(Rating..1939)<br>
<br>
Well Dan and I see each other at big tournaments like this, but for some reason we never<br>
ended up playing until now.  First thing when I see his objective, I am like...where this is<br>
interesting.  I give him Orr, for a captive and start with Wise Advice like I do every game<br>
with this deck.  Since Clayton just won the California State Champs with CCT Skrillings<br>
Numbers I was thinking he brought the same thing.  So I held onto Don’t forget the<br>
Droids until I knew for sure.  As it turned out he wasn’t.  In fact the deck was very well<br>
put together, and it had some profit hate in there.  I was losing force like crazy to drains,<br>
and was once again looking for cards I needed to catch up.  At one point I thought I was<br>
going to beat up on Dengar, because he was with Vader.  So I deployed Master Luke and<br>
gave him his Saber.  Then played Clash on Vader, he Sensed and I grabbed the Sense and<br>
played Altar.  Then he just YAB on Luke so I never did get the beat down.  He then on<br>
his turn Elis Dengar to the Cantina to drain for 2 and then elised him back to safety.  I<br>
though wow maybe I can catch him in an important time and use quite a mercenary. <br>
Anyway he was in so much control of this game.  I still have not freed Han, and he had<br>
like about 6 people in the audience chamber protecting him.  Boushh never came out this<br>
game I was really wondering what happened to her.  Anyway I move Ben, Master Luke,<br>
Chewie, Lando over to the Chamber, because frankly this is my only choice.  He deploys<br>
Djas, and some other person, he already had Dr. E, Mara Jade, Vader, and Jabba there,<br>
and 4Lom.  He battles and I play Weapon Lev on Mara, but somehow he has enough to<br>
stack some sense and get rid of that card.  But he couldn’t get rid of Gift of a Mentor. <br>
This saved me somehow.  We went back and forth battling there, but in the end I had the<br>
chamber.  I could not believe it.  I then freed Han and retrieved 10 force and starting<br>
finally making him lose cards other than just battling.  He had to lose 5 the first turn...I<br>
spread, then 8 the next and then it was to much for him.  He elis some over and YES I got<br>
to use QAM to put them to the lost pile and that was it.  I don’t know how I did it, but I<br>
reach up real high and pull out a win :)  FW by 12<br>
Total Score 10(+79)<br>
<br>
Highlights: Yes I won...I know I will be getting a sheet for sure.  And coming back when I<br>
thought it was over.<br>
<br>
Lowlights: Well I didn’t win Huge to be in the final, but it was fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well what a tournament this was.  I came in 4th place overall which I thought was great<br>
considering the day I had.  This was so much fun and now I am looking forward to the<br>
regional.  It was interesting that the top 2 players timed out Again.  But this time Eric won<br>
the timed victory.  So it looks like they kind of screwed each other.  So we had no one<br>
person who was Undefeated and it was James Laffety, who came in first overall.  Jim<br>
didn’t want to play in the final, because he just wanted to gamble and see more of Vegas. <br>
So he let the Second place person which was Ryan Schueller pick which sheet he wanted<br>
then went to party.  Anyway here are the Top 10, because for right now that is all I have.<br>
<br>
1. James Lafferty (San Diego)<br>
2.Ryan Schueller (LA)<br>
3. Kyle Craft (Colorado)<br>
4. Tim Guzman (Me, Las Vegas)<br>
5. Eric Bruen (LA)<br>
6. Ben Vanbuski (SD)<br>
7. Christopher Hood (Las Vegas)<br>
8. Brandon Gravo (Las Vegas)<br>
9. Patrick Garcia (Cali)<br>
10. Ted Hansen (Las Vegas)<br>
<br>
