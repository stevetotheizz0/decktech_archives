<br>
Prologue- I had a tough time trying to work out a few minor <br>
details of the Dagobah Regionals. I was losing interest in <br>
the game and was trying to save money for other stuff. My<br>
friends Dan and Lee were very interested in going though so <br>
I figured I'd at least think about it. I was strapped for<br>
cash and decided that if I was gonna go I'd try to make them<br>
pay for most of the journey. I ordered Death Star 2 boxes <br>
but they came 6 days after I expected them so I was a bit <br>
crippled for playtesting. I decide that I know I won't <br>
have the deck(s) fully tuned so I'm just gonna flat out<br>
play the opponent to get the win. I was thinking Lightside <br>
Weapons and Musicians. I decided to mess around with the new<br>
DS2 Objectives and gave them a fair shot. ::Speed up to Day<br>
before Regional::. We arrive in Jacksonville in very good <br>
time. The downside is that the hotel jerks me around<br>
saying : a.) they didn't have any reservations in my name <br>
b.) you need to be 21 to get a room and c.) I could try my<br>
luck down the street. So I could either go find another<br>
place or wait until any of my friends over 21 would arrive<br>
and help me rent a room. So we finally find a place to give<br>
us a deal and we finally start playtesting and using the <br>
group think. We are all playing the same Dark Side and Lee<br>
breaks form from our Light Side. <br>
<br>
Decks : <br>
<br>
LS- &quot; For 3 years the system kept me down as forfeit fodder<br>
but now I'm the supafly!&quot; - Uses New Wedge to the fullest<br>
Matching pilots and Weapons. <br>
<br>
DS- &quot; Burn Him Before Me&quot; - Decided to tap around with this<br>
new objective to see how it does. Battle heavy and flexible<br>
always sounds good to me. <br>
<br>
Game 1 : &quot; Burn Him Before Me&quot; vs. Gabe Alonso's Profit<br>
<br>
I start Arrest Order , Mobil Points , and Crush. I also get<br>
Mara Jade and Evazan to start at his Audience Chamber. He<br>
starts Goo Nee Tay which I figure is kinda risky since I<br>
could get Emperor and Alter it right off the bat or even<br>
try with Mara. Ah well I get rolling and deploy Emperor to<br>
DS2 Docking Bay and kick out Rendili too. He drops Master<br>
Luke right off the bat versus Mara and Evazan , battles ,<br>
and draws a 5 ( Narrow Escape ) to my 1 so I lose them <br>
both. I deploy Commander Igar and Tempest 1 to JP and he <br>
later flips and retrieves. Ben Kenobi comes down and its <br>
gonna be hard to get rid of General Solo. He kicks out <br>
Bargaining Table and starts cancelling drains with aliens.<br>
Before I know it I'm down like 25 cards and he's got like<br>
2 cards in his lost pile and is pretty much set. I decide<br>
to start doing some Chamber invasions. Vader comes in and<br>
gets Barriered. I decide to give him Janus Greetus to keep<br>
him company. He has EPP Leia , Ben , Han , and an Elom <br>
to battle and give me trouble. Vader is at least keeping<br>
Luke as captive and probably preventing like 3 more <br>
destiny draws or combos. He battles at the AChamber and I <br>
Weapon Levitation Ben's Stick. Leia misses and we draw <br>
destiny him getting the better of the situation. He gets<br>
two and I make him revive. Vader dies and I'm really <br>
limited in my decisions because of force. I deploy another<br>
Vader and use You Are Beaten to exclude Ben. I use the <br>
Emperor's Power to get a decent draw and force him to lose<br>
Leia at least but Vader goes down again. I decide to sent<br>
Janus for a walk to help out Igar. Igar has been doing <br>
the whole draining thing joined by a Projection and a PotF. <br>
I'm taking more damage and I'm in danger mode. I gotta<br>
step up here and make the game or break the game. I deploy<br>
Lord Vader with his Lightsaber to the Audience Chamber and <br>
battle versus General Solo , Ben , Elom , and a Monk. <br>
I have to hit Ben and Lord Vader is insane adding to his <br>
weapon destiny so I rack up like a 10 total and Ben is <br>
slashed. The tricky part is that I also have to rack up<br>
8 attrition to get rid of Solo and avoid any more damage.<br>
I use Emporer's Power and come up with exactly 8 which is <br>
awesome. He tries to revive Solo during weapon segment <br>
but because the End of a battle is after all forfeiting<br>
Ben has to survive to revive ( heh- it rhymes ) he's gotta<br>
lose Solo. That's huge. So he tries to minimize the damage<br>
and throws out Harc Seff and an Elom to battle and try to<br>
suck up all the damage. I slash an Elom and he tries to <br>
forfeit all his characters there but can't. I say can't <br>
because he has this one little B'omarr Monk who has survived<br>
for quite some time but doesn't participate in offensive <br>
battles so he takes 3 damage , stacks a force , and now<br>
has to choose between staying inside versus Vader with <br>
Lightsaber or go outside to Tempest 1 , Igar , and Janus<br>
with the possibility of 2 destiny plus I could burn the<br>
Emperor's Power so he's looking at a lot of damage either <br>
way. He decides to stay in the AChamber. On my turn I drop<br>
Tarkin , 4-LOM , and beatdown on the Monk for 16 after the <br>
Monk , he also has to stack a card and I've jumped right<br>
back into the game. His turn he starts drawing while I start<br>
draining and playing catch up. He puts down Mos Eisley and I<br>
move my characters around to my best and leave super ginzu<br>
inside. Eventually Ben Kenobi and Orrimarko are deployed at<br>
Mos Eisley so the end game is near. We keep positioning <br>
ourselves around and I put Vader's Shuttle up at Rendili<br>
to fulfill the Battle Order I tracked so hard to deploy <br>
-- gotta love the retrieval from Op Killer. I haven't seen<br>
a ship all game until he deploys Lando in Millenium Falcon<br>
in front of Vader's Shuttle. After deploying Lando he has<br>
exactly one force left and draws it ( fearing Emperor's P <br>
to draw a 5). It was probably the longest I've ever waited<br>
for someone to decide to draw a card or not at a critical<br>
time ;) I'm putting lots of pressure on him with my drains<br>
and drop down First Strike , battle twice , retrieve 2 while<br>
he loses 2 and I get rid of Lando in Falcon. Battle Order <br>
is fulfilled and Igar packs up and moves away from Mos<br>
Eisley. If Han isn't deployed all he can do is battle me,<br>
if he deploys Han then I have an extra drain of 2 in the<br>
Audience Chamber. He was in trouble either way. So I pull<br>
up a win by 7 or 8. Record : 2 ( +8 ) <br>
<br>
Highs : Coming back after a huge deficit. Punishing him and<br>
basically winning the game off one mistake. <br>
Lows : Watching like half my deck go to my Lost Pile in<br>
       Record time. <br>
<br>
Game 2 : &quot; X-Y-Z Supafly&quot; vs. Walter Cowart's ROps <br>
<br>
This game goes bad for a deck I've spent soo many cardslots<br>
to mess over. Basically a 3rd turn Search and Destroy <br>
eats me for like 20 force while I struggle to find my <br>
last system I need to flip ( Systems get in active pile<br>
quickly when you activate a ton ). Not much to this game.<br>
Monnok helps keep the game from major surprises. Just about<br>
everything just twisted a little bit to mess me over. I <br>
think this game was over in like 15 minutes. <br>
Record : 2 ( -13 ) <br>
<br>
Highs : limiting the loss to 21. <br>
Lows : Just about everything. <br>
<br>
Game 3 : &quot; Burn Him Before Me&quot; vs. a scrub<br>
<br>
It was ugly. I deploy Vader and he deploys EPP Luke to an<br>
X-Wing in space. He takes like 3 damage from Your Destiny<br>
the whole game through. He uses lots and lots of X-Wings<br>
but its just over after it starts. Win by 25-26. <br>
Record : 4 ( +12 ) <br>
<br>
Highs : Deciding when to lose the Op Killer to retrieve<br>
a card. <br>
Lows : Not working hard versus player.<br>
<br>
Game 4 : &quot; X-Y-Z Supafly&quot; vs. Lee's Bring Him Before Me<br>
<br>
Lee seems a little unhappy about the pairing and lets<br>
the room know. We both know each other decks but I keep<br>
switching my Hidden Base on him so that gives me a bit<br>
of an edge. Vader hits Cloud City Docking Bay so I give<br>
him Farmboy Luke. Mara and Saber deploy to take his place<br>
while Supafly in ship and Jek on Spiral hang at Bespin<br>
system. I cancel his drain with It's a Hit and start <br>
doing a little bit of damage. He deploys like the Avenger<br>
and Devastator with Evax aboard and Lateral Damages <br>
Spiral. I have a Laser Cannon on Wedge's ship and when he<br>
battles I play Power Pivot to make the Evax ship Power=0 <br>
but he Senses and loses 3 force total for it. I take a bit<br>
of damage and draw a 0 to make things worse. I stack a card.<br>
I kick out another system or two and flip then move Wedge<br>
and ship to Kessel while Keir Santage goes to Kiffex. <br>
He drops Chimaera which I barrier and he puts Tarkin on it.<br>
On my turn I Tunnel Vision for Falcon and drop Cpt. Han<br>
and Falcon. I battle and come up big by drawing a 10 battle<br>
destiny which gets rid of Tarkin , Chimaera , wins the <br>
battle , and I play Legendary Starfighter on the Falcon<br>
so he starts losing 2 force everymove phase which is big.<br>
He finally probes the correct system but I It Could Be <br>
Worse the damage so I'm up and put Landing Claw on the Falcon<br>
to make it safe as possible. He cancels the Claw with Godherd<br>
but its too late. Win by 21. Record : 6 (+33)<br>
<br>
Highs : Drawing a 10 destiny to knock out Chimeara for Legend<br>
and getting a solid win.<br>
Lows : He had 2 cards stacked and with a freaky win of a <br>
battle he could've won the game at any time. <br>
<br>
Game 5 : &quot; Burn Him Before Me &quot; v. Walter Cowart's Throne Room<br>
<br>
So its Throne Room start versus Throne Room start. I start <br>
Op Enforcement along with the normal two to keep SAC down.<br>
Side note here : I was actually supposed to play Light Side <br>
again but since I'd already played Walter with the Light Side<br>
I figured that they know that I can't play him with the same <br>
side again so I walk over and use my Dark Side. This causes <br>
me to play my Darkside this game and the next which is probably<br>
in my advantage to do. First turn I deploy Emperor to CC:DBay<br>
and go. He deploys Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker from Reserve , <br>
a Nudj , battles , and plays Smoke Screen to have a 12 power<br>
while I only have like a 5. Its 7 or just Emperor.<br>
I toss Emperor aside like its no big deal and it isn't. <br>
So I get out Rendili and generate and stuff and draw trying to<br>
figure a way around Jedi Luke. He deploys Lower Corridor and<br>
moves Jedi Knight Luke into there and deploys another Nudj to<br>
the swamp but forgets to move it ( huge ). I have Fett in Slave<br>
1 up at Rendili and Battle Order on the table so he's paying for<br>
his drains. The downside is he deploys Obi-Wan Kenobi with Saber<br>
to the Corridor too so he is paying 3 to drain for 3. Once <br>
again I'm looking at a +15 card lost pile very quickly and have<br>
to pull another big comeback to win it. He forgets to move a <br>
Nudj over to the Farm again so I decide to make him pay. I drop<br>
Tempest 1 and Igar ( I only play one of each but T1 came out <br>
every single game and the combo popped twice ) so I have <br>
fulfilled Battle Order for the time being. He gets to Drain<br>
me for 3 twice and moves over a Nudj and I choose not to pay<br>
to drain for 1 until I get Battle Order up for free. I manage<br>
to get Evazan and Blizzard 2 down to the Swamp and Janus moves<br>
into the Throne Room (his). So now I'm paying nothing to drain<br>
and I hit him for 6 drain while he pays 3 to drain for 3. On<br>
his turn he deploys Supafly to his Homeone : War Room and <br>
deploys Home One to Rendili for like 7 Force...Barrier. Heh.<br>
On my turn I deploy Lateral Damage on Rendezvous Point , deploy<br>
Mist Hunter , and Dengar in Ship. Battle I draw good and after<br>
all it said and done he loses Home One , Wedge , 13 to battle<br>
damage , and stacks a card. That was huge. He drops Melas and<br>
Boussh to the Throne Room but its already too late. He does more<br>
damage here and there but not enough. Win by 7. <br>
Record : 8 (+40)<br>
<br>
Highs : Getting huge confidence boosts in this deck , twice<br>
spotting players rated over 1900 and 2000 about 20 force and <br>
coming back to win the game. Keeping from getting beat twice by<br>
the same person. <br>
<br>
Lows : I seem to keep being the person on the edge playing <br>
someone with one less win so I need higher differential to get <br>
into to the Final.<br>
<br>
Game 6 : &quot; Burn Him Before Me&quot; vs. Will Raiman's Good Deck<br>
<br>
I think his name was Will Raiman , nice guy , reminded me of a<br>
mini-Steven Turner :) Well I let them know that I should be <br>
playing light. One of the weirdest feelings is when you both<br>
pull your Light decks to play. They say we should've looked<br>
at the cards but yada , yada , yada things stay the same so<br>
I get to play my Darkside 4 times and thats an edge for me.<br>
So this can be an epic game that could be won at any time <br>
because both DS2 Objectives are being played and every battle<br>
counts. I get my usual generation and deploy Fett to Rendili<br>
to fulfill an early Battle Order. He starts pulling Scouts <br>
left and right with Madine and stuff. I bring down Lord Vader<br>
with stick and start smacking around scouts. I You Are Beaten<br>
any particularly nasty ones and we tie on power a ton of times<br>
which is weird and keeps us from stacking cards. I'm burning<br>
Emperor's Power a bit so that keeps me a little be behind. <br>
I manage to spread out a bit and hit him once with Your <br>
Destiny because Luke forget to move from the Hut for a turn.<br>
He's got scout crazyness and we keep manuevering around each<br>
other but I've got Battle Order so his major activation is<br>
put to use for drains. He plays Insertion Planning a few times<br>
which is pretty cool. I never really manage to beat him down<br>
because he's got a ton of scouts and plays with the most<br>
under-rated card from Endor , Corporal Delevar. So I'm just<br>
tossing little guys aside and have Tarkin cancel a destiny here<br>
and there. He's got out like 5 sites so I can keep Vader away<br>
from Luke and Force loss. He never ever comes to space so Fett<br>
just drains away for 1 a turn. We start transitting all over<br>
the place and Luke finally catches up to Vader ( side note :<br>
he used like Hidden Trail or Great forest thing where Scouts<br>
can move from any location to or from there and could've<br>
caught Vader like 3 turns quicker) little mistake. Vader , <br>
Blizzard 2 , and Tarkin move to Cloud City while a whole ton <br>
of scouts move to Death Star 2 for a mortgage and come to say<br>
hello to the Emperor. Another side note : he could've kept<br>
a destiny draw at the Docking Bay and made it so the Emperor<br>
couldn't move away and we would've had some interesting<br>
battles. I stacked maybe a card or 2 and the same was with him.<br>
In the end though I've got him pretty solid. I win by 13-16 ?<br>
Record : 10 ( +50-something )<br>
<br>
Highs : winning<br>
Lows : Not winning by enough to reach the finals.<br>
<br>
Overall it was a great tournament that ran so smoothly it didn't<br>
feel like I played 6 games. Tournament was over at like 5-6 ,<br>
no bad rulings for me , and I came in 5th so I picked up the <br>
last custom trophy made by Gregg Keefer. I turn in my usual<br>
5-1 performance at a major event and land in Top 8 in Dagobah <br>
for the 4th year in a row. <br>
<br>
I watch the Final confrontation which was pretty much a bore and<br>
actually made me pretty frustrated. Ben Matthews' decks sucked<br>
and Charlie Herren made a bunch of silly mistakes one was pretty<br>
major. After a 29 win with his Light Side its pretty obvious that<br>
Charlie will win especially after Ben has like 10 systems on the<br>
table and a bunch of X-Wings. Nothing really special about the<br>
games. <br>
<br>
Tournament Observations : Squadron Assignments was in probably<br>
60-80% of all the decks I saw , that was a bit of a shock. <br>
Ralltiir Ops probably consisted of 25-30 of the 64 players <br>
Dark Sides decks. Lord Vader is insanely strong with a <br>
lightsaber , even if your paying +10 for him. My darkside can <br>
spot a lead and then make it really interesting at the end. <br>
Pairings make all the difference if you lose. My rating will <br>
go up like +50 points so I just cranked up my highest rating <br>
ever a few notches and should be in the 1980s range. <br>
<br>
After Tournament : Lots of fun stuff. Most of my friends stayed<br>
the night after the tournament so we went out to eat , played <br>
cards , and played some N64. After spending one night in a<br>
good hotel with a bad shower and one night in a bad hotel<br>
with a good shower I truly believe a good shower can overcome<br>
any bad hotel. <br>
<br>
Funniest happening of weekend : Before going to Bennigan's for<br>
dinner we're all outside and Lee takes out a cigar and lights<br>
it , those who don't know him look a little shocked , then Josh<br>
Hoade says out loud &quot; WHAT THE HELL, or **** , ARE YOU DOING?&quot;.<br>
Lee gets scared and spazes out dropping his lighter and cigar ,<br>
it was pretty funny. <br>
<br>
Props : <br>
-to Neal Razi and Joshua Hoade for making me laugh<br>
-to Lee's Suicide Knob which was really fun to spin when it<br>
was boring driving. <br>
-to the funny stories in Swank , which were better then the<br>
pictures. <br>
-to Jason Burrows , for being cool.<br>
<br>
Slops : <br>
-to any gibronies who couldn't beat the players higher then<br>
me ;)<br>
-to Swank for showing like skanks.<br>

&quot;He must've been hiding cards in his @#$%-tits &quot; <br>

&quot;You mean you can use 2 force to get a card with Ralltiir Ops?&quot; <br>
( Neal in sarcasm )<br>
<br>
&quot;How many times have you started just S-Foils in an X-Wing deck,<br>
how many times have you played no SAC protection in an X-Wing<br>
deck , how many times would you start the signal over 3 effects<br>
over The Signal in an X-Wing deck ?&quot;<br>
