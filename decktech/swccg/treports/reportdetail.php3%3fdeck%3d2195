I&#146;m trying to figure out what to play for both sides for about 2 weeks before the tourney. I finally settle on Red Squadron, Report In! for Light (variation of a deck design my Statman) and a copy of Dark Squadron FINAL for Dark. (http://www.decktech.net/swccg/decks/dark/darkdetail.php3?deck=14939) Thanks to Ryan Austin for a cool deck idea. I did modify it just a bit; took out one Short-range Fighters and added an EPP Vader. Did this for 2 reasons: (1) I didn&#146;t have a 2nd Short-range Fighters, and (2) LordMaxx was gonna mail me one to borrow for the tourney but I didnt get it it in time. (Guess ~somebody~ missed the memo with my change of address on it.) Also renamed it to ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US. LordMaxx had e-mailed me the Flash movie the day before and I couldnt get the song or the phrase out of my head. Almost renamed the Light deck to be the same, but didnt. I test the decks over and over against a number of decktypes. They do pretty well against most of them. I also printed a decklist for each side and memorized the cards in the deck. This helped out a great deal. <br>
<br>
Morning of the tourney arrives and I get an early start at 8am. Its about 1 hour+ to get there from where I live and I want to be sure I can get a place to park. The drive there is slow cause on HWY 50 North, there is a frikin tractor on the road. Everytime there is an opportunity to pass, a car is coming from the other direction. Made for slow going on the way up. Fortunately, I had a home-made Metallica CD that was cranked to the max. Finally get there, fill out a command card and turn in my deck lists. Play a few games of JediKnights with some seriously underpowered and watered-down decks. Eddie Brown gets there and I let him borrow and EPP Leia. I was gonna borrow a Dreaded Imperial Starfleet from him, but I don&#146;t need it. Apparently, he was on a serious lack of sleep and looked at me like I had lobsters coming out of my ears. (A Christmas Story; best X-Mas movie of all time.) Eventually he figured it out. (and wrote about it in his TR - http://www.decktech.net/swccg/treports/reportdetail.php3?deck=2185)<br>
Everybody gets there and registers and Patrick Hines goes over the standard TR rules and such. One of his biggest pet peeves: SCOUTING. This includes talking about such-and-such deck after the tourney has begun. Anybody caught scouting (talking or watching) another game will be disqualified. Period. Pack your sh!t and go home. Everybody agrees that this is best. The first pairings are called.<br>
<br>
GAME 1: Dark vs Ryan Obman - WYS<br>
I&#146;ve played Ryan before and he&#146;s not too pleased about it. I get Rumors to Endor and Ephant to the Bunker first turn. DIS on the table to cancel drains pretty quickly. Also have Arica in hand for if/when he startes draining at sites. I hold off deploying anything until he does. He deploys Kessel with Dash/Outrider CaptHan/Falcon there. Talon Karrde and Jedi Luke to Cantina. I dump a bunch of TIE Interceptors with weapons, a Dreadnaught, and Dengar in P1 to Kessel and battle him. Hes all happy cause he thinks he will get 3 destiny draws. I play Power Pivot (didn&#146;t save enough to shoot one of them) All Power To Weapons and the Lost part of Main Course and subtract 9 from his draws. He is grossly overpowered and loses a lot. I spread and drain while blocking his. Win by 23.<br>
2 (+23)<br>
<br>
Highs: <br>
winning game one<br>
kicking the dogsnot out of The Space Smuggler Combo<br>
Lows:<br>
forgetting that with Sienar I can put a lost TIE in Used<br>
<br>
So between games 1 and 2, I&#146;m talking with Matt Guinn about Tatooine and the possibilites of future deck types. Good ideas we came up with. Game 2 gets called.<br>
<br>
GAME 2: Light vs Henry ( I cant even spell or pronouce his last name) - ISB Mains<br>
I&#146;ve played Henry before on the local scene. Our games are usually close, and this one is no exception. I deploy systems and ships, he deploys dudes (ORS). He deploys Chimarea with Thrawn at my Ralliir and initiates against Elyhek Rue in matching ship with X-Wing Laser Cannon. I react with Luke in R2inR5, he cancels with TRWEU. I also react with Lt. Nytaan in matching ship. No cancel. This gives me the ability 4 I need to draw. I play Organized Attack, Power Pivot, and Out Of Nowhere. Now I have 2 draws to power and 2 draws for destiny. This kicks the crap out of him. From there, it&#146;s a cat and mouse game for battling, blocking drains and running away. He&#146;s playing rather slowly as well. Near the end, we know time is slipping away. Time gets called during his turn. I get one more turn to finish the game. I deploy what I have left in my hand to the system where we&#146;ve been building up. I&#146;ve got tons of dudes in ships and hes got the Executor with a dude or 2 on it. I initiate, and he just says, &quot;I&#146;ll ghhhk it. That&#146;s it.&quot; I&#146;m insisting on us doing every action and counting out power. He&#146;s (finally) rushing to finish the game. We count out life force without doing all the actions resulting from the battle. I have 13; he as 14. Now this REALLY pisses me off. I have Draw Their Fire on the table and I shoudve retrieved one and him lose one. This wouldve swung the Force differential in my favor. But nooooo. This punk has to finally rush the game to finish and I get a loss.<br>
2(+9)<br>
<br>
Highs: kicking the crap out of the Chimarea<br>
Lows: losing that way. <br>
<br>
Im REAL freakin pissed at this point and a bunch of other people know it. They agree with me that Henry is famous for stalling and timing out his games. I warn Henry to stay out of my way or I&#146;m gonna kick his @ss. I&#146;m usually not like this, but there is no excuse for his crappy play. Game 3 gets called. I pity the person I have to play next. <br>
<br>
GAME 3: Light vs Bo Marr - HDADTJ. Yes, his name is Bo Marr. Bo is the nickname.<br>
I&#146;ve played Bo before. Good player, nice guy. I hated that he had to be the one that suffers my wrath after the fiasco in the last game. We get our starting stuff out and wait for the timer person to yell GO. We start. Bo gets a docking bay and deploys with vis IAO. He then notices that he had deployed Visage on the Med Chamber instead of the Holotheater. I tell him that under any other circumstances in any other tourney, I would let him put it in the right place and continue. But this is STATES, I&#146;m pissed and Im gonna be a hard@ss. We call the TD over and he rules that Visage is lost. Things go down for Bo from there. I drain and block his drains. He redeploys Visage and I lose to it for a few turns. I get Boussh to the Holotheater and cancel it. Im ready to drain there for more next turn. He deploys Flagship Executor to Dash/Outrider and initates battle. I win, but he loses Executor as well as the sites. Even though he lost, you gotta admire the testicular fortitude it took to do a suicide run with Executor. Most impressive. He gets ZiMH out with 4LOM w/ Gun on there at a unprotected system. I deploy a dude with matching ship and a laser. I initiate. He thinks Im nuts. I use 3 to make X=3 and shoot it down and lost thus ending the battle. I continue to drain and and end up winning by 10. <br>
4(+19)<br>
<br>
Highs: shooting down ZiMH while he thinks he has the upper hand<br>
Lows: None. Played flawlessly.<br>
<br>
LUNCH BREAK. I head across the street in this Mayberry-esque town to the local video store that sells pizza, popcorn and soda. The pizza aint that great, but food is food. Im still ticked about Henry and I see him exiting the shop. He apologizes a lot and says that he will put an apology in his TR that he will write. I tell him (with very angry overtones) that an apology wont make me State champion. I go in the store and leave him there looking stunned. Get some crappy pizza with Bo and some others. Bo and I laugh about the Visage thing, but I can see that he is still a bit peeved by it. Oh well. Head back to the tourney. I figure that if I win out, I might be able to make a top 5 finish.<br>
<br>
GAME 4: Dark vs Jason Barnes - TIGIH Scouts, Surprise! <br>
From starting stuff, I knew I had no chance. He would control 3 Endor sites and cancel Rumors. He gets Beezer out with Madine and some Baragwins. (What the…?) Luke and company to the DB. I put U-3PO to block. One Restraining Bolt and Caller later, he now controls my droid. Crap. He loses devices to drains and gets them back with the Baragwins. All high destiny devices too. I start getting past some of the devices and inflict some real damage. Then he plays Away Put Your Weapons and all of the devices on the table to in to Used. Crap. He then Surprise Assaults my 5 TIEs at Sullust and I lose 15. An On The Edge with a tracked 6 gets it back. He tracks it back to his hand and does it again. Game over. Lose by 15.<br>
4(+4)<br>
<br>
Highs: None for me. Pretty cool to see my U3PO Bolted and tons of devices being used in a deck. But, even though I lost, this was a fun game. Jason is a good guy and a great sportsman. <br>
Lows: Having to play against an Endor deck. Crap.<br>
<br>
So now I know that I have to win out just to break into top 10. Guess it just depends on who and what I play against. <br>
<br>
GAME 5: Light vs Ed (didn&#146;t catch is last name) MYOS Abyssians<br>
I didn&#146;t quite know what kind of deck this fully was until he tried to deploy a JP site from Reserve and didn&#146;t find one. Verfied the deck and saw ZERO space. Good for me. I got out systems quickly (helps to have 3 in opening hand) and flipped. He got some dudes out to a 3rd site and flipped. Boussh blocked one and  I cancelled the other 2. Knowing I was gonna win and tiring of the non-action, I broke her cover and deployed dudes. Initiated with I&#146;ve Got A Bad Feeling About This and doubled the damage. Played more cat and mouse from there until he captured 2 of the dudes (Leia and Wedge) and delivered them to the Dungeon. Now it was getting serious. He wasn&#146;t gonna play around. Fine with me. Found my It Could Be Worse and used it every one of his turns. Only lost 1 to a drain each time from my hand. Drained him for 8 each turn. Won shortly after that by 20<br>
6 (+24)<br>
<br>
Highs: Getting a big win when I needed it most. <br>
During his game, Jason Hairson stands up and yells STAR DESTROYER! which drew cheers from the other players.<br>
Lows: Not winning by more. <br>
<br>
GAME 6: Dark vs Mike Merletto - Agents Fake Out; Really Mains<br>
I&#146;m played against Mike and this deck before. He sees my starting stuff and tells me, Congrats, you just won the game. Im thinking that this must be the same deck that he used before. Jokingly, I offer him an EPP Fett FOIL to throw the game by 35. He says sure and we laugh about it. Sitting on one side of us is Eddie Brown and on the other side is Rob Werbicki; 2 of Mike&#146;s friends. I know all 3. When you put the 3 of them together, they are freakin hilarious. I think I hurt my pancreas I laughed so hard. (C0CKB0MB! See Eddie&#146;s TR for details…..)<br>
Game went pretty fast. I blocked drains with Dark Waters and Arica. He came to space with Spiral, EPP Han and EPP Leia. I deployed 7 TIE Ints initiated and played APTW. Crush. He goes on the run and I can&#146;t follow. We drain back and forth until I get a Dreadnaught out to take some TIEs with me to where his is. Battle, Crush, Retrieve, Move. Kept going until I won by 25. Rob next to us was repeating over and over that his deck sucked. <br>
8 (+49)<br>
<br>
So with that win, I end up 9th out of 37.<br>
<br>
Props: <br>
Patrick running a smooth tourney even though I annoyed the crap out of him with rulings.<br>
