<br>
we get to the store and there was only like 18 players which is a low number but there were a few other players with respectable rankings<br>
<br>
Game One, LS vs a new kid's Corulag ops (1500)<br>
<br>
he starts corulag ops and strategic reserves.  I get out some random guys in echo base and flip, with melas and wedge both flying up to the tantive waiting at hoth.  He gets out the one site that lets him drain one if he had a non-unique imperial leader, along with expand the empire so his drains are all plus one.  he controls two sites so he's draining for 6 a turn, while i control both yavin 4 and hoth so i'm draining for 6 too, but i get an projection on one of his sites and it could be worse shows its face every once in a while so i'm ahead in the race, he deploys vader and like 4 troopers to hoth but don't really move them toward echo base.  i decide to prevent him from flipping so i drop random guys like epp luke, obi, tawss, incom engineer, h'nmenth, lock, etc to one of his sites and beat him off, although i am worried that he'll elis/beatdown my guys, but he deploys lobel to my site so i feel much better, i battle him some more on corulag but always move his lobel away with obi-wan so he doesn't die :-)  i'm figrin'ing to retrive one every turn and eventually my drains were too much, win by 28.  2+28<br>
<br>
Game Two, DS vs Graham Neal's Yops (1888)<br>
<br>
I'm laughing to myself when i see this match up but he's not too pleased, especially since i know every single card in his deck.  he starts bothan ops and yarna, while i pull Decree, i get a few twix sites and put them out.  his first turn he doesn't deploy any y-wings, i only assume he was afarid of zuckuss or something, he does have 8 organized attacks in the deck... second turn i flip and draw for some ships.  his turn 7 y-wings fly up to bothawui, but his organized attack gets grabbed.  my turn out comes zuckuss in mh, 4-lom, and bubble boy, battle and two destinies later he has only a few ships left at bothuwai.  eventually he gets out ops at some sites and flip, but i drop a dreadnaught with pilot at kashyyyk and he has no drains due to flipped objective + decree.  he knows there really isn't a way he can win this game, so in a pretty funny scene, all the ops and y-wings all fly up to bothawui from his 8 sites, pretty funny to picture all the operatives getting on y-wings and abandoning their planet if it was acted out or something.  well i drop more ships and battle him some more and he doesn't even get any retrival in and eventually i drain him out 'cos now his objective is flipped back and i can drain freely, win by 28.  4+56<br>
<br>
Game Three, LS vs Mike Raveling's quarren inserts (1907)<br>
<br>
he starts carbon chamber testing and i give him &quot;lock&quot; navander.  he scanning crews me first turn and gets rid of wedge.  i throw out bothan spy and kfc at echo base first turn to lessen any inserts that are coming.  his turn he scans me some more and gets rid of my rebels, and drops a quarren and a skrilling, each at a drain two site, and feltpern at the audience chamber, and inserts me.  my turn the insert pops for like 5 damage.  well, my turn out comes tantive at hoth, 2 red squad x-wings at yavin and wedge on the tantive.  i draw up still looking for characters, he's draining me for like 4 a turn but he's only activating like 7 so i'm drawing like mad for a battle order too but i can't go over 12 cards... he starts getting skrillings/quarrens spreading around on hoth and after a couple turns cancels ebo, i was helpless to stop it even though i shocked him once because both battle plan and my grabber are lost from the top, so i'm pretty much screwed.  he picks up leia and pulls her over to the CC site that lets him drain +2 or something, but luckiely he couldn't get leia with a screw and i drop here and kill off the guy he had, so for a couple of turns i had a drain of 4 going, but then he ornaments and retrives 7 and vader comes down and kills some people, lose by 15.  4+41<br>
<br>
Game Four, DS vs Andy Newton's mains and toys (1825)<br>
<br>
andy starts with obi's hut + toshi station, i figure there is a good chance he's playing sac so i grab oppressive.  i draw the obligatory 2 twix sites in my opening hand and throw those out for some nice generation.  i start getting chicken walkers and pilots to the desert, which is the only site at raltiir.  he doesn't get anyone out at toshi station, but soon he has epp luke sitting n the cantina draining.  i'm trying to draw out some more mains before i flip to make it harder for him to flip it back... a turn later epp han joins luke, i decide this is a good time and i get jungle from reserve and spaceport docking bay from hand and throw those out, along with an imp at each site, rops flip and i drop epp vader at cantina, battle luke+han, i hit han he hits vader i draw a 0 which is a 3 and he draws something good so i have to lose vader and 4 while he loses both guys, move phase my walkers at desert move over and pick up the imps at jungle and docking bay.  his turn he draws looking for more characters, my turn out comes avenger + pilot at coruscant, zuckuss, dreadnaught + pilot at kashyyyk and i'm putting the pressure on, plus i get out IAO.  he drops boussh for 10 force on one of my sites and doesn't really have anything else to do.  i drain and he's running low on force so he can't mount a comeback and i drain him out. win by something close to 20.<br>
<br>
Game Five, LS vs Cameron's Walker garrison (1600?)<br>
<br>
he starts hoth and wants to pull out 3rd marker but can't due to the shields so he starts decree instead.  i drop all my sites first turn and deploys bothan spy and wedge to echo base.  he doesn't do much besides activate force/draw/save force for the first few turns so i get ebo out with tantive + wedge at yavin 4 and a couple red squad x-wings at hoth. i wasn't afarid of any space he had 'cos i had the superfalcon in hand along with leg. starfighter so anything he throws out will get killed the next turn.  he finally saves enough force to deploy vader/tempest one/tarkin to his 6th marker and moves them over.  I drain for 7 the next turn and he decides it is a good time to throw down djas puhr with vader and moves tempest one/tarkin over to north ridge to satisfy decree.  i drop Obi+Luke+twass+kfc with tempest one and drop a scrub at the adjecent site so he couldn't satisfy decree next turn, and i dropped mech. failure at the docking bay targeting the walker.  i battle i draw a 3 he draws a 4 so kfc couldn't do any work but he has to lose like 15 cards, plus i retrive one.  his turn iggy comes down with djas and vader moves over with the crippled walker and they both move to mpg.  my turn drain for 7, drop a scrub at 4th marker so he can't satisfy decree next turn, move the scrub at the mpg over to docking bay, and move obi+luke+tawss over with vader.  his turn he moves vader/walker over to the docking bay and misses the draw for mech. failure.  i play a scrub at mpg and move the scrub at mpg over to echo corridor and move obi+luke+tawss over with vader/walker, so he's basically never gonna occupy imp. decree.  he gets rid of mech. failure and we battle a couple of times with no decided winner but my drain in space is too much for him to handle, win by 30.<br>
<br>
Game Six, DS vs Mike Raveling's Mains and toys (1907)<br>
<br>
i start iao and he starts obi's hut and jabba's palace, nothing of interest happens in the first few turns except i drop some twix sites, gets a chicken walker at desert and draws for some stuff.  i want to wait until i can get a walker at everysite before i flip, but i don't want to get over 12 cards so i do random things like play battle order and CHYBC right away and play avenger + pilot to raltiir.  well he decides to drop tantive + pilot, luke and artoo in red 5 at my system and just kills my pilot, well my turn out comes zuckuss + 4 lom and a dread and i battle and he loses tantive and like something from hand.  his turn he deploys ben, stick, and proficency at the hut and wedge at Jabba's palace, he moves obi to JP and runs luke to kashyyyk.  i don't want to lose 3 force a turn so i recycle a shocking and activate so that i have 3 force left in my reserve deck, I know the middle card is a 5 and the bottom card is a 3 but i don't know what the top card is, oh well, i drop epp vader with ben and wedge and start a battle, i swing at obi and draw devastator and shocking, but Oppressive makes the devastator a 2 so ben is hit, and my destiny = 3, while he smokescreens so we both have to lose everything but luckily he didn't hit vader so no overflow for me.  my turn some pilot gets on zuckuss, i flip with walkers and atst pilots at every site, and move zuckuss back with luke and dread over to kashyyyk with avenger.  he drops lando in falcon and battles me but all i have to lose is the pilot and he loses the falcon, and he runs luke back over to kashyyyk.  my turn bubble boy and vesden comes out to raltiir and zuckuss goes back to kashyyyk, all the while i'm draining for 3 on the ground.  he alters my bad feeling but it goes back to my used, then he drops tk422 at spaceport docking bay and moves luke back to raltiir.  well my turn i drop devastator to coruscant and battle luke in red 5, with rops fliped i easily kill luke while bubble boy stays, plus i twilekd and grabbed bad feeling have i again and threw it out.  his turn he threw down boussh for 10 force and that was it.  so i'm draining for 4 a turn and just sit on that waiting for him to do something but there really wasn't anything he could do, eventually he dropped some scrubs at desert, and boshek at jungle break leias cover and battle, i react with tempest scout 6 and clear out the site with attrition of 9, while all i have to lose is tempest scout 6, and my turn sandwhirl gets rid of all of his guys at desert and i drain him out.  win by 13.<br>
<br>
I go 5-1 with pretty high differential so i win the tournament over graham who's only loss was to me with his yops deck :-)  I grab some pretty bad CC packs and open nothing good.  it was overall a pretty good tournament and i played 4 people with 1800+ ratings so it was pretty cool, i got to look at some death star two cards that Mike Raveling got from a pre-release. The bespin regionals is coming in in a few weeks and i'm definitly looking forward to that.<br>
