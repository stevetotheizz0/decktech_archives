Still alot of bad grammar and stuff in this one but this one is at least readable.<br>
<br>
<br>
                 All right. Where to begin? It all started about a month<br>
                 ago, I saw the posting for a CT tourney so for the past<br>
                 two to three weeks I had been bugging my buddy<br>
                 and candidate for coolest man alive, mike gemme to<br>
                 drive down there. Road trips are fun so he is like ok i<br>
                 am in and since he was in so was steebo...steebo<br>
                 and deck, deck and steebo. Kinda like batman and<br>
                 robin, no more like Spiderman and harry<br>
                 osborne(more on this later). <br>
<br>
                 So Friday the 13th rolls around and I take the train to<br>
                 hayes&#146; house and we meet up with pauly m and do<br>
                 some playtesting. I playtest a solid wys and decide<br>
                 to play it rather than my crusty dagobah. I play<br>
                 huntdown racing for dark cuz i am a retard...friday is<br>
                 kinda boring but whatever it was also sorta cool.<br>
                 Well we drive to gemme&#146;s house and just as we get<br>
                 there mike&#146;s sister and her hot friend<br>
                 mckensie(mike&#146;s sis is also hot for those of you who<br>
                 have been living in a cave) walk out.  Anyway they are leaving<br>
                 and because of hayes&#146; horrible parking they come<br>
                 over and talk to us for 2 seconds and this is<br>
                 great...mckensie is like &quot;good luck tomorrow&quot; and i<br>
                 just wink...ds testing--sometimes you don&#146;t need to<br>
                 say anything. <br>
<br>
                 Well I get inside his house and take a dump in his<br>
                 bathroom which is connected to his sis&#146;s room with<br>
                 no lock so I am paranoid even though she isn&#146;t even<br>
                 home but whatever. I play mike a few times and he<br>
                 eats all my guys with his sick rancourt deck that he<br>
                 built because he saw this little kid eat like qui gonn<br>
                 jedi luke and obi at a local the week before...I am<br>
                 like play this deck tomorrow because it is hot. Very<br>
                 good against anything that goes to tatooine and<br>
                 good against space too because of court game<br>
                 text...weakness could be qmc though. <br>
                 Well mrs. gemme walks in and i am stunned by her<br>
                 beauty, she is blond and hot...not unlike mrs. baroni<br>
                 and i am shocked that i haven&#146;t heard of her beauty<br>
                 and great breasts...what the hell steebo! <br>
<br>
                 So the plan at this point was to drive to andy klema&#146;s<br>
                 house that night and crash with him in ct so we<br>
                 wouldn&#146;t have to drive to ct in the morning.  So we<br>
                 leave around 11 and have a cool time in the<br>
                 car...hayes constantly pressures gemme to go<br>
                 faster but gemme is chill and just takes it easy. we<br>
                 go in the carpool lane, we drive through the ghetto at<br>
                 70 mph. We try to mack girls but it is too late and<br>
                 we can&#146;t get out of the carpool lane anyway. We get<br>
                 to klema&#146;s house and end of story. <br>
                 we play more games and i forget exactly but i win<br>
                 about 2/3 of my games. me and gemme decide to<br>
                 go to bed around 3 and we get put in his den which<br>
                 might double as his meat locker but whatever....I go<br>
                 get blankets for me and gemme and when i get back<br>
                 Gemme is like, &quot;did you get it?&quot; as he waits on his<br>
                 bed. I just burst out laughing because it is a like a<br>
                 condom commercial and i honestly laugh for like<br>
                 45 minutes. We try to sleep but it is way to cold so<br>
                 around 7 Gemme and me get up but are still in bed<br>
                 and Gemme is like, &#146;&quot;wanna play a game&quot; I am like<br>
                 ok he is &quot;like lets go&quot;  He takes off blanket and has<br>
                 decks in hand It was hilarious...you kinda had to be<br>
                 there. but it was damn good. <br>
<br>
                 After that we just chill to it&#146;s time to go, we see this<br>
                 teched out picture of Andy when he is three years old<br>
                 but yet still has his beard so it is all good. We leave<br>
                 kinda late and we hit traffic but we make it ontime<br>
                 and I say we are all going to play ourselves and this<br>
                 turns out to be prophetic.  Bah i am getting<br>
                 bored...--the games <br>
<br>
                 I am running solid wys w/o dont do that again<br>
                 because I am dumb. And huntdown jizz for dark. <br>
<br>
                 game 1--my dark, gemme&#146;s wys solids. <br>
                 Well it cool that we finally get to play each other… but sucks one<br>
                 of us will have to lose the first game...going into this I<br>
                 feel kinda uneasy and think he will beat me because<br>
                 he runs 3 a step backs and can play them from lost<br>
                 pile. So I think about starting someting else and<br>
                 not watto&#146;s box but I say phuck it and lets go for the<br>
                 gold(mistake #1). We it starts out relatively normal, I<br>
                 invade the cantina and he takes space...he draws<br>
                 very good for his race and I draw good but then draw<br>
                 a 1 which sucks. The race is mad close and we are<br>
                 trading drains, but here is the situation: If I win the<br>
                 race I win the game. If he wins the race, the game<br>
                 will be darn close. Well anyway he wins the race<br>
                 despite some pretty teched out moves by me. I flip<br>
                 him back though by getting maul in space, he needs<br>
                 to find melas asap...he does after about 3 turns of<br>
                 doing nothing but drawing. That is pretty much game<br>
                 because  he has space and every time a try to duel luke he cancels it.<br>
                 Very good game and i made close to no mistakes,<br>
                 but huntdown podracing doesn&#146;t fare to well when it<br>
                 loses the race. Full loss by 14 <br>
<br>
                 Highs: great game...mike is the man. <br>
                 Lows: nada. <br>
                 Other: best feeling loss I have ever had. <br>
<br>
                 so Hayes beats mr. @#$% himself shaun macarthy<br>
                 by a bunch. Klema wins, steebo wins...bunch of<br>
                 scrubs win(conn has a lot of really poor players, i<br>
                 mean just there scrubs vs. our scrubs, our scrubs<br>
                 will win). <br>
<br>
                 game 2 i want revenge and get matched up against<br>
                 some kid&#146;s sycfa flip. <br>
                 The kid knows the game well and blows alderan, but<br>
                 i have the following out, mad ships at tatooine, i&#146;ll<br>
                 take the leader, han at the cantina, luke at the<br>
                 middle docking bay with saber, and melas at the<br>
                 other docking bay and run luke run in hand...damn that is good. drain 8 a<br>
                 turn...game over in like 10 minutes. <br>
                 Full win by 36. <br>
<br>
                 Highs: winning <br>
                 lows: does this prove anything? no. <br>
                 other: I on the edge&#146;d my luke to kill him so I could<br>
                 retrieve more... <br>
<br>
                 hayes won again, beating andy, gemme beat a kid.<br>
                 steebo beat somebody who i guess was supposed<br>
                 to be pretty good. <br>
<br>
                 So 3rd game i get to play Brian Holingsworth (sp?) klema<br>
                 tells me he&#146;s good. <br>
<br>
                 Well he is playing hayes&#146; pile with docking bays...I just<br>
                 drop my guys to the race arena, so when i cause the<br>
                 22 force swing, i all of a sudden have the only battle<br>
                 ground on the table with vader, palp, maul and iggy...<br>
                 he tries to fight me a few times with twass khaa..wtf?<br>
                 I just dominate, he cant retrieve because of chybc...i<br>
                 only activate 3 a turn but yet i dominate...Oh well.<br>
                 Win by something like 36 or 38? <br>
                 Highs: domination. <br>
                 Lows: bah <br>
                 Other: His deck (ls) had beaten a kid by 42<br>
                 prior...hehe funny. <br>
<br>
                 So gemme lost, steebo lost, klema won, brentson<br>
                 won, hayes won. <br>
<br>
                 In between games we go to mickey dees and i get a<br>
                 big mac and it has a monoploy sticker on it...one of<br>
                 the green ones. I figure i will put it on my nipple. I do<br>
                 it and tell gemme he is like, yeah, tat is<br>
                 funny...not! thinking how it is lame that i didn&#146;t<br>
                 actually do it. whatever. We get back and i get<br>
                 paired up against steve valee&#146;s hoth deck steebo<br>
                 style. <br>
<br>
<br>
                 Right off the bat i think i am @#$%ed because i don&#146;t<br>
                 play don&#146;t do that again and without it it is a bad<br>
                 matchup for me...well the game starts out alright<br>
                 despite his mad undercover spies, i manage to get<br>
                 out some drains and he drops down like 3 star<br>
                 destroyers at tatooine and lateral damage, i barrier<br>
                 but i am still @#$%ed at the system...about this<br>
                 time, hayes ask me to take the sticker off my nipple<br>
                 because he needs it. I do it while i am deploying jedi<br>
                 luke and hand it to him....next thing i know,<br>
                 everybody in the store, except my opponent, is<br>
                 laughing like mad men...ok end of story. <br>
                 Well i battle his walkers with jedi luke and @#$%<br>
                 and am close to killing him with drains on hoth but<br>
                 then i make the mistake of a lifetime and leave my<br>
                 guys at the 5th marker, both han and luke, (my two<br>
                 edge guys). So he ice storms and i say control from<br>
                 lost pile to cancel it, he says ok but it still makes<br>
                 &#146;em missing, i say no, we call over<br>
                 somebody(mularky?) and sides with him...i look for<br>
                 hayes or brentson to side with me but they left the<br>
                 store or something..GAY. whatever, i still coulda won<br>
                 but with his drains at tatoooine and 3rd marker he<br>
                 makes short work of me...full loss by 12. <br>
                 Highs: nada <br>
                 Lows: plenty...i would have won by 20-25 if i don&#146;t get<br>
                 assed by ice storm. I made other mistakes too. <br>
                 Other...32 rating points...no! <br>
<br>
                 gemme lost again to somebody, hayes beat klema<br>
                 again. brentson won, steebo lost. <br>
<br>
                 I play steebo next...basically he is playing the hoth<br>
                 deck, some shady @#$% was going on with him but<br>
                 i wont go into that &#146;cuz i dont want to diss on my buy<br>
                 steebo, plus it didn&#146;t effect the outcome of the<br>
                 game...He drops 2 ships early and lat damage on<br>
                 theron nett...i lose him and like 8 force. I try to pull<br>
                 the win outta my @#$% by playing celebration and<br>
                 @#$% but he is too strong in space and all my<br>
                 pilots are on the wrong ships(wtf?...dash on the<br>
                 falcon, melas on wedge&#146;s ship and wedge on the<br>
                 skate). It was a cool game with alot of interaction but<br>
                 basically every battle i either had to lose a guy or<br>
                 2-3 force and i couldn&#146;t handle it...late game garrison<br>
                 wins him the game. Full loss by 18. <br>
                 Highs: Playing steebo <br>
                 Lows: I hate the hoth deck! <br>
                 Other-hayes own again as did klema, gemme lost<br>
                 again. <br>
<br>
                 Well i am pretty depressed right now, i am 2-3 but i<br>
                 knowi will win my last game becausei get paired<br>
                 against some newbie...Not much detail on this one, i<br>
                 duel luke, he loses 18 force, i win the race...win by<br>
                 33? <br>
                 Highs: nada <br>
                 Lows: i had to explain to him what an objective was. <br>
                 Other...see what i mean about ct? <br>
<br>
                 So i finish 3-3...not very good but i had fun. My rating<br>
                 will suffer a 60 point hit. So the tourney is over,<br>
                 hayes wins it going 6-0 plus 151(!!!). brentson is<br>
                 second steebo 3rd. mass in 1st and 3rd<br>
                 place...ohhhhhyeaaah. <br>
<br>
                 So we wrap up the tourney and i sell a qui gonn to a<br>
                 kid for $30 so i can now eat...me, hayes, steebo,<br>
                 deck, oakes(male striper/td down in conn...maybe<br>
                 you&#146;ve heard of him?) and klema head off to<br>
                 applebees. On the way me and gemme have a<br>
                 discussion about ds jedi testing for women vs. ls<br>
                 testing for women. The conversation is cool esp<br>
                 since we are in separate cars...i tell him he is turning<br>
                 to the darkside and he is like, noooooo! <br>
                 We get in to apple bees and our host/greeter is mad<br>
                 hot and gemme gets his moves in with her and i give<br>
                 him props for that. We take our seats and talk<br>
                 testing and somehow racing gets mixed<br>
                 in...everyone is all about how gemme is dominating<br>
                 me but honestly our waitress is balz and both me and<br>
                 gemme just dont bother after a while because she is<br>
                 just plain nasty. Everyone is like gemme&#146;s testing is<br>
                 so much better, and i am like, maybe you lose a few<br>
                 games with ds testing but, every once and a while,<br>
                 you get the full win by 46  and it is all worth<br>
                 while. Everyone laughs, then thinks about it and is<br>
                 like, &quot;true&quot;. We talk some more about how gemme<br>
                 should be spider man and not tobey mcguire and<br>
                 how steebo is harry osborne...klema&#146;s gotta be flash<br>
                 tompson, and i am james dean even though he has<br>
                 nothing to do with spiderman. <br>
<br>
                 We also realize(or i realize how teched out my<br>
                 phone number is. Here is why, i say some how,<br>
                 somewhere, there is game of star wars going on<br>
                 where a guy is drawing nine battle destinies in this<br>
                 oreder, 617, 566, 4046. Everyone is like you are<br>
                 homo and i am all proud of my phone number<br>
                 because all the numbers are legal destiny numbers. I<br>
                 make fun of gemme and hayes because they break<br>
                 the rules with just their area codes(978...what the<br>
                 phuck is that? you got two illegal numbers in just<br>
                 the area code!!) <br>
<br>
                 Well we eat our food and gemme flashes the<br>
                 applebees but read his tr for more info on that...we<br>
                 leave and try to flash some more but it doesn&#146;t really<br>
                 work. <br>
<br>
                 We head back to mass....we try to mack these<br>
                 blondes in a convertible but some harley type dudes<br>
                 get to em first(my ds testing buddies no doubt). We<br>
                 eventually pull up to em but they ain&#146;t that great so<br>
                 we say phuck it. Ride home was cool though. Major<br>
                 props to gemme for driving. <br>
                 I ended up sleeping at hayes house on sat night and<br>
                 am the king of saying card titles to match the mood<br>
                 that night, like eric is putting cream cheese on<br>
                 a baggle and i am like, you may start your<br>
                 landing...i dunno, it was good. Next morning i go to<br>
                 the train station and go back to my house and sleep.<br>
                 good weekend. <br>
<br>
                 major props-- <br>
                 Mike gemme, you cool man, nice game we had, you<br>
                 owned me this weekend. Good stuff driving too altho<br>
                 i offered to help you out. <br>
<br>
                 Props- <br>
