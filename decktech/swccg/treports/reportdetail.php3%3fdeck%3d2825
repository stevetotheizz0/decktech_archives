His wasnt even half assed, it was more like 1/3 assed. maybe even less. oh, and bob jones real name is Zeq Rudy, ya know, cause hes a big @#$% and wont give out his real name, i bet his mommy made him hide his identity. oh well, on to the TR<br>
<br>
--- pre-tourney stuff ---<br>
<br>
well, i knew that i wasnt going to do so well because coruscant was out and i didnt get any. i did manage to borrow a mauls strikes and traded for phantom menace, no match for you and another maul strikes for my HD deck. even though i had a little coruscant, i still had no idea what the new decks did, and that was bad. political effect and the new politician objs are like mini ops, they suck. so i decided to play what i played at dpc atlanta, slightly modified to be a little better, WYS racing and HD that *DOESNT* place the obj out of play (yeah, i dont know what the hell i was thinking, i must be going insane, since i am the king of placing my own obj out of play)<br>
<br>
<br>
--- end pre tourney stuff ---<br>
<br>
LS: WYS Racing<br>
DS: Hunt Down Dueling<br>
<br>
oh yea, i probably wont use last names because i didnt ask for them. if you see a last name its because i knew it before the game.<br>
<br>
Game 1 DS vs Drew Scott&#146;s (1800) Coruscant deck that i didnt know what it did<br>
<br>
well, atleast it wasnt politicians. he got a first turn qui gon, and well, that qui gon live the entire game, making me stack 7 or 8 cards on credits will do fine. maul came down with 4-lom, but i still couldnt get rid of him. battle, 4lom shot qui gon so no more text, then qui gon excludes maul, ends battle. well that sucked. next turn ki-adi-mundi comes down, and soaks attrition and makes me stack another card on CWDF. he never came to contest zuckuss and bossk in space, who drained for one just about all game. he search for the pilots to the Radiant VII alot, and never found them. after maul and vader all died, qui gon drained me out. <br>
FL -27?<br>
0(-27)<br>
Highs: seeing new coruscant<br>
Lows: seeing new coruscant<br>
ugly: invincible qui gon<br>
<br>
Game 2 LS vs Eric&#146;s (1400-1500s?) Random high destiny weapons deck<br>
<br>
well, eric seemed pretty new to the game, this was only his second or third tourney (and only my 4th or 5th tourney) so i thought i would have an easy win. but no. this kid put up a REAL fight. i couldnt get the lock going on him (the lock being kessel and cantina drains) i had a bad hand and couldnt get a first turn ship to kessel, so i settled for drawing some, and saving (oh yeah, he started the DS so i went first, and it proved to be his only location) the falcon and outrider came to kessel, to fight his Black 4 with reserve pilot, scimtar 2 and DSSD. well, falcon got rolled, despite the fact that i drew a 6 for my destiny. so seeing that, i decided to not battle him, and i had no force to move away, so i was basically screwed (battle plan and order were on table so battles were free). Then he beat on the outrider, but it covered. i got luke down the the cantina to beat on the survivors of an earlier melas and rfc vs epp fett and stormtrooper battle. luke did the job, but dvdlots came down next turn with his DSII saber, chopped luke, but since he wasnt f=0 i lost no overflow damage. that made me a little mad, you know, falcon getting rolled, luke dying, so i dropped another luke, who weapon levd vaders saber, battled, over powered him and made him lose 2 force. he moved vader away into an awaiting at-st the next turn, instead of battling luke. well, melas and chewie came down to beat on the at-st and he had to lose vader from inside it to cover. falcon went back to space, but it got hit by missiles but it covered. it got down the the end where i was paying 9 to drain for 5, and he was paying 6 to drain for 3, but then he couldnt pay anymore, because he had one force left with about 5 minutes to go. so he sits there and thinks, and i begin to get impatient after a minute or two, asking him to hurry up. then he starts whistling and making conversation with people watching our game, which was totally uncalled for. then, with a minute left, he said go (after much pleading for him to hurry up) and i drained him, winning by 18<br>
FW +17<br>
2(-10)<br>
highs: winning, a FULL win<br>
lows: falcon getting killed twice, luke getting beat on<br>
ugly: him trying to stall it into a timed loss so he would get rating points or something, this is the least my WYS deck has ever won by.. and it was a sloppy win, ugly!<br>
<br>
Game 3 LS vs Zeq Rudy (1500s) Politicians<br>
<br>
yeah, this was bad, neither of us knew how his deck worked, but he knew better than i did, plus i was bragging and now i was gonna lose so i suck times 2. it ended up being a lame @#$% game with me running and him playing some game effect on kessel so i could only drain him for 1 there. now if i knew that card existed, i would have only drained for 2, but no, i was at a disadvantage. then he spreads his droids all out and starts draining with them after i am getting low on force. so, i end up getting my @#$% beat, and lose by 27 to a really gay deck. i hate politics almost as much as i said i would!<br>
FL -27<br>
2(-37)<br>
highs: playing zeq finally<br>
lows: losing to zeq<br>
ugly: losing to zeq, and mini-ops<br>
<br>
Game 4 DS vs Gennaro (no clue) Profit<br>
ok, now i can go 2-2, hopefully. he starts racing, so i put out my sebulbas racer, knowing with the 20 or so 6s in my deck, i might be able to win, and screw him over a little.<br>
he starts Ou Nee Tay or so vader doesnt come down early. vader comes down second turn, after he just draws. vader finds his friend 4lom and they sit at the ds dbay until qui gon comes down to tat:jp , when i pick him up (getting rid of his uncontrollable fury, hahaha) and put him down next turn to fight qui gon, but qui gon moved, so i just stuck him down on tat to drain for 2 or 3. luke made and apperance with twass khaa, and i didnt like that, so mara came down, dueled him, added a destiny with focused attack, and won the duel 21-10 or something insane like that. he chose to lose 6 and cross luke. well, i noticed that it was still my deploy phase, so i moved on to my battle phase, and beat the crap out of twass for 14 overflow damage, and that about did it. he spent the rest of the game running from vader and luke, although mara died to attrition once. visage ate at us the whole game as i couldnt get maul to do away with qui gon. he tried to alter/friendly fire me, but his destiny was a 5, +4 because of HD, so that didnt work, i found it funny, hehe. he won the race because i only got one good destiny on my racer, and i forgot to flash him once. didnt make much difference, except then he manage to free han and get 10 back. come here you big coward is totally going into my deck. vader and luke beat on han and qui gon, i chop them both because we let luke use his saber, cause i forgot he couldnt. that flipped his obj, and he had no way to recover, so we lost to visage and i drained him for 3 a turn, and won by 13<br>
FW +13<br>
4(-19)<br>
highs: dueling luke<br>
lows: leaving qui gon alone to free han<br>
ugly: the twass beat down<br>
<br>
<br>
i got 6th, and picked the control/tv combo for my prize support.<br>
