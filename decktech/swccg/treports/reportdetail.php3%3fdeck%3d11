<br>
 there were 17 people there, 5 over 1800, 2 over 1900, and 3 over 1700.. i won with a total of 12 points and 125 differential with 2 wins over my brother (the other 1900 ranked player).... a description of my decks and the tournament follows... <br>
<br>
LS- MWYHL battle/high destiny except teched out to counter manipulation and hunt down (read 2 shocking revos, 2 Transmission terminated, and 2 grabbers)... the more i play this deck, the more i like it, it has everything, EPP beatdown, anti everything tech, high destiny, counter assaults, immunity to attrition, retreival, the ability to fight on the ground or in the air, and it takes enough skill to play with that when little kids copy it, its not that hard to win against..  which isnt all that inadmerable of a quality.. anyhow, this deck performs well against everything, as long as you know what youre doing, and play your cards right... <br>
<br>
DS-CCT drazin manipulator that uses 9 screws, 2 myoom, 4 monnok, 4 sense, 5 alter and tons of characters.. its kinda light on the insert protection, but it can seriously mess with peoples characters, and can go into straight kill mode pretty quick... other than that, its strong against most decktypes (needed some #s protection, but other than that its ok) and works pretty well.. needs some fine tuning before the regional.. ill post my list later.. speaking of which, can somone post thier list of CCT drazin? i think i missed the one that got posted before.. <br>
<br>
anyways, on with the tournament... <br>
<br>
game 1: my LS vs. somebodys DS ISB big blue space deck<br>
<br>
This is the game i fear.. 12 star destroyers, 20+ characters and beatdown with undercovers, and etc.  for the first few turns he draws up looking for a system, and i complete the 2 tests and fish for the projection im looking for.. i set up the drain for 2 at the holosite, while he pays to drain at kashyyk.. i ICBW one drain for 1, he its worse for 14, i play a counter assault on the drain (now for 15), pick a 6, and lose 3 instead of 15.. at this point, i retreive with ote, and he lays endor, and moves 20 power over there.. next turn, i lay the falcon, han, luke, tantive iv, wedge, and some other fatties, battle, draw an 11 (5,6) battle destiny (i layed them with traffic control) and waste a star destroyer and a pilot... next turn i get smacked with 2 SDs and a few pilots and a battle, DTF is on table so i lose one, i end up losing wedge + biggs or something.. next turn i lay spiral and battle, after pulling wedge off the bacta.. draw the 11 again, nail 3 ORS and a victory class, he gets some guy... next turn he lays another 2 SDS and battles, i draw a 9 attrition, he picks a 6, i layed the spiral as a react, so i lose only wedge, he loses a couple more pilots.. hes retreiving one pilot a turn with ISB, so the assault is kinda mounting, but my drain at the holotable is whittling him down too, and my OTE to clean up my lost pile helps out too..  at one point his power gets to 72 to my 50, so i forfeit like mad and run away... by that point he cant drain and follow with all his power (ive killed most of his characters, and hes left with a whole bunch of SDs), so hes stuck moving the stack around while i drain at the holotable and retreive with OTE.. eventually, obi comes down at the CC corridor to increase the hurt, and the game ends quickly... <br>
<br>
result: full win by 30+ ... 2 (+30)<br>
highlights: beating the deck my deck has the most problems with<br>
lowlights: having 60+ power of star destroyers on the table, and having his 7 forfeit (thanks to IAO) characters recycle with ISB<br>
<br>
Game 2: My DS vs. Dagobah asteroids<br>
<br>
He lays dagobah, and i lay CHYBC... i didnt know this when the game started, but this ended the game right there.. he has a set of EPPs,. MWYHL, and basic asteroid sanctuary on dagobah.. he lays an X-wing at 2 of the asteroids and the big one, and an AS on his turn one.. ive deployed the cantina and moved brangus glee there... i decide to hold on the alter in my hand (it wont work anyways) and just draw up for the other drain 2 site i have in my force pile and lay drazin on CC along with SD... he makes me lose 4 for the AS, i draw for one of his ships in the sectors, pick a 3, kill it and the AS (since he doesnt occupy 2 battlegrounds)... the rest of the game goes like that.. i myoom and screw all his characters, and retreive whatever he drains with drazin..  eventually, tarkin in a DSSD comes out and squashes an X-wing for 7 force, and cancels an AS... he lays s-foils, but i manage to alter it through the +4, and they all die from asteroid destiny the following turn anyway..  easy game with me monnoking lost every turn he has a double.. <br>
<br>
result: win by 31 4(+61)<br>
highlights: beating cheese.. some neat tricks with destiny and not playing down to my opponent<br>
lowlights: playing cheese vs. cheese and coming out on top.. <br>
<br>
Game 3 My DS vs. My bros Rescue the princess<br>
<br>
My brothers deck is heavy on retreival, and has HUGE destinies, so i can get screwed if im not careful.. its also STACKED against manipulators.. anyways, i hope for a vader first turn so i can walk the princess over to CC, but no luck, so i go for screws.. he hands me a 4 point loss, so i trap the shock, and lay drazin when i take his only rebel... put down SD, retreive a screw and a monnok, pick up a cantina.. his turn he draws up a couple, i screw at the end of his turn, see 2 bothans and a han EPP and chewie EPP, no anti screw, i nail han... activate a ton, search my deck for brangus glee, lay him at the cantina.. the cantina drain screws him, i nail most of his characters.. eventually he manages to get out luke and some spys and rescue leia, but im draining for too much in too many places and he cant nabrun to any of them, so its tough on him.. he eventually nails drazin, removes him from play, but my battle order screws him and some fine play at the end saves aaron from total death.. <br>
<br>
results: win by 7 6 (+68)<br>
highlights: beating heavy beatdown and force retreival with tons of counters to what im playing<br>
lowlights: i made 2 mistakes in this game that cost me about 10 differential.. NOT good<br>
<br>
Game 4 My LS vs. Aarons Tatooine occupation manipulator<br>
<br>
My deck is stacked against this.. i get the holotable out early and start wasting him there.. he gets occupation, but HAn and luke in the falcon take over.. he plays a few characters at sites to try and drain, obi + saber, wedge, and a clash take out jabba and EPP fett + some force.. basically, i outplay him, and outtech him.. the highlight is me taking out his first turn myoom with a first turn daughter of skywalker, and then using the tank to kill her and get her to dagobah to train... a well played game again by aaron, but my deck was too strong.. grapple cards stop me from massive retreival... <br>
<br>
result: full win by 9 8 (+77)<br>
highlights: leia taking out both myoom and vader<br>
lowlights:playing against a manipulator<br>
<br>
Game 5 My LS vs. TIm Mayers TIE SFS Odds deck<br>
<br>
i hate cheese.. when im not playing with tons of insert direct damage, having to play with people that do just makes me mad :).. im allowed a certain double standard of course ;).. seriously, this game goes alot like the first one.. i get the holotable, and track my anti #s cards, shuffling my reserve (and letting him look through) where necessary to randomize odds.. i pull out all the old anti #s play strategy from the pre counter era, and basically stop his damage cold.. i trap the aptw and he runs out pretty quick.. i commence beating the heck out of TIEs and dreadnoughts with my small fleet drawing huge destinies, and with milwaukee taken over, he has trouble playing TIEs to fight anyways.. all the TIE stuff ends up dragging out this game unnesessarily, and drains my differential a little, but a late game surprise assault takes care of it pretty easily (my diff. wouldve been the same either way).. <br>
<br>
result: win by 15<br>
highlight: beating #s with this deck.. that was a concern.. watching my deck work yet again<br>
lowlights: having to pull out all that old numbers crap.. remembering why i hated dagobah era games.. <br>
<br>
Game 6 My DS vs Tim Mayers Hidden Base #s deck<br>
<br>
after the first screw of this game, im wondering what it is with this kid and space #s.. after inquiring, i find out that he wants to win.. go figure.. anyways, he has no rebels, so im retreiving one per turn.. i look at his hand turn one, he has 8d8, artoo and an insert.. i dont have resistance.. im in trouble.. he has no characters in hand, so i search for myoom and move her to the cantina... he plays his combo... he has the dreaded battle plan out, so i lay drazin at LMF, and branguss glee at the Carbon chamber with Potf.. i have a destiny of 9 at this point, so its in me to try and win the game with these characters out.. i draw up, and thank god one of the cards is a DSSD...  he doesnt have all the systems out at this point, so hes not even bothering to pay the 3 to drain, he lays a few random ships and a system and picks up.. i activate all my force, #s comes up and i lose 2 (i monnoked a pair of droids out and sensed a HDWGITM) but i drain for 6 and retreive a force, so im not doing too bad.. i lay my DSSD in space after checking him with a screw, and send him on his way..  he cant make it to yavin from the rp, so he gets kessel and inserts me again, and draws up until he gets one droid.. i activate hoping to pop the insert, but no luck.. i retreive the other force, and drain for 8 total.. monnok a couple of corvettes and draw a few screws.. leave some force just in case.. he plays WNMOG on his turn, i alter, plays his last system and flips, i probe yavin, its not his base... he moves to occupy two systems and makes it my turn.. i scan, he has nothing too great, so i drain him of 4 total, decide its better to leave my DSSD than to get it pounded at his hidden base (where presumable his 7 + ships are).. so i let him go.. he pays 6 to drain me of 4.. it goes on like that with him paying and me not, and me shuffling my deck after activating with the CC console... i pull out all the stops on old school counters and only one more #s comes up the whole game for 6 which doesnt bother me all that bad... i never bother to probe the HB, and my 1 per turn retreival works out fine.. <br>
<br>
results: win by 33<br>
highlights; beating another straight out cheese deck. playskilling someone to death<br>
lowlights: playing against another #s deck..... i thought these things were dead.. i need a resistance in my deck.. <br>
<br>
<br>
 i won the tournament at 12 + 125, beat a 1900 player twice and a 1800 player once.. overall a good showing..  anyways, a few of my games took a while, so a lot of the people watched my decks, and everyone was trading for CCT objectives after the tournament.. its really too bad that not everyone has demotion tech in their decks isnt it?.. but seriously, im anticipating dealing with at least 5 or 6 1800 players with manipulators next week and i dont know how i feel about that.. there were already a couple people playing carbon copies of the mornout deck there... i didnt really see too many counters to DS numbers though, my deck was one of the few that packed them... my LS fought a whole bunch of battles in space, and the bacta tank is the new mvp of the millenium as far as thats concerned... i keep wavering between working with the drazin thing, or just going with some kind of ISB mains deck with plenty of anti revo tech.. maybe working in some kind of imperial justice start or something vs. throne room nudj (which only 2 players had this tournament.. the same # had harvest decks...).. <br>
