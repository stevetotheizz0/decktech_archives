Short Deck Intro : <br>
LS-HB/ Mains<br>
DS- Musicians<br>
<br>
 Game 4 : ' The Wretched' v. Leonard Mitchell's Tatooine<br>
Celebration deck...<br>
<br>
Start : CotVG w/ 3 Effect thing. Obi's Hut ,convert <br>
Audience Chamber. Ok. First off this was probably my<br>
best game of the day ... the Slugfest with Ira were <br>
maybe a miniscule under this game.  He deploys Tawss Khaa<br>
to the Jundland Wastes ( his ) and draws up. I go and get<br>
my Docking Bays while I drop Hutt Smooches to my objective<br>
for damage. He hits me a few times with the drain of 2 before<br>
I set up Battle Order and the game starts moving along. <br>
He deploys Cantina , Mos Eisley , Tatooine system ,<br>
and one more random.tatooine.site and sets up Celebration<br>
with Gold Leader and Wedge I think. So here's the setup : <br>
AChamber ( He won't go here ) , Entrance Cavern , Jabba's <br>
Palace , Sarlacc , Hut , Eisley , Cantina , Tatooine. I <br>
decide to try to stop his moving Harc Seff , EPP Luke , <br>
and Tawss Khaa by tempting an Elis... BTW he has like +20<br>
cards in hand so he grapples it and Senses it ( Loses 2 <br>
more ) , I play another one and it gets through but he <br>
Nabruns them all away back to like Mos Eisley ( Next time<br>
Gadget ). He also has Boussh out but he keeps forgetting to<br>
move her and stuff so he decides to make her useful. I <br>
decide to strike up at the system. Zuckuss in Hunter , an <br>
Outer Rim Scout , and Rappertunie go up the Tatooine system<br>
to beat up on the Gold Leader. He throws some junk up there<br>
but here is the basic situation he has a drain of 4 <br>
( Cantina and Jundland Wastes ) , Celebration for 2 , and <br>
Order to Engage is out. I have Zuckuss in Hunter , ORS , <br>
and Rappertunie up at Tatooine , Jabba Boelo and 4-LOM a <br>
Jabba's Palace , Mara Jade w/stick Evazan Sy Snootles and <br>
like Brangus at Entrance Cavern , and enough musicians at <br>
the Audience Chamber to hold it. He puts down like Lando in<br>
Falcon , Tantive 4 , and some pilots to help up in space. <br>
They knock off Rappertunnie and my Outer Rim Scout <br>
and he puts a Gimer Stick on Boushh after breaking cover <br>
and moves Boushh to the 'Ley Jabba no boder' site ( Jabba <br>
,4-LOM , Boelo ). Hmm. He also has Tatooine Celebration out<br>
but is at least paying for Secret Plans. He knocks out my <br>
ORS and Rapster and retrieves and then it is my turn. <br>
I finally get a few good shots of Un Harc Seff-able drains<br>
in so he is starting to take some solid damage. I decide <br>
to take the 3 on the chin and land the Zuckuss in Hunter <br>
at the Le Jabba No Boder site. He does his drains and junk<br>
but he is in trouble now and he thinks the space system is <br>
safe. He starts dropping down Jereon Webb and other pilots<br>
he had up there to get more force for Celebrating. Hehe...<br>
I remember I retrieved Fett in his ride a few turns back so<br>
I activate about 7 force... deploy Fett from Reserve with <br>
the Objective battle ...retrieve 3 Force , draw a 5 to take<br>
down another ship , and then bring up the SUPA SHIP. <br>
Remember that Zuckuss in Hunter that landed well now he has<br>
4-LOM , Boelo , Jabba , and an Outer Rim Scout (translation<br>
: 2 destinies , 7 power , cancel your destiny) that spells<br>
doom for him. I get to drain for free and he holds the <br>
system for maybe 2 or 3 more celebrations but I've got him<br>
now. I just made Boussh useless again because if she <br>
moves over she'll get destroyed by Mara Jade and company.<br>
He shuttles EPP Luke and Boussh up to the system but they <br>
go down pretty quickly with me drawing 2 destinies and <br>
such.  I also throw Chell Bekan out to battle Harc Seff and<br>
retrieve 3 more while he loses 1. In the end I manage to <br>
eek it out by 8. Win by 8 . Record : 6 ( +22 ) <br>
<br>
Highlights : Excellent game… my  best game of the weekend.<br>
Lowlights : Nothing really.<br>
<br>
Game 5 : ' The Fragile' v. Hugh Shelton's Tatooine <br>
Occupation<br>
<br>
Well he starts Tatooine and Security Precautions and I <br>
start everything And grab Wise Advice. I go get systems <br>
and get my generation up Very quickly while he deploys the<br>
Jundland Wastes and later puts A PotF on it so that is when<br>
I decide I can commit Luke and Obi To the Wastes while on<br>
later turns I re-inforce it with Jeroen Webb , Tawss Khaa ,<br>
and Corporal Beezer. The first time he attacks it with <br>
Choke Vader , Mara , Tarkin , and Dengar to which I lose <br>
Beezer to a choke and Tawss gets hit by Dengar , I slash <br>
Tarkin and Dengar and attrition out Mara. I play Gift of <br>
the Mentor for multiple destinies but he plays Boring <br>
Conversation Anyway which I grapple just in case. Here is<br>
something…I have a Skywalkers in hand and I play Tunnel <br>
Vision and see EPP Leia in there so I grab her and look at<br>
my hand again and see that my Skywalkers is gone ! WTF ?<br>
I'm a bit baffled and guess that I put it into my Active<br>
Pile so I just deploy Leia anyway and battle Versus Vader<br>
and beat him down for him and like 5-6 after him which<br>
Would've been much worse with the Skywalkers. He deploys<br>
U-3PO To the Wastes to shut down my drains so I throw the<br>
Falcon to Kashyyyk for the deploy -2 for Cpn Han and throw<br>
EPP Leia with him. Later he comes after me with Vader , <br>
Veers , Brangus , and a few others but gets another Gift <br>
from the Mentor which clears them out again. He gets<br>
The Devastator  down at Tatooine or some where and I <br>
deploy Order to Engage and start chasing him around while <br>
I track A Few Manuevers and Play On the Edge to retrieve <br>
back 5 force each time. He runs the Devastator To Dagobah<br>
and probes but I tell him to take the probe card because <br>
it can only be 2-8 parsec but with Dagobah Rules he can't <br>
deploy to Dagobah so he has to eat the 3 to Order to Engage<br>
and so I keep following the Devastator around and hit him<br>
for probably like 12 force before he probes the right <br>
system . I It Could Be Worse the damage and keep rolling <br>
after him. Eventually he battles and Ghhhks but I play<br>
Legendary Starfighter which hurts him some more before he<br>
is dead. Not much he could do this game. Win by 20-26 I <br>
think. <br>
<br>
Highlights : Deck working fine. <br>
<br>
Lowlights: Beating a friend of mine pretty badly right after <br>
coming Back into the game. He didn't really have a chance <br>
this whole game.<br>
<br>
Game 6 : 'The Wretched' v. Clint Hays' Clackdor 7 Ops<br>
<br>
Heh. He starts normal Op stuff and I start Court with B O.<br>
I'll summarize this from EPP Luke's point of view since he<br>
was deployed 3 times. First time he walks into the Audience<br>
Chamber but notices a cut in his arm so he can't swing his<br>
saber and just takes out the ORS who was anxious to plunder<br>
his weapon for sale on the black market, next time he was <br>
deployed he slashed Jabba and took out another musician <br>
before dying this time. Last time he is deployed  he is a <br>
bit too overconfident…he is wise to Clash Fett and hits<br>
someone with his stick and attrition but he should've <br>
known some serious smackdown was gonna be coming<br>
when I didn't draw battle destiny. Sometimes not drawing<br>
battle destiny is Tech versus EPPs J Well lets just say<br>
EPP Luke might've had his weapon when he was obliterated<br>
But it wasn't in his hand…it was probably stuck where the<br>
Double suns of Tatooine never shined. Win by 26.<br>
Record : 10 ( +70 ) <br>
<br>
Highlights : Pretty much everything.<br>
Lowlights : putting serious smackdown on a bud. <br>
<br>
So I go 5-1 with +70 differential and get 4th place which<br>
Is good for the Uncommon sheet of Premiere for Light Side.<br>
Charlie Herren came in 1st with Throne Room Mains and <br>
Ralltiir Ops. After the tournament we go to the Holiday<br>
Inn and play like 8 hours of video game between me ,<br>
Lee , Dan , Charlie Herren , Ira , and Andreas. Charlie<br>
Was the only one who got any sleep. Heh…I have to<br>
Tell you guys about the Holiday Inn's little bar called<br>
The Austin Texas Steakhouse Saloon ;)  Ira told me the<br>
Miami crew would be in there so I'm going in there <br>
Thinking I'll spot them or anybody I know. I don't see<br>
Them and I start to notice that people are staring at me<br>
And Dan because we are underage. So I feel a little<br>
Weird and go to the bar and get a menu. The guy says<br>
We have to go sit somewhere else because we are minors.<br>
You guys ever see that famous painting where there is<br>
Starcases going everywhere and you really can't tell<br>
Where the ceiling is ? Well this place has 3 levels and<br>
Is like that because there is staircases going everywhere<br>
And mirrors so it is crazy looking…if you were drunk<br>
There you'd never find the exit. So me and Dan collapse<br>
Into a booth seat and watch an old Party of 5 while there<br>
Is a band playing. Watching Jennifer Love Hewitt with<br>
No sound is TECH. We crack a few jokes and the<br>
Waitress comes up there. Heh… Dan is his usual wise<br>
Ass self and after awhile I find that the waitress is <br>
Hitting on him…he's like 15-16 hell I don't even know<br>
But he looks younger and she was like old enough to be<br>
His mother so I was cracking up about it later.  And<br>
I was able to meet a bunch of people. Old people that I<br>
Was able to see for the first time in a long time was Hugh<br>
Shelton and Mitchell Velasco. New faces were John Arendt ,<br>
Leonard Mitchell , and $cott Anderson. <br>
<br>
Props : <br>
-Leonard Mitchell , Ira Myers , and Clint Hays for the <br>
      super games. <br>
-All the cool people I was able to meet. <br>
-Having Fun and doing well.<br>
<br>
Slops : <br>
- Getting no sleep.<br>
- Not having Traffic Control in which would've given me<br>
Another 30 points of differential but I still wouldn't <br>
Have gotten 2nd place so I didn't really care. <br>
<br>
And to finish off the whole TR with my favorite quote of <br>
The weekend : <br>
<br>
'I'm sitting across from the man Decipher fears the most<br>
[Ozymandias] and he is wearing a Mickey Mouse T-Shirt'.<br>
-Clint Hays at the start of Game 4. <br>
