For Star Wars Gaming Fans: <br>
<br>
Here is some information about the events Wizards of the Coast are holding at Celebration II for the Star Wars Trading Card Game.<br>
<br>
On Saturday May 4th from 10:00AM to 12:00PM Wizards of the Coast will be holding question and answer seminar with Star Wars TCG game designer Richard Garfield as well as Star Wars TCG game developers Robert Gutschera and David Eckelberry. <br>
<br>
At 1:00 bring a deck and participate in the Star Wars TCG Skirmish, a "King of the Hill" event. This will be the first large event for the Star Wars TCG and a chance for you to play against Richard, Robert, and David. Every time you play you will earn Star Wars TCG Attack of the Clones booster packs. Also, door prizes of complete sets and booster packs will be randomly given out to participants throughout the Skirmish. <br>
<br>
The top players in the Skirmish on Saturday will be invited to play in the "Final Battle" that afternoon. As first prize we are excited to be offering a limited edition Han Solo Blaster from Master Replicas. Additionally, first place will also receive a complete Attack of the Clones set for the Star Wars TCG. Other top players will also receive complete Attack of the Clones sets. <br>
<br>
Don't worry if you don't know how to play or just started playing. Demonstrations, deck building, and strategy clinics will be held starting at 1:00 on both Saturday and Sunday. Also, on Sunday we will be holding small 8-player tournaments.  <br>

Well, here's the background and historical perspective from me, resident historian here.  <br>
<br>
Most of the people at DeckTech came here when it was all about SWCCG.  So naturally, they still feel a strong alliegance to that game.  In all actuality, SWCCG was(is) a great game, one of the best ever, IMHO.  The manufacturor, Decipher, despite being great fans of Star Wars themselves, with continual bad marketing/development, bungled away their relation with LucasFilm, and lost their license to WOTC.  Decipher is well known to be hostile to Wizards of the Coast and has frequently put out the general attitude (many times indirectly but sometimes more - all Decipher volunteers are prohibited from volunteering with WOTC) that WOTC is their enemy, and the enemy of the people who play Decipher games.<br>
<br>
Now whether this is the case, I suppose only WOTC knows, but they've supported many Star Wars events through their SW fan club, even picking up the SWCCG (and YJ and Jedi Knights) World Championship support a year ago, which was more than Decipher did.  To me, they seem to be fans of SW and their games, which I appreciate, but that again is MHO.  So when you see people around here railing against Wizards of the Coast, or the new game, that's the background.  Decipher has bred an aura of hostility towards anything WOTC, and people take time to change, if at all.<br>
<br>

If you act like knob and insult the orgs. that DT solicites sponsorship or support from, then they can well withdraw their support, and then you have no DeckTech. DT has never dis'd its old members in support of the new game, it's just that things will get pretty stale fast if all DT is about is LSC and <br>
WYS for forever and a day.<br>

Bottomline is that no one has to play the game.  There is no one forcing you.

<br>
Support who you want or dis who you want but face facts people.  WOTC did what they did for one reason and that's $$.  They care as little about the fans as D did.  WOTC "bailed" out Worlds last year to ingratiate people to them.  They knew they were getting the license and decided to use the situation to their advantage.  Duh, thet's PR people.  That's what companies do, try all they can to make $$.  D and WOTC ARE THE SAME.  They care only about themeselves and their bottom line.  Argueing semantics is pointless.<br>
<br>
Don't fault DT for supporting a SW activity, even if it does have to do with the new game.  I feel the obverse should be recognized as well.  Some people DO NOT want to support WOTC, so don't try to make them look bad either, Neal.<br>

It's a game from a good company, and it's star wars.  And they've been very pleasant to DeckTech.  You know it'll sell, and most of the reports I hear are favorable.  Plus, I think it'd be fun for DT to have some new members, other than typical crowd.  So therefore, you are getting the choice of it here.

While this may be true of a few, so far the largest SWTCG fan base are either new players or players with open minds that realized from the beggining a "boycott" would have been a lost cause.  The game appeals to a much larger audience than just SWCCG players.<br>
Also, if someone did say they were going to boycott it, then after seeing how fun it is to play changed their mind, what's wrong with that?  To continue to deny yourself something you know you will like out of pure stubborness is ridiculous.</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2>Aaron Brogdon</font><font face=arial size=2> - Sat Apr 20 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2>I will not boycott this new tcg but I will sit back and watch what happens. If it dies then I will just say I told you so. If it booms like pokemon then I will still just play old wars. The fact is is that there will be 4 games of different varitations out there for starwars; Young jedi, Starwars ccg, Jedi Knights, and now Starwars Tcg. Reason why I don't think it will catch much attention is bc of LOTR. A new expainsion of lotr will come out soon about the same time this new wars will be released. The players who play LOTR will buy LOTR instead of buying this new product out there. It will become another jedi knight, came out with the new expation of starwars and nobody was willing to put money into the game to buy the new cards but they bought the new wars set.</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2>jason wade</font><font face=arial size=2> - Mon Apr 22 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2>Anyone going to the celebration could you please e-mail me at drtorch@aol.com?

However, Neal, you might to not be actively 'supporting' WotC or their new game, but nothings for free. WotC advertise on DT, or at least they did, plus they helped you out big time with prizes at Freedomcon.<br>
i doubt they're doing that cause they like the look of you. i suspect they expect something in return, namely, Positive press for their new game on the biggest ccg site out there.<br>
Maybe its just conspiracy theory, or maybe the day will come when its time to pay the piper.<br>
