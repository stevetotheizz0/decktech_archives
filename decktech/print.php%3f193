<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Attention All Females: Want to be a DT Calendar Girl? posted by DeckTech on Wed May 29 2002 <br>With the introduction of new games Magi Nation Duel and Lord of the Rings, DeckTech.net is seeing something new lately: Girls.<br>
<br>
Due to a wacky idea followed by several requests and a few initial volunteers, DeckTech is planning on having a 6 month downloadable calendar featuring 6 girls from DeckTech!  This calendar will have various dates such as holidays and DPC or Convention info, and of course inluce a picture of the girl for the month.<br>
<br>
Now this is not a chauvinistic or exploitative venture, it is merely a chance to be part of something fun, if you so choose.<br>
<br>
If you are interested, send an email to project head <a href="mailto:alex@decktech.net">Alex Tennet</a> to see about joining.<br>
<br>
Multiple pictures for each person are fine, but only one of each person will be selected so that a maximum of people can participate.  In the event that there are many participators, 6 will be selected randomly, with some filtering due to picture quality.  It is open to all ages, races, whatever.<br>
<br>
So ladies, get your pictures ready and gain thousands of worshipful fans as part of the DeckTech Calendar!<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Wed May 29 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>neal said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>Ok, I'll be the first to admit, this is a crazy idea, even for us!  But hey, that's DT, we do crazy stuff.<br>
<br>
I think it'll be a lot of fun, and I look forward to having more girls involved in DT.  It's a real pleasant change.<br>
<br>
ok, discuss away.<hr>Adam Drake said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>Hey yo... <br>
<br>
Does the girl have to be a member of DT? Cuz I know that there are a few members (myself included) who have to have attractive GFs and/or wives who could spice up a calendar... Just a thought.<hr>Lisa Gansky said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>This is hilarious. :)<br>
--Lisa<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>I know it's pretty wacky, isn't it?  Lisa you sending a pic?<hr>Hannah Grimm said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>sure, why not?<br>
<hr>matt wehner said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>I have a picture of my dog I can submit.  she's gotta be better looking than some females I've seen play this game.  Except for Tiuli "ICE HEART" Anfossi - I'd put her up as my calander girl any day.....<hr>Brian Connolly said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>This is the first I've been back to DT in 9  months and I'm appalled by the chauvinist attitude. <br>
Incidentally, can u get the chicks to dress up as Arwen or Rosie Cotton? <hr>Charlie Herren said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>I actually thought this was a joke.. :p<hr>Andrew Howard said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>You guys might wanna remember that posting pictures of any minor without legal consent from their parents is a Class A Felony in most states, don't want some random parents suing DT :)<hr>Alex Tennet said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Just so everyone is clear, this is not my idea at all - it's actually Neal's (I wouldn't want to take the credit Neal, people should know where this blatant chauvanism comes from :). However I will indeed be accepting these submissions for use in DT's 2002 calendar. So if you want to see yourself alongside famous birds such as Kim Caton, Heidi Farinholt and Andie "McDowell" Howard of #1 player fame, please email. Letters of disgust should still go to neal@decktech.net however...(Disclaimer: one of the above listed lovely ladies may not appear for reasons of taste, decency and class A felony lawsuits).<hr>Mark Balderston said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>this made me laugh real hard.  heheh.  seriously, if people want to look at hot chicks, they don't visit LOTR:TCG sites.  Cheers<hr>Tim Guzman said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>One young lady, that will take the cake, plays here in Vegas.  Her name is Suann...She should send a picture.<hr>Matt Townend said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>man, I wish Natalie Portman was on Deck Tech.  *sobs*<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Guys, this is fun.  That's all.<br>
<br>
And for the record, I come up with a dumb idea like 100 times a day.  <b>Alex Tennet</b> *is* the one who pursued the dumb idea and convinced me to do it!<br>
<br>
And andrew, well, to forget something you have to have known it first.  I never heard that, are you sure that's the case?<hr>Lisa Gansky said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>What...you guys weren't kidding Neal? :)<hr>Andrew Howard said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Yeah, I'm sure, its a federal law part of the Internet Privacy Act or whatever they called it. Anyone under the age of 18 is protected from having their image posted on the internet without the express written consent of their legal guardian, as well as no child under 14 can give out their personal information without the same verification from their parents/guardian(s).<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Tuili and Myriam and the 2 pretiest girl playing card<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>I look like a girl, and I like boys, can I take part of that contest ?<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>ahhhhhhhhh how come the name i had writen ( jimmy chen ) changed to dominic gaudreault... <hr>Mike Humphries said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>  this all sounds fine and dandy...  however i think the alternate approach would work better...  instead of hot girls, you should take pictures of different shop owners arround the country...m kinda like the 7-UP truck drivers commercial...  just a thought<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Anyhow, out of curiosity I looked up the law on photographs and info gathering of minors and children through the internet.  Children, of course, are under 13 and there are parental consent restrictions.  However, there are no restriction to minors, it's not even bothered to be defined in the section.  Also, FL statutes had nothing either.<br>
<br>
If someone has any info to the contray, please contact either I or alex.<hr>christian cinder said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>This has been done before by gaming magazines: why not poll for our favorite CCG,TCG femmes. Of course, you'll have to secure the copyrights-but I feel this might be better than player photos.<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>that suggestion while interesting, is not even feasable.<hr>Jeff Peck said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>hahaha Dominic you like boys?  when are you going to play this game again? soon you wont be in the canada top 3.  and why does that guy want pictures of shop owners?<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>hehe i dont care ... ill just do good at a big tournement and that will put me in top 3 ... anyways we wont get any sponsor for canada ... so i have no motivation for rating... and as for boy yes i like them ... well actualy its more of a inside between my friends ... there is a player call jimmy chen and he is gay ... and he like us alot... i wanted to write that with his name but ... we cant use fake name :(  it changes back to our real name :(<hr>Chris Cicconi said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>I think we know why that guy wants to see card store owners....probably one of that Jimmy Chen guys "friends".<hr>Myriam Gimaiel said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>dom u ll work and u ll have the money for go there... u must go there if u do the top 3.          i am happy to learn u are gay  ;)<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Dom is gay?  I didn't know that.  I thought he was making some crazy joke or something.  I thought he had a girlfriend.<br>
<br>
Oh well, Dom you are still me hero, gay or not.<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Dom is gay?  I didn't know that.  I thought he was making some crazy joke or something.  I thought he had a girlfriend.<br>
<br>
Oh well, Dom you are still my hero, gay or straight.<hr>Henry Jicha said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>6 at random is wrong.  Should be 5 at random and Tiuli.<hr>jason baretta said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>while it does seem like a funny idea, doesn't it strike anyone else as a little sad?<hr>Myriam Gimaiel said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>i think its very funny .... why peaple  ll be sad for that ??? <hr>jason baretta said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>you don't think the idea of 10 000 DT members, ogling you while they clutch thier 'flaming brands' is kinda perverted?<hr>Dominic Gaudreault said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>hehe no , sorry :) i aint ... unfortunatly for us jimmy chen might be ... i dont care ... but he is always toutching our body when we are playing a lotr game... its hard to concentrate. hi neal<hr>Jeff Peck said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>why does everbody want tiuli to be in this?  i am reporting all of you to her mommy.  take that.  speaking of gay, i heard a rumor that somebody with the initials J I is gay too.  i wonder who he is.  hey dom kick that guy in the nuts.  wait... he may enjoy that.  nevermind.  plus i read your page.  dont you love the canadian government, they sure know how to spend our money.<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Hey I just want to get The Finger to a group of LAMEplayers who are crying abuot the calendar and calling it sexist.<br>
<br>
Me sexist, right.  Everyone is always saying i'm far too left wing, now i'm a right wing oppressor.<br>
<br>
If anyone is sexist it's people like a scrub named Chen who are paternalists.  Yeah, you heard me chump, paternalistic.  You think woman can't decide for themselves what they want to do?  Gee, thanks defender of the faith.  Maybe you can make women dress the way you think also.  Why don't you dress them in a burqua, then they'll have to listen to you.  YOU are the sexist.<br>
<br>
Guess, what dorks, it's America.  People are allowed to do and say and think what they want.  You should be thankful for that, cause that's the only way you get to spout your mangled, unintelligent tripe.<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>why do you have to go and say sexism is reserved by the right-wing oppressors? those who are truly right wing believe in individual freedoms.<br><br>take it back :)<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Many right winger certainly do respect individual freedoms.  Evan and I may not agree on health care, envt, or many other things, but he is a staunch defender of personal liberties.<hr>jason wade said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Neal. I love your ideas. They make decktech different from every other game commutity out there. But this idea is...well might be a little over the edge for a ccg gaming community. Granted that most ppl who play ccg are smart and responsable ppl and are of an older age. But I have recommended this site to many ppl including my friends who I play ccg's with that are under the age of 12. I am not say this is a bad idea. Just take a look at the picture before you put it up and make sure nobody would get the wrong impression about the picture and flame at decktech about it. Later decktech<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>I hear you Jason.  These pics aren't lewd or anything.  Just a smiling face of a girl from DT.  It's nothing raunchy<hr>John Anderson said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Have to jump in to defend the fellow "oppressors". Personal liberties are a big factor in my political philosphies. Sexism is not, just as Evan put it, "sexism is reserved by the right-wing oppressors". Anyway, Neal, did you see Frank Rich's latest Times Op column? Watch this: one of the few times I will agree to a slightly more left standpoint. Check it out in the link.<hr>Keith Watabayashi said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Sounds like fun, something different.I'll support it.<hr>Marc Urrutia said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>If the ladies are willing to submit photos, why not post em. <br>
<br>
Maybe we should ask them, what they would like to see?  Though I fear the answer would be Orlando Bloom!<hr>Lisa Gansky said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Haha...Lego's pretty cute, but I like Elrond better. ;)<br>

Dunno why...maybe I've just been seduced by his wisdom. :)<hr>John Rowe said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>Alright now, why has not anyone spoken up for the guys?  Why don't we put the whole "sexist" issue to rest by having DT Boys as well?  I, for one, would be willing to challenge any DT guy to a posedown or two!<hr>Hannah Grimm said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>Because no girl would want to see 6 loser guys.  The only cute gamer I know is austin.<br>
<br>
And, from a female.  this isn't sexist, get a life.<hr>John Rowe said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>WOAH!  No need to be insulting... notice that "sexist" is in quotations.  I don't think this endeavor is sexist at all.  Since that word had precedent however, I decided to use it.  But, as long as we are analzying verbage... are you insinuating that all DT guys are losers?  That would be awful hurtful.<hr>classified classified said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>You gotta be nuts to do that. If you ask me, the only way this would work is if oyu just use pictures from the cards. You people have got to be crazy to send in pictures of yourself! And being male, I'd even be expected to want ot see this!<hr>Neal Razi said on Sun Jun 2 2002 <br>Damina, kindly don't make yourself look retarded.  Hannah that was way out of line.  Behavior yourselves.<hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Sun Jun 2 2002 <br>Personally, I think it's a fabulous idea. There aren't very many female gamers out there (that aren't just chicks dragged to tournaments by their boyfriends). We all love playing games so why don't we add a little more of what we love to the gaming environment. =^_^= I'm all for it and I already sent a few old pictures to Alex. It's not sexist, and even if it was, it's volunteer only. *wink*<br>
<br>
Peace.<br>
Munchkin<br>
<br>
PS- Oh and Drake, Why would we want people not on DT to be the *DT* Calendar girl? In that case, we could just make a calendar of hot chicks and how original is that? =^_^=<hr>Damian Loback said on Sun Jun 2 2002 <br>Hello I am back agian and well my posts have be deleted. Well thats freedom of speach for you. Well i will not be silenced by this hitler run idea forcing us to look at women that make me want to puke. I hope that their are some hot women and not but ugly. Well I feel that we need some contrvesity up in here and yes i am the voice of the scrubs in swccg and i will keep it up to. I hate LOTR with a passion and hope it dies. Well i hope to see hot chick and not those fat ugly chicks that we see at the cons dressed up in chains and such that i laugh at a lot with my friends. and It feels so empty without me.  <br>
Peace <br>
Damian Loback<hr>John Anderson said on Sun Jun 2 2002 <br>Damian, are you hammered or something? Just kidding. LotR is not a bad game...I've bought two booster boxes and it can be entertaining. When you come over Friday I'll teach you how to play. No ugly chicks!!!!!<hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>I would take that as an insult but I can imagine you now choking on your words. I'm not a fat, ugly gamer chick thank you. =^_^=<br>

¤¤¤¤Munchkin¤¤¤¤<hr>Suann Robinson said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>Thanks for the compliment Tim!  You and Matt convinced me to hand over a couple pics, but ONLY to prove that not all girls who are into Dungeon and Dragons, LoTR, and PC gaming are bootang-looking!<hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>haha EXACTLY! Bust a cap for the non-"bootang-looking" gaming chicks! haha. =^_^=<br>
<br>
*The Dark Horse*<br>
¤¤¤¤Munchkin¤¤¤¤<hr>Patrick Napier said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>I think it is a great idea to get women involved more in DT.  I agree that the stereotypical gamer girl is more of a Cave Troll and not Arwen ( or more of a Yarna and not a Quenn Amidala, for you SW:CCG folks ).  But in all honesty, many of the girls who are into games are beautiful, intelligent women, and if they want to showcase themselves in good fun, I say let them.  Have fun people, relax.  If you dont want to look at the pics, you dont have to.  Goodnight and thank you. And trust me Damian, it really doesnt feel that empty without you.  So lets get down to Business, I don't got no time to play around, what is this?!?  Must be a circus in town, lets shut the S#@T down on these clowns, can I get a witness ? <br>
<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>Damian, i deleted your posts, cause you need to learn to watch your mouth.  You can have your say, but i'll delete things that are out of control, and i'll keep doing it.<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>damian, if you are an old skooler, then you should know i'll keep deleting you.  I told you, watch your mouth.  You wanna swear go to the SWCCG buzz board, looser standards there.  But like i said, if you've been around here, you should know i'll keep hitting you till you learn your lesson.<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>LOL...not a bad concept neal...no one can fault DT for not being original..<br>
<br>
should be interesting to see if there are any attractive card players out there :P all the gamer girls ive ever seen are 100% ugly in a bun.<br>
<br>
if i wanted to see attractive women, id go to a rave or something. DT calender chicks? its like digging for diamonds in a bauxite mine. still, ill be sure to check it out and see how it goes.<br>
<br>
respect,<hr>Myriam Gimaiel said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>why many guys think at the girls who play card are all ugly????? its not true... and its why i want to send my pic i want to proove u that a good looking girl can do so. :) <hr>Jeff Peck said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>damn i wanted to be the 69th person to post a messege, oh well, missed it by one place.  unless Neal deletes more things from that damian.  i never heard of the guy before.  who is he?  i can justify calling him a loser cant i Neal?  dude Neal is not a nazi.  Neal is a cool guy and respected by so many players around the world, he just doesnt put up with people that act like idiots, or people who bad mouth others.  and anybody who makes fun of others only does so because of some inadequacy about himself or herself.<hr>John Rowe said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>If I may chime in yet again, while hoping to avoid the obloquy of the more veteren members?<br>
Art imitates life.  Life is not all string bikinis and toned bodies.  I think it is mildly shallow and very superficial to claim that a DT calender should only contain startling DT beauties.  The gaming girls I have met are charming, unique individuals and if we are going to celebrate their participation, it should not be concomitant to a requirement of physical "beauty".  The calender is a great idea, but let's see it portray the reality of the gaming world, rather than a pubescent fantasy.<br>
<br>
Perhaps an esoteric observation not appropriate for this board... but, eh, I say what I say, right Damien?<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>why do guys think that girl gamers are ugly? cause....they generally are! i fully cannot recall a single gamer girl who has given me a trouser cramp. you wanna try, myriam, knock yourself out...hehe<br>
<br>
so, john...you wanna look at a calendar with 'inner beauty'? uh huh. i think some magazine did the same thing here in australia by putting a 65 yr old homosexual judge in their top 100 beautiful people issue...alongside people like nat portman, halle berry, etc. now, if you're telling me you'd pick up an issue of that mag for a picture of said judge, youve disturbed me highly.<br>
<br>
i got an idea...how about opening this thing to anyone...like...i dunno...'Scrub of the Month' or something. just get people to send in profiles and give em their 5 mins on the DT soapbox. what do you lot think?<br>
<br>
respect,<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>I think there's a lot of cute girl gamers.  I don't mind saying it, as long as no one gets bent over it.<br>
<br>
Dalantyr, Kim caton, MaryGail Dufresne, Hannah Grimm, like all of Mike Bellefatto's girlfriends, that one Asian YJ player who like half the people in orlando were following.  I've seen attractive girls at tournaments, and I'm no girlfriendless dork.  I'm sure there's more, esp since Lord of the Rings and MND have come online here.<br>
<br>
Here's what I'm saying.  This is not some PC thing where, haha, as HNS said with a 65 yro homosexual.  I'm not selling any illusions.  None of the girls pictured are going to be supermodels.  No kidding, I suppose that's not a shock.  Does that mean we wouldn't enjoy meeting them?  Does that mean that some of the guys wouldn't enjoy looking at them?  Or getting to know some fellow gamers?  It's just a chance to get to know some people here, and give the women a bit o' publicity.  You all know me, I love controversy.  Is this something Decipher would ever do?  Hell, no.  But it's just crazy enough and quirky enough for DT.<br>
<br>
Myriam, I'll write you.  The more the merrier.<br>
<br>
Oh and Damian you bought yourself a ban, enjoy.  I've met some retards on this site, but you are right up there.  Try to learn to SPELL words before using them, ok?<hr>Eivind Guneriussen said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>Ah, just for the record. Not all of the blokes playing cardgames etc.  are beautiful small elves eather. Ever seen a 200 pounds truckdriver in a dirty size small SW t-shirt. It is not  pritty.<br>
And by the way, not everybody here are american. Im norwegian. But anyway I were in the US once. And I did not see one single good looking chick. Then how can I even begin to hope for one who plays?<br>
Well well, I am looking forward anyway. But plz do not poste a pic that could scare Shelob in to a fit...<hr>Matt Berta said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>Gosh I love the bootang of gamer chicks... I can think of THREE that I've met, two of which I know personally who are MORE than attractive enough for this calendar! And one of them has already sent in pictures!<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>Guys one thing, cause i'm seeing hints of it: in the words of the immortal Gabe Alonso "Don't act like grubby gamers".  <br>
<br>
There's just a few of you who are acting really dorky right now.  For those of you who have had 0 luck with girls, a bit of advice.  Acting obxious is a very ineffective strategy.  Try being polite, it's a lot better strat, and a lot more pleasant.<hr>John Rowe said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>Hear, hear, Neal!<hr>Charlie Herren said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>Damian, go to school. Learn grammar and spelling. Quit typing like a retard.<br>
Buford, GA is ass.<br>
SWCCG isn't nearly what it used to be.<br>
This whole calendar idea came about because of LOTR and MND, and you're asking girls to play you in SWCCG, when in fact, before LOTR/MND, there weren't quite as many females posting to Decktech. I'm not quite following your logic.<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>"I think the furor is back".  Am i the only won that's notices the comic idiocy in that statement?<br>
<br>
Charlie do you know this geek?  What is he about 9 yrs old?  I thought you needed your daddy's permission to use the computer at that age?<hr>Charlie Herren said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>I don't recall the name from any local SWCCG tourneys I attended in the past couple of years, so I have no clue as to who this person is. Maybe he just started SWCCG when Coruscant came out or something..<hr>Chris Wodicka said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>I kinda know Damian from online. He hooked me up with some cards for regionals - he seemed like a nice guy. I think he just moved to GA from some other state, forgot which though. I don't really know him well enough to defend him though. <br>
<br>
I think the calendar is a cool idea. It gives us a look at the female gaming community. <hr>John Anderson said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>I know Damian pretty well, we test and go to tourneys together. I've been to his house once (DPC w/ Paul Myers and Jim) and he's been over to my place once and he's coming again Friday. My word's good, right Neal? Anyway, Damian moved here in July or so from Wisconsin. He's an all right guy, just a yankee (you know how those guys are). He can get a little fired up a bit, but when he's calm I think he's a pretty good member. As for his typing skills, he has dysographa (I believe I spelled that right) and that causes him to screw things up. As for his 'luck' with girls, he has a steady girlfriend, who is not quite as attractive as the girls I've dated, however, she seems attractive enough. He's been playing for a while and is all right (1600's?). I think he's either a junior or a senior in high school. Also, any SW GA players: tournament in Buford on the 8th. Be there. I think there'll be 10 or so. Charlie, Mike, Adam, I know y'all are playing LotR, but come out and play the game that you know that you came to love (even though D screwed it up at times. Operatives, anyone?!?)<hr>Megan McGinnis said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>I'm half annoyed, and half tempted by this whole thing.  hehe.  I'd be very interested in something like profiles with pictures in them, or a decktech member of the day photo or something that includes guys AND girls, but a calendar ... not to rain on the parade or anything, but I can't help but make bad connotations with the idea of a calendar.  It just smacks of objectification, though I know it's in good fun and I'm thinking of submitting anyway.  I'd be into a more level arena of sharing photos and having more participation than simply six chosen calendar girls.  Just my opinion, as a gal.   <hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>megan, you took the words outta my mouth.<br>
<br>
yeah, thats what i wanted to say. with the 'calendar' idea, people already have a mindset about what they wanna see in it...its like if you pick up playboy, you're gonna wanna see naked chicks, but if you pick up Scrye or Inquest or someting, you're not gonna have the same expectation. if it was a member of the month/day/year/century, it'd be all about people rather than a55. in the words of static x, more evil, less disco...if anyone understands that.<br>
<br>
respect,<hr>jason baretta said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>oh the contraversy, the debates are almost more fun than the damn project.<br>
and giles did you get my message?<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>which message, jason?<br>
and check out my member page and the 3rd link, man...this band kicks serious a55...logan mader 4 eva<br>
<br>
respect,<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>In the words of Han Solo, megan "Hey It's me" (pointing to myself with an innocent grin).  Would I do anything disrespectful?  You know me.<br>
<br>
I think you should send a photo Megan.  Get to know your fellow players.  Dispel any myths about there being no female gamers.  Or that the only ones are horrific monsters.  That's poppycock, and this calendar is gonna prove that.<br>
<br>
Besides it'll be fun.  Who doesn't want to be a star?<hr>Megan McGinnis said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>*does best impression of princess Leia frown at Han Solo*<br>

Hehe.  I might just send one in.  If I don't, I'll be sure to at least send YOU one.   *grin*  I think you should also have a men of decktech calendar, I think the male gamer stereotype is probably as much in need of shattering than the girl gamer one.  Maybe even MORE in need.  I'll help judge!  *waves hand in air*<br>
<br>
Really, though.  Still digging the intent, but not digging the delivery.<hr>Megan McGinnis said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>*looks down at date*<br>

Is it tomorrow already?  <hr>Jeff Peck said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>WOOOHOOO damian is banned.  <hr>Charlie Herren said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>I have sold about 2/3 of my good SWCCG cards. I haven't bought anything since Tatooine. My last major tournament for SWCCG was the first Atlanta DPC. After that tournament, my will to play SWCCG was just gone. You won't see me playing SWCCG much, if at all anymore.<br>

<hr>Marc Urrutia said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>Ya know, that is an interesting point.  The male geek gamer stereo type could stand to be shattered.  Perhaps that should be considered.  <br>

You already had me saying yes...<hr>will gilchrist said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Hey, Damian is an idiot but I'm allowed to say that cuz I'm his bud.  John's right, he has dysgraphia or something wack like that and it makes him even more retarded than he already is, but if you get to know him, he's alright.  Charlie: I vaguely know you from SWCCG days but I'm doubtful of your success with the ladies, so take it easy.  Damian:shut up dude quit looking like a moron (aka don't talk) give neal a break he seems like a good level headed guy and works hard to maintain a great site.  DT ladies- if you want to dispel any myths about gamer girls, then post ur pics so we can be the judge, and neal, if you want to do the same thing with guys to be fair to the girls, then maybe that'll smooth over some feelings.  Whatever, peace.<hr>Charlie Herren said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Hmm, interesting. <br>
Will: reread what I originally posted, and the posts I've made on this thread, which actually have nothing to do with "success with the ladies." But I guess since I've been worrying about other (and more important) things, like school and my job, I guess that makes me a failure..<br>
<br>
As for a male version of the calendar.. one request, two words: Mike Kessling.<hr>will gilchrist said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Actually Charlie, I did read your posts, but I was just making an underhanded personal attack in defense of Damian Lowjack.  However, upon talking to him over AIM, I remember that he is a dufus and that he deserves no defense (I luv u damian).  I work nearly full time (but am taking the summer off of school) but I make the little lady a fairly high priority, but maybe thats just me.  Anyway, wouldn't there be some kind of legal problems with having Mike on the calendar? Other than that, he is kinda cute... <hr>Douglas Camp said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Here's a thought. Since the Queen of England is a fan of Decktech, why not honor her by adding her to the calendar? Sure she's old, but think about this: it could raise awareness of Decktech throughout the world. Just a thought I had.<hr>Charlie Herren said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Saying Mike Kessling is "kinda cute" is like saying Michael Jordan was a decent basketball player. I don't know the exact legalities of posting pictures of an 8-year-old boy on the internet, but I suppose if Mike isn't in a compromising pose, then it should be alright.<hr>Charlie Herren said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Oh, and as a side note, 2nd-shift jobs suck ass.<hr>John Rowe said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>I would like to second the motion for a guys calender.  Even if no girls are interested, it would at least go a little toward gender neutrality.<hr>will gilchrist said on Thu Jun 6 2002 <br>So, whaddya say Neal/Alex?  Maybe after you finish up the ladies calendar, we could consider a guys calendar.  We have already nominated Mike, and I am considered something of a stud-muffin by the ladies and would be willing to send in a pic.  I'm sure that some of the more gender neutrality minded fellas wouldn't mind leveling out things for the girls by posting some pics.  The last thing I want to see is DT becoming hotorsnot.com, but I think it would be kinda fun to give the females a fair turn and something to bring the male/female gaming community closer--and I mean that in the best possible way.<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Jun 6 2002 <br>Hmm, tell you what, i'll consider it... thing is i think there'd be TOO many submissions for that.<hr>Munchkin Chiknas said on Thu Jun 6 2002 <br>It is completely legal to have pictures of Mikey on a calendar as long as you can't see his no-no special spots. =^_^= Rather than a male DT Calendar, we should just have a Mikey Kessling calendar. I would take the responsibility upon myself to take some barely legal Mikey pictures. hehe.<br>
<br>
Oh and btw, John Anderson, the Atlanta crew (Mike, Charlie, etc) won't be able to make it on the 8th in Buford due to the fact that we'll be in South Carolina at the LOTR Territorial. Ü<br>

Peace.<br>

Don't tempt me, i might just hook it up!<hr>Haakon Neinhalt-Schmutzig said on Fri Jun 7 2002 <br>as long as DT doesnt turn into a animal S&M lesbian barely legal fetish site, ill still keep coming here :P<br>

(actually, even then id still keep coming, only if the articles are good...hehe)<br>

respect,<hr>Adam Drake said on Sat Jun 8 2002 <br>A couple of things...<br>
<br>
First of all Buford GA sucks @ss...<br>
<br>
Munchkin may not be a fat ugly gaming chick, but she is pretty annoying sometimes, but she's not the worst gaming groupie I have ever met.<br>
<br>
I think the fact that this has created such a furor is hilarious. <br>
<br>
Mike kessling is a cute 8 year old boy, but don't insult him in public... EVER.<br>
<br>
Peace.
