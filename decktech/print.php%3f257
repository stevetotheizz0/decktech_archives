Now what this means I have no clue.  I'm sure it's some sort of typo, but it is kinda funny.<hr>Neal Razi said on Fri Oct 25 2002 <br>Straight man?  Uh, you guys never heard of a straight man in comedy?  Abbot in Abbot and Costello, Stan Laurel in Laurel and Hardy.  Steve Martin in Planes, Trains and Automobiles to John Candy's.  In comedy teams you have a straight man and a wacky guy.  The wacky guy does the bumbling foolishness and the straight man reacts to it.  They are usually the smart one in the team.<br>
<br>
I forgot the audience I was writing to here, bunch of goodballs.  I can only imagine if i said "Brian's has at his disposal an amazing tool".<hr>Adam Cregeur said on Sat Oct 26 2002 <br>Huh Huh... He said Tool...<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry I couldn't resist<hr>Eric Hunter said on Sat Oct 26 2002 <br>What is this tall business? 6'2 isn't tall. i worked hard for my discriminatingly tall frame. but then to hear some body being called tall at only 6'2! THIS IS OUTRAGOUES!<br><br>
<br><br>
well i just wanted to say that this decktech player of the year thing is a little premature as worlds is now in 5 days and some other people could win it then have a bigger and better 2002 winning package.<br><br>
that is all<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
note: all misspellings and grammatical errors have been inspired by early prose and poems where imperfection always had a place. please also note that i continue to carry on these imperfections in most of my decktech contributions, mainly cause word anoyys me.<hr>Neal Razi said on Sat Oct 26 2002 <br>You are a retard.  What the hell does deciphercon have to do with the DT player of the year?  DT gives a shyte about who wins the Decipher world championship.  In case you haven't noticed<br>
<br>
WE ARE DIFFERENT COMPANIES<br>
<br>
Decipher makes a total of ONE game on this site.  They don't even make star wars anymore (and i don't count trek because like 5 people in the world play it).<br>
<br>
Hayes won a big fat 0 at DT events.  Maybe he can be Decipher player of the year, but he has 0% claim on DT player of the year, buddy.  And so do you.<hr>Eric Hunter said on Sat Oct 26 2002 <br>wow don't spaz out neal. but next time if u want it to be a pure decktech player of the year of the world thing then don't go saying he won denver open or keeps a high rating cause last time i checked those don't belong to decktech or are run by decktech. and whaddup w/ u sayin i have 0% claim and calling me a retard, i'm just poking some fun at the decktech player award and u get all angry at me :(<br>
<br><br>
that's just not nice.<hr>Hayes Hunter said on Sun Oct 27 2002 <br>This is such bullshyte.  What do you think you're doing calling my brother a retard?  You criticize people for name-calling, scream when it's directed and you, and yet here you are doing it yourself, totally unprovoked.<br>
Not once did you declare any sort criteria for determining the player of the year.  As my brother pointed out, the fact that you listed non-DT events along with his accomplishments suggests that you did not base your decision solely on DT events.  We all understand that you and Decipher are separate entities, but if you're going to make such a big deal about how Wars isn't their game, then there is no reason why you shouldn't take into account who wins Worlds this year. <br>
And whoever said that I, or my brother for that matter, should be DT player of the year?<hr>Michael Pistone said on Sun Oct 27 2002 <br>I have to agree that was a completely unprovoked attack on Eric.  The name calling was very unnecessary.  He was just expressing his opinion and he has every right to do that.  How old are you dude, seriously.  You're throwing out name calling and insults to a teenager who plays cards and was expressing his opinion, the least you could have done was just expressed your opinion like a civil person.<hr>Neal Razi said on Sun Oct 27 2002 <br>I stand by my opinion, E.Hunter was being retarded.  His claim made no sense, and i'll repeat it here<br>
<br>
<b>well i just wanted to say that this decktech player of the year thing is a little premature as worlds is now in 5 days and some other people could win it then have a bigger and better 2002 winning package.</b><br>
<br>
I repeat that DecipherCon has nothing to do with anything around here.  I'm sure whoever wins it deserves a lot of respect, but it doesn't have a goddam thing to do with DT.  <br>
<br>
He can make fun of the DT player of the year all he wants.  That's his opinion, and my opinion is that his opinion is retarded.  And Hayes if you think the Winner of <b>Decipher</b>Con has anything to do with the <b>DeckTech</b> Player of the year, as you seem to indicate, then you must be retarded as well.  Here's a hint: look at the words in bold.<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, I'm concluding you are retarded Hayes.  Uh, "<b>Not once did you declare any sort (of - sic) criteria for determining the player of the year</b>"??  Uh, yes, i did.  It was the person who won the most at DPC events.  Or did you miss that?  Guess you did.  Guess you missed the poll for like a month too.<br>
<br>
Hayes, furthermore, you and your brother can "Hysterically laugh" as you state all you want.  You both won jack at DPC events.  You won nothing, and Brian won every event.  Taking away from Brian's accomplishments, just because you don't like him, is ridiculous.  Give the guy some props, you two sore losers.  I'm sure if you beat him at DecipherCon, he'd give you yours.<br>
<br>
Pistone - blow me.<hr>Neal Razi said on Sun Oct 27 2002 <br>Here's the link for the impaired brothers who claim i didn't post any criteria<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.decktech.net/index.php?artc=257">http://www.decktech.net/index.php?artc=257</a><hr>Eric Hunter said on Sun Oct 27 2002 <br>neal you continue to impress me, not only do you try to belittle teenagers(who haven't even stooped to your level and call you names), but now you accuse us of being impaired then giving a link to the very page i'm already on. maybe you had problems reading what i wrote(was i to subtle for ya?) but i stated that you had a ton of fun boasting that he did well at non DT events.<br><br>
oh yeah neal, not only have i not attended any DT run events this year, but my brother and i have made no claim to this 'coveted' title. <br><br>
and one last thing, though this is contradicting what i wrote earlier but i got to stoop to what you have been doing. if u don't agree w/ anything i just wrote neal then your retarted.(wow neal, opinions are easy to make and name calling is just as fun!)<hr>Neal Razi said on Sun Oct 27 2002 <br>I'll admit a little retardation in pointing to that link, try<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.decktech.net/index.php?artc=233">http://www.decktech.net/index.php?artc=257</a><br>
<br>
By the way, give me a break.  I'm sure you were real offended i called you retarded.  I could care less if you call me that.  Oooh, a retard, harsh.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, just because you're a teenager doesn't mean i'm going to cut you slack.  You two are more than old enough to account for your actions.  You were acting like a jerk, so was hayes.  I hate sore losers.  You don't like Brian, too bad for you.  Don't take it out on me, i'm doing something cool giving out an award, and you chumps are like making fun of it.  Quit being petty.<br>
<br>
I was giving his resume, not boasting and giving him well deserved props.  You are trying to take that away from him and i don't appreciate that.  Therefore, i ripped into you, and will continue to do so if you keep acting retarded, and trying to put down my friends accomplishments.  Hayes by the way you want to hear hysterical laughter?  That's me watching you mangle logic and reason.<hr>Robert dayton said on Mon Oct 28 2002 <br>im hayes's freind IRL, and i agree with neal that hayes doesnt like brian and is just cocky, but neal there is something to be said about loosing your cool when you are representing DT. i dont even know eric. i think he gave me a bad review on a TR, but still you could have made your point more eloquently by not resorting to name-calling even though/if eric was allegedly retarded or not.<br>
anyways, just my .02<br>
BARICH!<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Oct 28 2002 <br>no problem barich, it's good to see you again.<br>
<br>
I'm not losing my cool, i'm just calling these two out, so to speak.  We know why they are making fun of the DT player of the year, it's cause they are jealous.  I lost a lot of respect when they went for the "hurt teenager" angle.  Hell, some of my best friends are teenagers, i don't hold back on them at all.  They can give it out, but then cry when they get it back, that's wack<hr>Hayes Hunter said on Mon Oct 28 2002 <br>Wow.  <br>
<br>
"I'm not losing my cool..."<br>
<br>
"... they are making fun of the DT player of the year... [be]cause they are jealous."<br>
<br>
If you honestly believe those statements are true, Neal, then it is my 'opinion' that you are retarded.<br>
<br>
Look at this thread Neal; you're the only one getting upset here.  Additionally, neither my brother nor I ever made fun of the DT POTY program, calling it stupid or worthless or anything like that.  And how could you think that either of us (or anyone, for that matter) could be jealous of Hunter (especially over him getting a Rook Endura)?<br>
<br>
But that's really not the issue here.  Robert is right.  You could have made your point to my brother differently, considering you represent DT.  There was no need for you to come down on him.<hr>William Diniega said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>Funny thread.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>hayes, quit being a wuss.  I'm not getting upset, i'm giving you both back the crap you so rightly deserve.  let me tell you two kids something... you aren't lawyers, and this isn't court.  Talking about reps of DT and how i hurt a poor teenagers feelings... give me a break, you sounds like a bunch of wimpy old men.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking i should have came down on the both of you harded.  Learned you one southern style.  You guys were acting like tools and got what you deserved.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>err, hrm, that would be the word harder, not harded.  oh and click on the link anyway, it's article 233 i just didn't copy it right, but it works.<hr>Hayes Hunter said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>Gee golly Neal, you learned us good, hyuck.  <br>
<br>
And what exactly does being a wuss entail?  You attacked my bro, I stood up for him, and you called us both retards.  That makes me a wuss?  I don't see either of us crying (quite the contrary this thread has been quite amusing), all I see is you pulling another one of your hissy fits.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>Hayes, I see you are trying to provoke me.  I restate<br>
<br>
1) you and your brother are a little slow<br>
2) I'm not upset, i keep stating this, i just think you are thus above, and think you can dish it out, but not take it.  I gave you two exactly what you deserved, and I'll do it again.<br>
3) You are completely a wuss trying to say things like "You are a rep of DT" or "You big meanie, that's a defenseless teenager".  That last is the lamest, like teenagers don't bust on and be busted on.  P - athetic<br>
4) You stuck your weenie nose in where it didn't belong, between me and your brother.<br>
5) You two coochies were ragging on the DT player of the year out of *jealousy*.  Pretty sad.  Win some money at DT events first.<br>
<br>
Here's a clue for you - when you try to sound smart, you sound really dumb.  That's the amusing thing on this thread, watching the flood of illogic and lack of reason that comes out of your mouth.<br>
<br>
Now be a man, and step up to the plate, and quit hiding behind "hissie fits", "good corporate representation" and whatever outs you can come up with.  You were <b>Jealous</b> of Brian, you and your brother, and were both trying to put him and DT down.  I'm calling you out, boss, let's see what you got.<hr>Michael Hawley said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>Newsflash: Brian Hunter's DT Player of the Year award revoked! Minimum height requirement violation given as possible cause. "I demand a recount!" says Manute Bol. <br>
<br>
In a related story, the Decktech webmasters lose their jobs. "Poor corporate representation" is cited. "I can't help it." said Neal Razi. "I just lost my cool and fired myself." <br>
<br>
The Hunter brothers are reported to be considering a hostile takeover. "We know we're tall enough but we're afraid Neal will call us mean names..."<br>
<br>
The ensuing "hissie fit" resulted in multiple lacerated feelings and ego fractures. Fortunately, a quick-thinking bystander was able to dial 9-wah-wah<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>Michael Hawley said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>Just teasing guys! And congratulations to Brian Hunter. It was very nice to meet you at F-Con.  <hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>Funny stuff.  I remember Manute, he was cool.  He was this 7 foot 8 or something string bean.  They had him and mugsy bouges on the same team.<br>
<br>
I'm having fun with this, I'm laughing hysterically at Hayes illogical responses and rason dé bizarrerie.  I'm far from mad as i have stated umpteen times.<hr>Michael Hawley said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>"We're all mad here." the Cheshire Cat :-)<hr>William Diniega said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>I dont know, neal, you seem pretty mad because you keep posting the same things over and over, if you didnt care that much about this, you wouldnt be postint he same things over and over and over.<hr>William Diniega said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>oh, and congrats to Brian, he definitely deserved all the money he won.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>It's called debating,  twerp.  I'm refuting his points, have you heard of this activitity.  Incidentally you are BANNED for spamming AGAIN!  Go away, spammer.<hr>William Diniega said on Tue Oct 29 2002 <br>this spaming wouldnt happen to be the stuff done by JimCarrey would it? Because I can assure that it wasn't me, but a person named John Graham that goes to my school, if you think hes fake, go and check out the decipher ratings. But I assure you that it was not me. Well, Ill let you go back to your "debating."<hr>Eric Hunter said on Wed Oct 30 2002 <br>neal i really haven't felt u have refuked an of my points.infact i just feel like you have mae yourself look like an idiot through out the thread. our lack of perception and ability to make valid points has been amusing. but i'm bored now, and quite frankly, it's not worth my time. <br><br>
this is my last post.<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Oct 30 2002 <br>I cannot make anything out of that above statement.  If that's your last on the topic it's probably good.<br>
<br>
Ok, i'll lay off you Hunters then.  But just remember, you started crap here, and when you start acting annoying, I'm gonna give it back to you.  Hayes is generally an ok guy, but he has a tendency to get squirrely now and again.  If someone starts stuff with me, just expect a "refuke"<br>
