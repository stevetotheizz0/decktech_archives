Edmund Gray<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Wed Jan 30 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>This will be wrapping up soon, and then the US nominations will begin, so get started quickly.<hr>Ryan Austin said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>I nominate:<br>
Bastian Winklehaus <br>
Gary Carman <br>
<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>They are already on, and already in as world champions<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>I nominate myself. I am from Botswana and I won our villages championship the past 6 years in a row using the same Jawa decks, light and dark, that I have owned since premiere. I have not bought any cards since but no one can ever beat me. Please include me.<hr>Andy Klema said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>I would like to nominate Alex Tennet. I'm not sure where we stand on how many people will get in and for what exactly, but aside from being an excellent player, Alex is one of the more intelligent, out-spoken people in this game, and he's long been the voice of reason in many a conflict. He's got my vote.<hr>Keith Watabayashi said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>Rallops creator-Martin Akesson, no doubt about it.<hr>edmund gray said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>please read the list first, many of your nominations are already on there. also, if you name someone please list why (i.e. major tournaments they've won, world's they've qualified for, decks they've made, high rating they've maintained for so long, etc.), thanks.<hr>Joe Olson said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>Definantly Tennet, excellent player, would be one of the highest rated players in the UK if ratings were correct, not to mention an excellent deckbuilder (anyone remember "Dark Surgeon", the dark side deck rated highest on decktech, won something like 9 state championships, etc.?)<br>
<br>
Yeah, I'd say Tennet.<hr>Jamie Giberti said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>I'd like to nominate 3 of my fellow brits, firstly Alex Tennet for his deckbuilding and manip skills, and for the monster that is dark surgeon. 2nd, gary carman for being quite possibly the coolest CCG player ever, nicer guy you wont meet, and of course for being an ex world champ. And 3rd'ly Peter Di Biasio for being in and around the worlds top20 for a few years, UK national champ last year, and for consistently running tourneys, and generally helping the SW community here.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents.<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>I only cursorily glanced at the nominations as I posted them.  I nominate Alex as well, an outstanding deck builder, winner of opens.<hr>Hayes Hunter said on Wed Jan 30 2002 <br>aye, alex.  great player and , as jamie mentioned, if the ratings weren't retarded he'd easily be in the top 3 of the UK.  he's won plenty of big events there.  great deckbuilder and star wars personality.  he deserves to be up there.<hr>Matt Lush said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>I firmly believe this should NOT be a "political" or "popularity" contest, but Alex certainly deserves to be on the list. I'll second or sixth or seventh his nomination here not because he's my friend but because of the previously mentioned Dark Surgeon deck of his, and his numerous accomplishments and skill as a player. <hr>Ciaron C said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>I'd like to nominate Preston Hunt, he is a phemonenal player and a superb deck builder. He has "broken" more cards than anyone else that I know of and used to have one of the highest ratings in Canada.  <hr>jason baretta said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br> hey all. i'd like to nominate Clarrie Brown. firstly, theres no one representing NSW Aus. in your line up. Hes currently one of the highest ranked Aus. players (check the ratings) and pretty much has owned us all in just about every tournement hes been to in Aus. and besides ppl. like Josem have not played the game in ages and if our rankings from 'down under' every got changed regularly i think they'd be a totally different top 3 in Aus. <hr>edmund gray said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>to be nominated, a person needs to be more than just dominate in their local region.<hr>jason baretta said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>oh yeah and hes state champion<hr>jason baretta said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>"a person needs to be more than just dominate in their local region." well terry lyons and Josem are hardy world champions are they, only Jones has performed on worlds. you may have a point, but if so, these guys have no place in a 'Hall of fame'<hr>Haakon Geburtstag said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>if someone else from oz should go up, it should be luca. props to my nigga. who else has the ballz to play a Pile/Podracer? hehehe<br>
<br>
stuart jones roxors. go jonesy.<br>
<br>
terry is a ripoff merchant, and josem is a young liberal c0cksucka.<hr>Haakon Geburtstag said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>if someone else from oz should go up, it should be luca. props to my nigga. who else has the ballz to play a Pile/Podracer? hehehe<br>
<br>
stuart jones roxors. go jonesy.<br>
<br>
terry is a ripoff merchant, and josem is a young liberal c0cksucka.<hr>Wizard 923 said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>I havent played in Vic for ages, but Terry should not be in that list for the same reason Kevin should'nt.. <br><br>
And Stuart and Josem havent played in ages, and ages. The only time josem shows up anymore is to sell cards..<br><br>
I say the Legends board just should'nt be for dominators of the game (or you would only have Victorians from Aus in there) it should also included the main stayers and the overall Champions of Variaty, Longevity and Sportsmanship.. and Luca is the only player that matches all of that :-)<hr>edmund gray said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>i was under the impression that stuart jones was top 12 at worlds twice, please correct me if i'm wrong. and jos at least once. clint hays made the list, cause i'm just a scrub and don't know anything, so i'm sure he'll be here soon to defend why he picked jos and jones.<hr>edmund gray said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>also, this hall of fame is not meant to insult anyone who isn't in or nominated. just because you don't get in, or nominated, does not mean your not a great swccg player/contributor.<hr>Steve Marshall said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>This is a very cool idea. Congrats to everyone who gets in or nominated!<hr>Michael Hawley said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>Just cause a player has not been active for a while does not mean he does not merit a spot. Just cause a player happens to be at the top of his game right now, does not mean that he does merit a spot. Jones has performed very well at worlds. Josem has been a dominant figure as well and a voice of the game. Whether they actually get into the Hall will be for the voters to decide. We are trying to take the long view here and are trying to give preference to career value over peak value in most cases. <hr>Markus Wuest said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>Alex should be in there, mos def!<hr>Spencer Ball said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>i nominate Spencer Ball<hr>Spencer Ball said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>i second that nomination for Spencer Ball. He has won 2 tournaments and never placed in a negative differential. he has the highest rating percentage per games played in the world.<hr>Spencer Ball said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>no this is not spencer ball again, decktech is just having some technical difficulties. spencer ball for the non-us hall of fame!<hr>Robert Werbicki said on Thu Jan 31 2002 <br>Alex Tennet and Julien Riviere<hr>Fred Durst said on Fri Feb 1 2002 <br>Cruger Dunn-Flanagan should b in. nuf said.<hr>Luca Costanzo said on Fri Feb 1 2002 <br>About the Australian players:<br>
<br>
Stuart Jones- top 12 in worlds three times.  'nuff said.<br>
<br>
Josem-  Consistent top player back in the day.  Cursed to come second at all world qualifying events until, one fateful day, he won a bye into day 2 and subsequently scrubbed out.  Also contributed a lot to the general SW community, but quit around DSII.<br>
<br>
Terry Lyons- Doesn't play much.  Yes, he did represent Aus at the "Operatives Tournament" aka worlds 98 (I think that was the year).  Runs a tournament every month or so here.<br>
<br>
I think that Joz and Jonesy are justified, but unless hall of fame is broadened to mean anything to do with the game (which would result in a heck of a long list), Terry probably shouldn't be in it.<br>
<br>
I think that Julian Riviere should be on the list.  <br>
<br>
Adam Amy is an Australian who is also deserving.  Adam has played the game since day 1 and consistently placed highly.  He playtests/has playtested with Jones, Joz and myself, which helps to explain the fact that he hasn't gone to a worlds (as Stu kept on winning the continentals/states!).  He finally won continentals this year and we were all extatic ... then D cancelled worlds and refused to pay Adam's airfare to freedomcon, and so he lost his big chance.<hr>Haakon Geburtstag said on Fri Feb 1 2002 <br>i second luca's vote for adam. he's a dude, his house was a mecca for swccg before he got ejected, with all the best vic players attending thursday night playtest sessions. plus he let me bum about a pack's worth of smokes from him, and he's always been there for scrub players like me, helping tweak deck ideas, and saying 'this sucks' when i got some dumb idea into my head.<br>
<br>
as luca said, adz finally qualified in 2001 for worlds with the fall of jones cause of the infamous YCHF/insight mixup, and missed his shot at proving his worth...for all the good times, and for being an all round good player and absolute dude, i say adz should go on that hall of fame.<br>
<br>
respect.<hr>Lyle Waldman said on Fri Feb 1 2002 <br>Anyone who can win with a Premiere-only Jawa deck deserves to be on the list.  I nominate Mike Blumberg.<hr>edmund gray said on Fri Feb 1 2002 <br>i'm sure adam is a great guy, and a great player, but there are probably hundrends of players like that who if circumstances were different would have been recognized as top players...unfortunatley we can't do that, or at least that's not what were aiming for.<hr>Joshua Grancell said on Fri Feb 1 2002 <br>I nominate Joshua Grancell, for holding the NJ SWCCG Pro Tour, and for trying to bring back the game in New Jersey. Go Josh!!!<hr>Joshua Grancell said on Fri Feb 1 2002 <br>...<hr>edmund gray said on Fri Feb 1 2002 <br>there will be a second non-player, but contributor section of the hall of fame, maybe Joshua can be nominated for that.<hr>Haakon Geburtstag said on Fri Feb 1 2002 <br>question: why is juz on the non-US list? isnt he a US resident now?<br>
<br>
are we basically narrowing the hall of fame to anyone who qualified for worlds at least once?<hr>edmund gray said on Fri Feb 1 2002 <br>juz is inteded to be included in the second part of the hall of fame for those that have contributed/changed the game, not as a player.<br><br>pretty much all nominees must have done well at least once at world or at several other interanational cons like gencon.<hr>Steve Hennel said on Sat Feb 2 2002 <br>A list should be made up by more than a couple of people. Maybe you should talk to the Players' Committee about any kind of Hall of Fame. Asking Clint Hays to do it alone is not just stupid, but doesn't accurately represent the views of the entire playing community.<hr>edmund gray said on Sat Feb 2 2002 <br>it's not just clint hays, michael hawely, me, and neal have all helped out and that's why were asking for suggestions, and i know for a fact that i will not work with the player's committee. we have tried getting decipher to help, but all they'll do is put up the names of the inductees.<hr>jason baretta said on Sat Feb 2 2002 <br>i wish i was as cool as edmund gray  <hr>Fernando Medalón said on Sun Feb 3 2002 <br>No Spanish players?<br>
Nominate: Pedro Guzman, Jose Pedro Sanchez and me.<hr>Fernando Medalón said on Sun Feb 3 2002 <br>Also Lautaro Leiva and both Mario and Miguel Tarin (cool players).<hr>edmund gray said on Sun Feb 3 2002 <br>the hall of fame is not set up to honor a certain amount of players from a certain reagion.<hr>Rodney Lee said on Mon Feb 4 2002 <br>I nominate Phil McCraken, the greatest Scotish player to play the game!<hr>Haakon Geburtstag said on Mon Feb 4 2002 <br>hey rod, ure so funny!!!!!!!!!!!! :)<br>
<br>
i nominate rodney lee, the guy who only wins when he can place your emperor out of play!<hr>Haakon Geburtstag said on Mon Feb 4 2002 <br>oh rod, ure so funny!!!<br>
<br>
i nominate rodney lee, the scrub who only wins when you show him your hidden base!<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Feb 4 2002 <br>Get the player's committee to help?  The player's committee consists of one great player, another very good player and a bunch of political choices that don't even play the game.<hr>edmund gray said on Mon Feb 4 2002 <br>dude, eric olson is a very good player too, he's done a lot for the game, and is by no means a blind-decipher-loving fool.<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Feb 4 2002 <br>John is the great player, eric is the very good player.  Girard was good, but he doesn't even play anymore, he's doing reports on Magic and playing Magic.  How much is he going to be interested?  I imagine he was selected for his involment in the DPC, hence I put him in the political category<hr>edmund gray said on Tue Feb 5 2002 <br>oh, i had assumed you had girard as the very good player, sorry.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Feb 5 2002 <br>Don't mind me, I'm just grumpy that they left old David Akers off the player's committee.  You'd think running the most successful SW tournament series ever would count for something.  <br>
<BR><BR>The way I see it we've got ONE chance to get this right, and the first players committee is absolutely critical.  I'm just not real happy with some of the selections, it seem that some of them were picked for political reasons more than anything.  Thank God John Arendt is on it though.  Three of those guys don't even play at all, they just are Decipher friendly.  I'd have picked differently and included Jim Colson as the main Decipher guy.  Jim Colson is one the best SM's of all time, pro-decipher but pro-player.  Well, we'll see what happens.<hr>edmund gray said on Tue Feb 5 2002 <br>eric's one of the best sm of all time too, granted i've never been any where else but he's been running a tournament every month for something like 4 years, coming to various stores on game nights, letting me and the little kids rip him off in trades, lets us borrow cards, and always answers ruling questions promptly and correctly. i agree that there is only one chance to get it right...but giving it to gpn makes it a sure failure, and to be honest i'm kinda glad, unless they ban shields, epp qui-gon and maul, and racing then i'd be thrilled.<hr>Hayes Hunter said on Tue Feb 5 2002 <br>dude... collectively the PC is a great group... <b>HUGE</b> frickin announcements coming tomorrow (or is it today?) regarding the <b>FUTURE</b> of wars.  no shiet.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Feb 5 2002 <br>we'll see, i'm skeptical of the PlayersComm, but that's just me.<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Tue Feb 5 2002 <br>neal, i hear you. but to be honest - I was shocked they picked as many pro-decktech guys as they did. now granted they snubbed decktech where it really counts and that will hurt them. i hope that something happens to breath some life into the game.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Feb 5 2002 <br>Pro-DeckTech at this point is the great John Arendt.  Mike Girard jumped ship silently earlier this year, and Greg Anderson and Joe Helfrich have historically been two of the most vocal opponents against DeckTech.  Doug Taylor was on the buzz board about a week ago saying anyone who wanted a SW Hall of Fame as voted on by the players here was a psychotic.  Now you see why I'm skeptical.  There's always this senitment  that our players are fringe element wackos rather than the real players who play the game.<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Tue Feb 5 2002 <br>I put John, Mike, and Eric in pro-decktech...i guess i was wrong - damn!<hr>Michael Hawley said on Tue Feb 5 2002 <br>Neal, I am a avid DT supporter but you only have to go look at the Buzz board to see why people think that DT members are "fringe element wackos." I'm all for freedom of speech. But with rumors like "Who's the coolest player?" and "Episode 1 cards are gay." and name calling matches in other threads, observers could be forgiven for thinking that less savory elements dominate here. <br><br> <hr>Hayes Hunter said on Tue Feb 5 2002 <br>actions speak louder than words.  todays announcement was fantastic, and there are more on the way.  anti decktech or not, these guys are getting it done for the players.<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Feb 6 2002 <br>Well, behind fine gentlemen edmund and rayc's urging, I'll just reserve judgment for now.  But I'm still skeptical.  Hayes, you make no sense though with your statement "Action speak louder than words".  What is that supposed to mean?<hr>edmund gray said on Wed Feb 6 2002 <br>yeah, especially considering all d gives us is words and no actions, i hope they prove me wrong, but they haven't so...<hr>Chris Moore said on Wed Feb 6 2002 <br>If there is any one player from the UK that should be nominated, it is Peter di Biasio.  He's been the UK number 1 for ages, he won the Worlds wild card in 2000 and he's finished 2nd and 3rd in the European Championship.  If you need an example of "actions speak louder than words", then there you go.<hr>edmund gray said on Wed Feb 6 2002 <br>the actions speak louder than words has nothing to do with the hall of fame. peter and alex are being nominated.<hr>Juz Pakes said on Thu Feb 7 2002 <br>I think it was Monty Python who said "It's an honour to be nominated with all these other losers". But seriously, I am humbled to be in the company of so many of the games major players, and indeed to have met nearly all of them personally.<br>
<br>
To address a couple of comments above:<br>
(a) Terry Lyons should be there. Not only a multiple WC Qualifier (he was one of the first WCQ reps from Oz), but also has done so much to promote and run the game in Australia. Kevin Ch'ng deserves nomination for the same reason - he made the first Worlds, and many other players (Jones, Josem, Luca) would not be where they are without his constant event coordination.<br>
<br>
I had more to say, but time gets away from me! <br>
<br>
SWCCG Lives Forever, even if one day it will only in my memory.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Juz<br>
<hr>Luca Costanzo said on Mon Feb 11 2002 <br>Thanks, Juz, I stand corrected.  I didn't know Terry qualified multiple times.<br>
<br>
I think that the big problem here is that we don't have a set of criteria.  Maybe we should vote on that first?
