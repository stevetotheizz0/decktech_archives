With planet subjugation, you are able to choose when and how to get the right destiny.  The Dark Path can be used better than electrobinocs in the right hands too. Now, of course I agree with many of the other reviews and their advice, but no deck is 100%.  It there was one, then this game would get old very quickly.

Only best decks will beat it. (four stars) <p>First, i want to say, i really, really like the originality of this deck.  Even if no one ever plays this deck, the idea alone is worth a good rating.  The tech in this deck is simply amazing.  ig-88 and ESPECIALLY Bossk with gun plus tie bombers is just brilliant.  I like the fact that you can overload or capture your opponents key charcters, then slam down on him for massive battle damage on a destiny drawless chump as well by drawing tie bombers for 5 destiny.  If the opponent is not playing sense and alter, you'll be in great shape.  Very good drain systems, and good power with all power to weapons+dreadnaught.  And i like the DS start, strong, no revolutions against that sucker.  That being said though, i don't think i could play this without becoming a nervous wreck.  I could just envision the guy dropping down obi at the hut and altering well guarded first turn(he's going first).  that alone would drive me crazy, i could just see the grimtaashes coming.  if he gets the jump on you that way, he could very well sense or alter everything until there is no try came down, including if he chases you out of there even for a minute with the falcon, sfs, then you'd be dead.  Granted M&T+Sense/alter+grimtaashes+falcon is not the most popular deck right now, but that is one deck type i don't like being weak against, it just is too good, it's an oldie but a greaty.  A lot of people, me included still play captain han, there is no overloading him.  Landing claw could be another annoyance.  One other worry i have is that you have to pull all those bombers out to play on dreaded imperial starfleet, thus depriving you of those cool 0/5 destinies, but i have never seen this deck in action so it may not be a problem.  Anyhow, i'd really love to see this deck in action at the hands of superskrull, i'm sure with a little practice, it could apply some serious beatdown + it looks fun!</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Dredlox</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/dd8.GIF" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Even though I haven't tested or tried this deck yet, it does look decent and it is very original and therefore worthy of 4 stars.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">ChessMaster</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="10%"><IMG SRC="images/dd8.GIF" BORDER=0></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="90%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I like the orignal idea<br>

I like tie deck, but i don't see what this deck could do agaisnt a operative.  One sienar fleet is not enought, if you lose it early in the game, you're moslty over.  You also don't activate much, and bomber aren't as cheap to deploy as tie fighter. You also have no protection vs retrieving ligh side.  This mean a Deck using Death star plan or Harvest, on the edge, off the edge could hurt you very much.  There nothing you can really do agaisnt a one turn kill. Not much you can do versus a Dagobah deck. Does i really worth it to lose 2 cards to draw a 0 . ok epp is dead. but will you do enough battle damage with your ground force to win the game.  Also, Sienar can be cancel with alter ... if you don't occuppy. So this mean you have to leave some force on waleemui. I saw many time the tantive deploying there and battling the lone tie. Ouch.. Ok, nice try.<br>
