              <br>
              As this is the first edition, i'll sum up what's going on here. 
              Players send me reviews of a specified card. I compilate, review, 
              try to draw some conclusions, and factor in my own feelings on the 
              card. I'll then write my review, follow by a reprint of all the 
              reviews sent in. I will try not to repeat too much stuff that is 
              said in others, other than to summarize. At the end, i'll try to 
              think up some cards that could be useful with the reviewed card. 
              Thanks for reading, hopefully, we can get some good ideas out of 
              all this.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note from Editor. The card reviews 
              will now be based on a 5 star rating loosely adapted from the Inquest 
              star rating. I like it because it can be defined so well.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">***** Five stars - These are the cards 
              you see in tournaments time and time again. They are the best at 
              what they need to do. They can fit in nearly any deck, and generally 
              have excellent stand-alone value. ex. Darth Vader</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">**** Four stars - These are also very 
              good cards, but often are a notch below the quality of a five star 
              card, or lose a lot of effectiveness without supporting cards. Often 
              seen in tournaments, but generally in specific deck types. ex. How 
              did we get into this mess?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">*** Three stars - These are average 
              cards. They may be important in very specific deck types, but generally 
              have few outstanding capabilites and are not often seen in constructed 
              decks, or are used mostly when an expansion first comes out. Often 
              can be useful in a sealed deck. ex. astromech droids.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">** Two stars - A poor quality card. 
              They are either too slow, too expensive, or have some kind of prohibitive 
              drawback that makes them not very useful. Often there are other 
              cards that fulfill similar functions, but much better. Almost never 
              seen in a constructed deck, but in a sealed deck they might make 
              it. ex. Nikto</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* One star - A useless card. Often 
              serves no particular use, or is very easily disrupted. Never seen 
              at tournaments. ex. Ghoel</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Summary. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____Dbo, like any complex card, has 
              its strengths and weaknesses. I'll start with the strengths. Opponents 
              force drains are -1 are very powerful, and imperials deploy +2 at 
              dantooine sites helps secure the ground. Also, Dantooine is a fairly 
              secure starting location, and starting with a planet can have many 
              advantages, such as starting with nightfall or having a planet out 
              to put clouds on. You can also deploy non-unique sites or rebels 
              from the reserve deck, also a fairly useful ability, as you can 
              quickly flush out your zero destiny draws and set up a force base 
              early on. However, the advantages you get when the objective flips 
              are not really that powerful, other than the force drain -1. Squadrons 
              have a deployment restriction at Dantooine, hampering their combat 
              usefullness. Force drains +1 at systems with squadrons could be 
              useful, but remember the card has to be flipped to deploy them or 
              get a drain bonus. And here-in I think lies the biggest drawback.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____Dbo is pretty easily disrupted. 
              It is not that hard to flip back over. The opponent need only control 
              2 Dantooine locations, be they non-unique locations of his or cloud 
              sectors, or your own ground locations. And once Dbo is flipped over, 
              it is very difficult to flip back. First of all, you have to spread 
              out a fair amount on the ground, which is always dangerous. And 
              if you are planning on playing space, it is to say the least, very 
              difficult, to balance a ground deck, and a space deck. That being 
              said, though, occupy the ground and one or two squadrons at kessel, 
              kiffex and coruscant(drains of 4, 3 and 4) will spell quick doom 
              for an opponent, even with force drains -1. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____Furthermore, other deck types 
              can perform similar operations better, namely Local Uprising / Liberation. 
              You still get the force drains -1, a matching operative is worth 
              any 5 non-unique rebels you can name, you get force retrieval, locations 
              come out while the objective is flipped, force drain +1 at sites 
              with operatives, it is almost impossible to flip back over, etc,etc. 
              And if you're really into a space overpower deck, Hidden Base will 
              get you out fast (although i really question the effectiveness of 
              hidden base after the errata). Finally, although it's obviously 
              not in direct competion, Ralltiir Operations, is way better. Compare 
              - being able to deploy squadrons, as opposed to pulling out any 
              card from the reserve deck!!!(endless demonic tutor), and adding 
              to your battle destinies everywhere. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____One final note, although this 
              card seems not so hot now, it may change. If Decipher again reverses 
              the ruling on Ryle Torsyn being able to add a drain to every Dantooine 
              location (add 1 to each of your force drains at dantooine, strange 
              wording) then I think this deck could be very viable for a quick 
              spread out and drain. I'm looking at maximum drains of around 18 
              a turn with that.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Conclusion: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____Dbo's force drains -1 are definitely 
              the strongest part of this card, keeping it from a one star rating. 
              However the ineffectiveness of it, especially compared to other 
              objectives and deck types, makes it less than useful.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Overall rating: ** (two stars) (note 
              from editor - Eric originally gave a 3 out of 10 based on the intoductory 
              10 point scale. I am basically cutting it in half, and fitting it 
              into the criteria mentioned at the top of the page.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____In short, this card is nearly 
              binder fodder because it breaks one of the</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">cardinal rules of tourney level decks, 
              don't play heavy space AND heavy</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">ground. In order to gain the benefits, 
              you have to be playing large</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">quantities of both systems and squadrons 
              in order to get enough of them</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">out, as well as maintaining a large 
              ground presence in order to prevent</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">flipping.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____But let's take a look at another 
              reason why this card earns such a low</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">rating. The main benefit is it lets 
              your squadrons deploy, but wait,</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">they can only deploy to Dantooine. 
              What this means is the majority of</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">your air force may only deploy to one 
              system. In other words, you won't</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">win any major space battles because 
              you have little 'beatdown' capacity.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____Most of the other benefits this 
              card gives is better done by other</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">cards. Here's the list:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. Opponent's force drains are -1.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Generic operatives provides this bonus, 
              and is a heck of a lot easier to</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">keep flipped.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2. Immunity to attrition &lt; 4 and 
              battle destiny if not able to</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">otherwise.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This provides the battle bonus for 
              this deck. If you want to do</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">battling in space, use Hidden Base 
              - Xwing swarm with Organized Attack. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This provides far more battling bonus 
              than this meager bonus.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____Alternatively, generic operatives 
              are better than this, because they ADD</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">a battle destiny, and with a dozen 
              in the deck, who cares that they're</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">not immune to any attrition.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">3. Force drains are +1 with a squadron.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Again, generic operatives provide this, 
              and as a bonus, you never have</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">to flip the objective </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____Alternatively, EBO gives a bonus 
              of +2 to drains, and provides battle</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">bonuses to boot, and is only marginally 
              harder to activate if you build</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">your deck around it, and much harder 
              to cancel.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">4. Imperials are deploy +2 to Dantooine.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Not bad, but it's only to support the 
              above weak bonuses.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">5. Once per turn, may deploy a non-unique 
              rebel or generic site to</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dantooine.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____The saving grace, as it provides 
              a limited 'cheese' theme of deploying</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">rebel cadets and being able to play 
              numbers, especially good in concert</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">with 4 above.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____Now that we've looked at the benefits, 
              let's look at the requirements.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To flip, we must control 3 sites with 
              rebels, while preventing opponent</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">from controlling any locations. This 
              is probably not too difficult with</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">the +2 deploy for Imps, so I'll concede 
              an easy initial flip.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To keep flipped, we must prevent the 
              opponent from controlling two</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">locations. Obviously, the opponent 
              will not attempt to control the</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">system, so let's just deal with the 
              sites. With your forces split</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">between two fronts, you're basically 
              playing with 1/2 a ground deck. A</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">dedicated dark ground deck has a 'full' 
              ground deck to deal with your</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">forces. Even given the 'terrain' bonuses 
              from the obvious generic sites</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">of Forest/Swamp/Jungle, what are the 
              odds of preventing a take over from</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">the ground deck? Slim to none.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some closing thoughts:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____A dedicated space deck will prey 
              on your deployment restrictions to</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dantooine, and be able to choose the 
              places for major battles to take a</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">place, thus minimizing your space bonuses.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A dedicated ground deck will virtually 
              always be able to flip the</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">objective back due to your limited 
              ground power.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A dedicated clouds deck will drop two 
              clouds on Dantooine and slaughter</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">you in the clouds should you attempt 
              a challenge.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____Dantooine Base Operations (R, 
              Special Edition), arguably the least </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">played of all 10 objectives currently 
              in the game, is primarily an </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">objective designed to enhance a rarely 
              seen card subtype: squadrons. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Squadrons, despite their high permanent 
              pilot ability, cost-efficient </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">movement and overall bang per card 
              slot, are difficult to deploy (even </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">with the advent of DBO), do not offer 
              the movement flexibility of </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">individual starships, and are prime 
              targets for the arsenal of Dark </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">starship weapons. An SFS L-s9.3 Laser 
              Cannons (C, Special Edition) needs </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">to draw only a 1 for destiny to cause 
              a squadron of Y-wings to be </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">immediately lost (a hefty loss). Squadron 
              cards themselves are also </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">moderately difficult to obtain-the 
              only two available for the Light Side </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">are X-wing Assault Squadron (R, Special 
              Edition) and Y-wing Assault </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Squadron (U1, A New Hope). Despite 
              these problems, DBO remains a card </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">of high potential.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____Like its Dark sister Ralltiir 
              Operations (R, Special Edition), DBO </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">forces you to start with its corresponding 
              system, and lets you deploy </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">sites or non-unique Rebels from Reserve 
              Deck to that system. To aid in </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">fulfilling the moderately difficult 
              goal of controlling three Dantooine </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(U2, Premiere) sites with Rebels (while 
              not allowing your opponent to </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">control any), DBO has the added bonus 
              of making Imperials deploy +2 to </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dantooine locations.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____The flip side, however, is markedly 
              different from its "twin." Aside </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">from the powerful Force drain reduction 
              (and retaining the added deploy </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">cost for the opponent), DBO casts off 
              many of the shackles that restrict </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">squadrons. Rather than Ralltiir Ops' 
              "search for any card" text, DBO </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">lets X-wing and Y-wing squadrons deploy 
              for 6 and 3 Force, respectively, </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">to Dantooine (both great deploy-forfeit 
              ratios), are granted immunity to </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">attrition &lt; 4, guaranteed battle 
              destiny draws and Force drain bonuses </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">where present.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____Most Dark decks (even pure space 
              decks) can't handle this kind of power. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Confrontation is much easier for the 
              Light side with this cheap, </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">recyclable space power. On the off-chance 
              that you do have to lose a </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">squadron in battle, merely place it 
              on a Docking And Repair Facilities </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(R, Special Edition) for a high-power 
              card that, because of its </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">asterisk-defined deploy cost, returns 
              to your hand for free. It gets </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">even better with cards like Incom Engineer 
              (C, Special Edition), </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Organized Attack (C, Special Edition) 
              and S-foils (C, Special Edition). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Using the latter two of those makes 
              each of your X-wing Assault </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Squadrons deploy 6, forfeit 12 and 
              power 18. For defense against the </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">rare weapon-laden TIE decks, A Few 
              Maneuvers (C, Premiere) is an </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">excellent high-destiny defensive measure. 
              If the opponent is weak in </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">space, or merely avoids you, take advantage 
              with high drain systems. A </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">flipped DBO with squadrons at Coruscant 
              (R, Special Edition) and Kessel </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(U2, Premiere) will net you drains 
              of 4 at each of those locations. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Adding a squadron-controlled Kiffex 
              (R, Jabba's Palace) gives a total </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">drain of 11 per turn-amazing for a 
              deck style not part of the modern </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">metagame in most places. Other space 
              cards will mix well with DBO: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asteroid Sanctuary (C, Dagobah) and 
              Kessel Run (R2, Premiere). Or, throw </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">in A Gift (U, Jabba's Palace) and Artoo

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">_____DBO also works well in several 
              decks where you do not intend to flip it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Its always functional deploy +2 cost 
              for Imperials has great potential. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By replacing Bothawui Operatives (C, 
              Special Edition) with Ithorians (C, </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">a Droid Merchant (C, Special Edition)

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">actually mixes well with squadrons) 
              or a Nabrun Leids / Beatdown deck. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The cost increase also serves insert 
              decks well, whose characters are </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">typically weaker than others. For added 
              protection, throw in Goo Nee </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Tay! (R, Special Edition) and H'nemthes 
              (C, Jabba's Palace). With </font></p>

              met at Homefront Hobbies in Williamsport, PA for a Bespin &amp; 
              Beyond Swiss Tournament. Two new players also attended to learn 
              how to play the game. I am hoping to help them construct decks so 
              that they will be able to play at the next tournament in 2 weeks. 
              Thanks to all those players who donated their unwanted cards to 
              these two new players. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I decided to try some new prize distribution 
              methods, which included "Bingo" prizes with posters, stickers, and 
              a pack for the lowest ranked game. I opened the 7 packs of Japanese 
              cards, and found both a LUKE SKYWALKER and OBI'S LIGHTSABER!!! I 
              saved those two for special prizes at the end of the</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">day, and had players choose a couple 
              of the Japanese cards every time they completed one game. The $3 
              entry fee was used to purchase prizes from the store owner at a 
              nice discount. Thanks Brian!!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We had two undefeated players, who 
              never faced each other as they were both playing the same allegiance 
              for the final game. Congratulations to Ben Hughes, who took first 
              place, using both a LS and a DS Operative deck. Bryan Westerby was 
              also undefeated, with a lower differential. While his DS deck</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">did use the Operative Objective, his 
              LS deck did not contain an Objective, relying instead on the raw 
              power associated with 19 Sandspeeders on steroids. Chad Chervinsky 
              rose above the crowd to take 3rd place, his best showing ever.</font></p>

              met at Homefront Hobbies in Williamsport, PA for a Sanctioned Swiss 
              Tournament. The Dark Side continued to dominate, winning 67% of 
              the games (16 out of 24). Operative decks seemed to be the most 
              successful this week, although other successful strategies</font></p>

              there. I think my ranking would be around 2-300 more than any elses, 
              so I was kinda disappointed with that.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">My DS deck was a HDADTJ deck using

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Game 1, my DS vs a newbie</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As my pairing was announced, a whole 
              lot of people were telling me to go easy on the kid. He was playing 
              with the MPGs as his starting location, and therefore got out the 
              fourth marker. My first hand landed me with POTF, Choking Vader 
              and Vader's Stick. I felt kinda guilty as I plonked Vader down while 
              carefully explaining what each and every card down for an effective 
              drain of 5 (the three at the 4th, and 2 to VOTE). A solitary rebel 
              guard threw himself in front of Vader, with a 2/2 pilot at the Snow 
              Trench on my opponent's turn. Tarkin joined Darth and made short 
              work of the single rebel guard, and I was basically draining for 
              2 a turn, until</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bane and the Downtown Plaza arrived. 
              Bane helped chasing the pilot, until he decided to leave this 2/2 
              pilot in front of Vader and Tarkin. I asked why he did that, and 
              he said that it was because I'll just keep chasing the 2/2 pilot. 
              I carefully explained that I was chasing him in the hope I caught 
              him, and pounded him. I was more than willing to allow the 2/2 guy 
              to move away (hey, I guess I'm just a nice bloke :) Soon after this, 
              another 2/2 pilot (a SE one, I think) turned up at the Downtown 
              Plaza, and after getting Tarkin + Darth out from under the shields, 
              I teleported to the DP and pounded that pilot too. Game Over. After 
              the game, I helped</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">him out a bit with basic stuff (think 
              things through a bit more), and gave him some cards from my trade 
              folder I didn't need (Tarkin, Motti, Djas Puhr, Off the Edge) and 
              he wanted. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This guy was playing an odd ISB deck 
              that might have worked if it was better :) Basically, he started 
              with the Coruscant location which allows you to add a destiny to 
              power if you've got a general there. I was pretty quick in getting 
              out all my systems, and draining a fair bit before he eventually 
              got a Probe Droid down to the Imperial Square (?) and Veers followed 
              soon</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">after. I did have trouble finding Kessel 
              (it seemed to have stuck itself to another card) which might have 
              mattered in another game, but here it didn't. I flipped anyway, 
              and was draining nicely, when he got a probe droid antenna onto 
              the probe droid, and a dune walker at the jungle on Bothawui he'd 
              deployed. I sent Luke and Han and some others to bash on the dune 
              walker,</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">and Obi and Harc Seff joined for the 
              beat down on Veers + Probot. Later in the game, he flipped the objective 
              on his second last turn, which was kinda cute, so I nabruned and 
              knocked off Piett sitting by himself, which speeded things up considerably. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Big win - 30ish</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Game 3 (?), my LS vs a Knowledge + 
              Defense CHYBC Nal Hutta Ops deck. I was surprised to see this deck 
              today, since I hadn't expected much info from this listserv to get 
              there. Never mind, I figured I should be able to beat it. Harc Seff 
              went sick down on Nal Hutta blocking a drain, two</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">from Hidden Base, often one to Rebel 
              fleet, and every now and then he got a drain off. He was slow in 
              flipping his objective, which helped me, but I was cancelling enough 
              drains for it to not be such a problem. On his second last turn, 
              he only had 3 Operatives left, and had just inserted K+D into my 
              deck. I had already had Han and stick on Nal Hutta, and here was 
              my play of the day:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Han and Harc Seff at Jungle. His Operative 
              moved to there, along with a Dune Walker, and Jabba (?). Anyway, 
              the Operative stayed outside. I battled, hit the operative, and 
              he lost it as a result of the battle, I didn't lose much at all. 
              On my next turn, I activated lots, and set</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">off K+D, flipping his objective back 
              (he no longer had the 3 battlegrounds - there were no battlegrounds). 
              I proceded to cancel most of his drains, and then it was my turn. 
              I activated, drained for 3 at Kessel, 3 at Coruscant, 2 at Kiffex, 
              and 1 at a couple of other systems, at which point he said 'oh, 
              I forgot to flip my objective back (K+D had finished)' I pointed 
              out</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">that he no longer controlled 3 battleground 
              sites with operatives. I then counted out a small win by 9 or so 
              force. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I got Vader with Lightsaber, Dr. Evazan, 
              Boba with Gun and Tarkin out all pretty early, and they Elised all 
              over the place beating up on stuff (Dr.E and two guns works really 
              nicely) by disarming and operating on any EPP mains and then just 
              hitting and operating on operatives, often leaving a cloud car or 
              something to receive the brunt of the damage. He soon ran</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">out of Houjixs, and though he did get 
              a couple of big drains off (TGM, Clouds,</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ops = drain of 5), I just Elised and 
              won through battle damage. If he had a</font></p>

              fortunate to be able to deploy some ground locations to drain at, 
              while he deployed no locations until late in the game when he deployed 
              the Hoth system. I was Nabrunning all over the place, trying to 
              kill off Choking Darth and deploy Han with gun 3/4 times (retrieval

              be popular, and hence SFS decks wouldn't be in the top bracket with 
              me, and therefore wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, they were 
              :) It was simply a case of bad and misjudged metagaming.</font></p>

              to solve for the assymetric case"</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____In previous ramblings by A. Sujdak, 
              a systematic framework of assumptions was provided for exploring 
              metagames of a symmetric type. Below is a brief sketch of things 
              to come in my research of how to solve for the assymetric case, 
              and also a pseudo proof of the solubility of an assymetric meta.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Let the lowercase w after a decktype 
              denote that decktype's aggregate winning percentage--i.e., its winning 
              percentage if it were to play onegame against each opponent in the 
              entire field. Also let the lowercase pafter a decktype denote its 
              proportion of the total field. Let the light side decktypes be represented 
              by L1, L2, etc. and let the dark side decktypes be represented by 
              D1, D2, etc. Lastly, let the metagame winning percentage matrix 
              be represented byM[a,b], where the value of the matrix at any particular 
              coordinate is the percentage of time that decktype a defeats decktype 
              b.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Unlike A. Sujdak's first Equilibrium 
              Theory, it must be additionally assumed that players do not take 
              expected margins of victory into account when they decide which 
              deck to play. We then arrive at the following system of linear equations: 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">LNw = Lw for all N </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">DIw = Dw for all I </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____This is an extension of the normal 
              equilibrium theory. It can no longer be assumed that decks are bound 
              to a fifty percent winning percentage, because it is possible to 
              have a stable meta in which light (dark) wins morethan dark (light). 
              The new restriction is simply that all decks on the sameside of 
              the force must have the same winning percentage. If this were not 
              true then the number of people playing the deck with the best winning 
              percentage characteristics would increase and either it would be 
              hosed and dragged back down to the same win character as the other 
              decktypes or no counter would exist in which case all players would 
              play that decktype. These sets of restrictions give (total number 
              of decktypes) minus two equations. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">sum(LNp) over N = 1 </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">and </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">sum(DIp) over I = 1 </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____This gives two more equations which 
              basically define the decktype populations as representing that percentage 
              of the field which plays a particular decktype. The restriction 
              obviously comes from the fact that as more people play one decktype 
              the number of people playing other decktypes on that side of the 
              force must decrease. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">sum(M[ i, j ] * Ljp) over j = Diw and 
              sum(M[ i, j] * Djp) = Liw </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____This gives one equation for each 
              decktype basically stating that the aggregate win percentage for 
              a deck is a linear summation of its winning percentages against 
              opposing decktypes times their frequency in themeta. This system 
              of equations gives two equations for each decktype. Since we have 
              two descriptors for each decktype, aggregate winning percentage 
              and population, we have arrived at a solvable system of equations 
              (assuming that none of the boundedness restrictions is violated, 
              in which case asolution is still possible but will be dynamic and 
              non-deterministic in nature).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____The real trick in arriving at a 
              succesful adaptation of Eq. Theory was to find a way to state the 
              equilibrium condition. It took a fair amount of time on the part 
              of the author to see the new winning conditions. I then nearly overlooked 
              the population restriction equations and was ready to write an article 
              stating that assymetric metas were insoluble! Fortuneatly, I developed 
              a brain at the last minute and you have the masterpiece(hehehe) 
              that you see before you. Honestly, I'm not sure how easy it will 
              be to obtain a deterministic solution but I'm hoping for the best. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I haven't had much time to probe into 
              empirical validation, either, because I had a birthday yesterday. 
              Surprise parties ruin your work plans.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In any case, to give some sort of real-world 
              applicability to what you see above, I see the current metagame 
              as consisting of the following:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">LS: HB X-wing, Maelstrom, Bothan Ops</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">DS: ISGhhhk, SFS, HDADTJ</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____I know that multiple variants exist 
              of each of these decktypes, but they have similiar performance characteristics. 
              Furthermore I do not believe that there is a significant population 
              of decks that exist completely outside the above meta. With three 
              general decktypes on each side of the force, all that really needs 
              to be done is to find M, the win matrix,and it SHOULD be possible 
              to predict the stable population of each decktype. With a relatively 
              simple meta like above it will be interesting to see how well the 
              theory agrees with the empirical findings (i.e., global popularities 
              of each of the different decktypes).</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ffffff">Jim Li "Traffic Control 
              and Reactor Terminal"</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Recently on the Listserve I've 
              heard a little debate going back and forth about the benefits of 
              Reactor Terminal/Traffic Control. Some people put these cards in 
              every deck because they help get unwanted cards out of your hand, 
              recycle high destiny, protect you from Monnok/Grimtassh etc. While 
              others argue that these 2 cards give you a false sense of safety 
              and allow you to overdraw in order to find them, and wreck you if 
              you don't.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____I haven't put a Reactor Terminal 
              in my deck for quite a few months. Traffic control made a cameo 
              in my Dagobah training deck due to the high number of useless destiny 
              7s in that deck, but it hasn't been in any of my other decks. I 
              follow the belief that you should never draw up so many cards that 
              not having a Traff/Term will leave you with very little force. I 
              always try to keep my hand under 12 cards when possible. Not having 
              those cards hasn't really affected my games that much.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Secret Tech: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____I first saw an Ishi Tib being played 
              by another highly skilled player in my area. For those of you who 
              don't know what an ishi tib does, it is an LS non-unique (3 dots) 
              alien, power and ability = 1 (but armor = 3) that deploys for 2. 
              Destiny 3, and during your draw phase, allows you to put one card 
              from you hand at the bottom of your used pile, and draw a card. 
              At first glance a pretty useless card, but if you play with it for 
              a while, you realize that its ability is awesome. In my decks that 
              don't contain Traffic Control, this card is almost always in and 
              serves the same functions. It helps protect me from monnok, allows 
              me to recycle that useless Don't forget the droids, etc. About the 
              only thing that it doesn't do is boost my differential at the end 
              of a game.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Term/Control also serves a different 
              purpose. In a tournament game, it allows you to put your entire 
              hand in your used pile at the end of the game to boost your differential. 
              This is a really attractive part of Term/control, and has helped 
              many players needing differential, but I'll tell you why I don't 
              use it. First, if you win all of your games, differential matters 
              very little. While I realize that this is not always possible, I 
              try my hardest to win first and worry about differential later. 
              Second, you opponent, if they are a tournament veteran, will pick 
              up on what you're trying to do and simply draw up a turn before 
              you drain them to death, making Term/control pointless. Third, and 
              the deciding factor for me, is that when I'm making a deck, there 
              are always a couple more "cool" cards that I want to throw in,and 
              this doesn't leave any room for recyclers. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____I hope this article has been somewhat 
              helpful. I guess I am of the opinion that Traffic Control and Reactor 
              Terminal aren't necessary in most decks and can be replaced by more 
              useful cards.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____These types of exchanges are becoming 
              more and more common these days. Since the objectives came out, 
              themes like Jedi Training don't need as many doubles as before so 
              there are now open slots forcards. There are a good number of people 
              turning to destiny 7 cards to fill those slots. With Mind What You 
              Have Learned/Save You It Can, you can pull Yoda and Son of Skywalker 
              (SOS) out of your deck so you don't need to run multiples of each. 
              With these slots opening up you need to find a card or group of 
              cards that makes your opponent lose force or that prevent you from 
              losing force. With cards such as Counter and Surprise Assault, in 
              the past these have been used sparingly because you didn't have 
              a good ration of destinies because your deck was packed full of 
              characters. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Now it is not uncommon to see a 
              Jedi Training or Hunt Down deck with multiples of Counter and Surprise 
              Assaults. These cards have increased in playing ability do to the 
              fact that the overall average destiny number in your deck has risen 
              exponentially. This "combo" makes your opponent wary of draining, 
              so in turn you are both preventing force loss (loss of drain) and 
              dealing damage (counter/surprise assault). And besides who couldn't 
              use another destiny seven in their deck.</font></p>

              the drawing of a successful sense is small, unless you have a Jedi 
              in play. Some other ways of dealing with this is "catch" cards (What 
              are you trying to push on us/There'll be hell to pay). Every time 
              they play a counter/surprise assault is pulled from their deck and 
              placed here and they have to pay an additional one each time. Now 
              this is a viable counter, but by the third or fourth one of these, 
              the damage they have inflicted will be devastating. Another way 
              of dealing with this theme is Grimnok (Grimtaash/Monnok). Since 
              they will have multiple 7 destiny cards there will more then likely 
              be doubles in their hand. And finally the most viable (I feel) counter 
              is Ability X3/Civil Disorder. Since they have so many non-character 
              cards, they will plenty of time sweating these effects.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____A recent concern in the Star Wars 
              community has been the rise of decks that use swarms of non-unique 
              cards, getting away from Main characters and the "spirit of Star 
              Wars". Likewise, many current deck designs are non-interactive, 
              and focus on force draining the opponent to death while making it 
              difficult to battle and do damage (Operatives, ISB Operations, Hidden 
              Base). Heres an aggressive deck that makes use of some Mains and 
              takes the fight to the opponent. Its probably not the design I 
              would take to a major tournament, but it does extremely well in 
              local play. More importantly, its a design that emphasizes Main 
              characters and encourages the dark side to battle. An analysis of 
              the deck elements follows the deck list.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Locations:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____The idea behind this deck is to 
              play against your opponent, preferably on their locations. My area 
              is rife with Operatives, and most Operative decks provide 2 force 
              on your first turn, allowing the 6 force necessary to drop Vader 
              on their starting location (which is generally the Farm) and flip 
              the Objective on the first turn.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____The locations are geared towards 
              safe activation - the Jabbas Palace sites and Imperial Holotable 
              are all immune to Revolution. In an area where Revolution is heavily 
              played, I would increase the number of Evaders in the deck and add 
              more locations for force generation. Currently, the 7 sites is enough, 
              as Operatives and Hidden Base tend to provide quite a bit of quick 
              force to the Dark Side. Masterful Move and the Jabbas Palace game 
              text also allow some sites to come out of the deck. Dont forget 
              the additional activation at the Holotheater once Vader is on the 
              table.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Characters:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Its important early in the game 
              to read the opponents deck and come up with a game plan. Against 
              Operatives, I tend to deploy Vader immediately, and then begin developing 
              hit squads - Vader/Tarkin, Vader/Evazan, Boba Fett/Evazan, Chall 
              Bekan/Boelo, Jabba/Boelo, Blizzard 2/ORS, etc - there are many combinations 
              of these characters that are effective in battle.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Green and Blue Cards:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____This is certainly not enough ships 
              to effectively battle a Hidden Base deck. However, it is possible 
              to probe with 4 ships, especially under the new HB rules. Bossk 
              in Hounds tooth is key because of the added destiny.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Interrupts:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____The interrupts are geared towards 
              defeating a non-unique deck. Alter and Monnok are the main ingredients; 
              get rid of pitch effects (ie, Bargaining Table) and Yarna, and then 
              go to town with the Monnoks. Against an Operative deck, the constant 
              pressure of Vader draining and battling on the Operative planet, 
              along with Visage loss and Monnok, is overwhelming. I would employ 
              a similar strategy vs Hidden Base - use speed to begin the damage 
              early, bolstered by Monnok. As the opponent spreads to make Hidden 
              Base active, he becomes vulnerable to some of the light space elements 
              in the deck.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____As for other interrupts, Shocking 
              Revelation will be discussed in conjunction with Secret Plans (below). 
              Holonet Transmission protects the Visage against Termination and 
              makes an additional hologram for the Holotable. Torture is anti-inserts 
              - I find that whenever you assume you wont face any inserts and 
              take out your insert protection, you play against all numbers decks. 
              Its a law. Torture and Dont Forget the Droids belong in most Mains 
              decks.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Effects:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____I start with Secret Plans. Not 
              only does retrieval overcome the early fast damage that Visage inflicts, 
              but the ability to pull Shocking Revelation (and recycle it) each 
              turn is very useful. The keys to getting this deck moving fast are: 
              Vader in the opening hand and a battleground site to deploy him. 
              If either of these elements are not present, the recycling Shock 
              can let you deduce the contents of your active force pile, allowing 
              you to judiciously draw up force or leave it (of course, you need 
              to know the deck contents well, but that should be a given). This 
              maximizes the decisions you make early in the game. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____For instance, if I dont have a 
              Vader in the opening hand or force pile, I may look to the next 
              option perhaps an early Monnok. Likewise if the opponent starts 
              Goo Nee Tay to slow Vader down a little.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____The other effect that bears a close 
              look at is Broken Concentration. Against a training deck, of course 
              this is a useful starting effect. However, it also warrants a card 
              slot as a defensive card. The pay to move a force back onto opponents 
              force pile is extremely effective against cards that require force 
              to be saved up - Its a Trap, Quite a Mercenary, Whatre You Trying 
              to Push on Us, especially when you have prior knowledge of the opponents 
              hand with a Monnok and know what the force is being saved up for 
              at that point, drop Broken Concentration and go to town.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____The second Visage is important 
              if your original is cancelled; the steady Visage damage is a constant 
              poke, and will be the deciding factor in a long, defensive game. 
              Because of the popularity of Transmission Terminated, I tend to 
              pull Holonet Transmission early on with a Masterful Move as added 
              protection.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Conclusion:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____This deck has a lot of room for 
              variance based on your local tournament scene. As mentioned, this 
              version is designed to face off against Operatives, and to provide 
              an interactive, aggressive experience beating on those nasty little 
              shadows on the Operative planet. Character removal in battle (using 
              Vaders choke, Evazans game text, or You Are Beaten) is useful 
              in avoiding extra battle destinies provided by the Operative or 
              an Epp combo. Some improvements would be making room for an additional 
              Elis Helrot, or adding another grabber card, like Therell Be Hell 
              to Pay. Against a field with a lot of X Wing swarm decks, add a 
              Ghhhk to be pulled out with Masterful Move.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ffffff">David Destefanis "The 
              Defensive Strategy"</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____The Defensive player is the nemesis 
              of the Offensive player: he first build defenses, then attack his 
              opponent when he feels/is safe from any countermeasure. This is 
              somehow much more difficult to do efficiently than to jump early 
              on your opponent to kill him. Thus, good and winning defending decks 
              are somewhat rare in the tournament scene. But since the first players 
              fear is to lose, many tend to begin their tournament experience 
              as Defensive players.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&#9;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____In the end, an usual SW:CCG player 
              has decks with a versatile and general defense capability and a 
              much more pronounced offense part (which will result to be his deck 
              strategy).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ffffff">What are the basis 
              of the Defensive Deck ?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1)&#9;Locations: Defensive decks dont 
              have that many location, so you wont see a Def. Deck with 10 locations. 
              This is because the more locations you put inside your deck, the 
              more your opponent will be able to drain you if these are on table; 
              then, you waste precious card space better used elsewhere. The average 
              number is between 6 to 8.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2)&#9;Characters/starships/vehicles 
              : here there is also an upper limit, because the deck purpose is 
              not to control every location in the game, but that doesnt mean 
              that a defensive deck has a lower average number of ch/st/veh, just 
              that they will be very different from an usual type of deck, with 
              roles pretty much defined within the decks strategy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">3)&#9;Interrupts/Effects: these are 
              the core components of the Defensive deck, and range from pure defensive 
              ones, like Wars Not Make One Great/Narrow Escape to more nasty damaging 
              ones like Uncontrollable Fury/Surprise Assault. Most Defensive decks 
              also count on regeneration methods like Kessel Run/Off The Edge, 
              since it is likely that in the overall the Defensive deck will be 
              dealt more damage than the opponents one.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">4)&#9;At least 1 offensive tactic to 
              damage the opponent (since the Time Win isnt what players are looking 
              for).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">5)&#9;A well, thoroughly studied game 
              plan. If you stay on the defensive, you let players develop their 
              strategies, so you had better have a solid game plan if you are 
              to survive to the opponents constant attentions. Thus, a Defensive 
              deck needs much more refining than other decks.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ffffff">What are the basis 
              of a GOOD Defensive Deck ?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Method 1: the Defensive deck doesnt 
              care what the opponent do, since it will be able to recover from 
              even the sturdiest attack with Force Retrieval. This usually means 
              a good retrieval method, the more foolproof possible, and a heavy 
              one also. These decks usually concentrate on their retrieval capability 
              and damage the opponent in an also safe way (and slow, like Holo-drain). 
              Just why they prefer slow and safe methods is not really difficult 
              to guess: these decks usually cannot spare more than a few card 
              slots to pure offensive strategies, so the player doesnt want to 
              gamble on the security of those cards. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An example of an average method 1 deck 
              would be the All Droid/Numbers with Off The Edge. In this case, 
              the defending player will have to protect Artoo from destruction 
              (here go a few interrupts) to play Off The Edge on Cloud City, will 
              have to somehow counter huge drain with Surprise Assaults, and damage 
              the opponent with insert effects (and Surprise Assault) while making 
              them appear on the top of the opponents Reserve Deck with cards 
              such as CC: Sabaac (use Retractable Arm on a R2-unit), Beru Stew, 
              Blue Milk, Recoil In Fear, or Wars Not Make One Great. The main 
              problem, however, is the gamble factor: the Surprise Assault may 
              work once, but it is not a foolproof tactic, and insert effects 
              dont tell you if they are going to show at the top of your opponents 
              deck before you are dead; also, counter exist. This deck is too 
              much unreliable to be useful at top-level competition.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A good example of a good method one 
              deck would be the Mind What Have You Learned/Save You It Can deck. 
              Yes, this is the famous deck nobody plays but everyone wants to 
              hear about (or at least see a good one). The deck, with all its 
              data, will be posted separately.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&#9;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Method 2: the Defensive decks cares 
              what the opponent do, and change its tactic accordingly. This kind 
              of deck deliberately leaves the initiative to the opponent and mold 
              itself to partially/totally shut it down, and then damage him where 
              he is not so well prepared to have a confrontation. In this case, 
              the Defensive deck has riskier offensive methods than the method 
              1 deck, because he has more cards on his offensive strategy list 
              and knows the opponent has already spent most of his elsewhere. 
              So when this decks kicks in, he will damage the other one badly 
              each turn without too much fear of retaliation, while blocking the 
              others drains nearly everywhere else. The Baragwin deck was a perfect 
              pre-SE example of a good method 2 deck, but other could also be 
              more fight-oriented, without retrieval methods but more characters/spies/landing 
              claws/starships. Narrow Escape is a card to build decks upon, now 
              that S/A/C are no more so predominant.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&#9;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Method 3: it is a much more personal 
              method/approach. Before continuing on, lets see together what you 
              can possibly do in a SW: CCG game, and what would you like to be 
              able to do:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1)&#9;You would like to know the composition 
              of the opponents deck, and possibly in the details. It may be crucial 
              to know if your opponent has or has not a particular counter(s) 
              to your strategy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2)&#9;You would like to be able to 
              have all your needed cards in hand. This doesnt rely only on luck.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">3)&#9;You would like to be protected 
              from any nasty/broken/predominant deck strategy out there.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">4)&#9;You would like to be lucky. J 
              Well, this is scientifically impossible to achieve, but the Force 
              is here, believe me</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">5)&#9;You could heavily damage your 
              opponent.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">6)&#9;You could quickly and without 
              much risks retrieve Force.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">7)&#9;You would like to win with huge 
              differentials most of the time, so as not to worry about differential 
              issues in tournament.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">8)&#9;The Force is your ally, so the 
              less you squander, the best it would be, but is that possible ? 
              This may seems a card efficiency problem, but there is more than 
              meets the eye.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">9)&#9;You would like to have many different 
              nasty cards/tricks, but also to be somewhat sure to play them during 
              the game.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">10)&#9;You would like to have fun and 
              have a challenge.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">11)&#9;(And last) You would like to 
              see your opponent lose by his own hands. (This is a more personal 
              opinion)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Well, all the last 11 points are 
              possible to accomplish, but usually not all 11 together (if you 
              still want to win).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Strange as it may seems, my DDMs 
              LS Deck accomplishes them all. As I won the 98 Chandrilla Regional 
              thanks to it, this is not idle chatter. This is what I call a close-to-perfection 
              method 3 deck. Method 3 decks are decks that escape the bounds of 
              logic, and so work with the same efficiency nearly all the time, 
              and also seem to take advantage from the opponent knowing its composition. 
              (I would even think they work best (=safely) when the opponent already 
              dealt with it and lost). The DDMs LS Deck will also be posted elsewhere 
              (for space issues).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Conclusion: The Defensive Option 
              is maybe, on the paper, the strongest one. But games arent won 
              on Defense alone. So each Defensive deck has to contain some Offensive 
              elements. The reverse is not true, however, and this is what makes 
              Offensive decks (in general) more efficient: they are quicker, nastier, 
              and usually card-efficient. Now, with all the different deck types 
              out there (and with all the different viable offensive strategies), 
              it is much more difficult to be ready to face them all. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____Even so, Defensive decks usually 
              have always the means to win a particular game. To find out, usually, 
              players use a term: the "turning point". The turning point happens 
              when the Defensive deck kicks in: i.e. when the player manages to 
              get his strategy going. At this point, the Defensive player usually 
              is able to mount a come back through Force retrieval or to block 
              damage to his deck altogether. This usually means the end of the 
              opponents chances of winning. But the turning point is not easy 
              to accomplish (especially in SE), because of the possible early 
              damage the Defensive deck could take. Somehow, especially if the 
              damage is high, it is possible for the Defensive deck to lose some 
              crucial cards to its strategy and not to be able to retrieve them 
              afterwards.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">____This is why Defensive decks tend 
              to lose in harsh tournaments. Another reason is that the same defending 
              players are "bored" to see that they have to quicken their deck 
              to reach the turning point (which usually means less deck versatility 
              in the overall defense). But defensive decks are not dead, and they 
              will continue to appear on the tournament scene.</font></p>

              <br>
              _____The future is looking bright for Team DeckTech. I had hoped 
              to write a article about how to prepare for your regional qualifiers. 
              But wisdom prevailed and I decided it should go out in the next 
              issue insted. The article will contain theories about the 'Peak 
              Performance' phenomenom that hinders player that come from small 
              tounament scenes as they go into a qualifying tournament. It also 
              suggest some rather controversial ways we as members of Team DeckTech 
              can network together to overcome this phenomenom as well as any 
              of our competition. I hope many of you are prepared to go to worlds 
              this year, I think it will be fun.</font></p>
