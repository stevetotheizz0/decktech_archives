Well, the first one that I&#39;ve attended anyways =)<br>
<br>
Pre-tourney was an adventure in itself with the acquisition of another box, thankfully Aragorn, Gandalf and Arwen made appearences which somewhat subsided the constant tooking pouring from my mouth as a result of in my opinion the poor distribution that I had received. 3 boxes with no Sting, Aragorn&#39;s Bow or Boromir had me slightly irritated, as well as one copy of more or less all of the strong cards of the game bothered me slightly, especially considering over here where we pay just below $200 a box these days. That being said, the usual Friday night meeting of &#39;The Group&#39; comprised of Ellie, Adam and myself. The night progressed with the usual myriad of inside jokes (invisible penis fighting), television show quoting (mines the one with, the flag on the bonnet) and hot dog bun purchasing. Much discussion was also devoted to the justification for my buying of tokens to play the game with (I claim that they were for my fish tank) and sexual jokes at my expense. Adam and I played a couple of games, he rotating the use of his decks between his Dwarf/Elves or his Men/Elves deck and I went with the just constructed &#39;Rinse and Repeat&#39; that drew large amounts of cards and increased my move limit when it suited me to win the game. Whilest mine wasnt a solid deck, it went 1-1 with at one stage the deck giving up 31 twilight to Adam and he wasnt able to do anything due to a poor hand. At the end he was at site 6 I think stuck fighting Nazgul, whilest I had finished the game. Its a work in progress =)<br>
<br>
Other than that, it was another Saturday night with the group, we woke up at the crack of dawn to make it into the city for the sealed, Ellie and I were playing, though Adam wasnt due to financial reasons, so we both decided that in between us a Sauron box would be a gimme. Unfortunately, a Hobbit and a Gandalf came our way, so we cracked open our single pack and filed through the rares. Ellie grabbed a rare Boromir which was sweet, I on the other hand pulled nothing (I believe my rare&#39;s opening sentence was &#39;Spot Gandalf&#39; and another rare said &#39;Spot an Elf&#39;), bringing on a feeling of dread as I contemplated a day of playing the same game all day against different opponents. A slight sort through the cards i had brought about three strategic considerations before I started play, which went something like this....<br>
<br>
1) Bounders are gods in sealed.<br>
2) Going first in sealed is a must.<br>
3) The stealth cards a nice early, but game winning late.<br>
<br>
Armed with these thoughts, Terry the TD called the opening pairs and we begun.<br>
<br>
Game 1 vs some guy I didnt know.<br>
I approached this bloke and sat down with my nicely sleeved deck, pulled all my color coded stuff out and watched my opponent build his deck before my very eyes. I felt from start to finish of this game that I should win it, and the fact that i didnt still somewhat disappoints me when I think of it. Going second after winning the burdens (what the hell was I thinking???) I took control of the tempo of the game, sitting just on my opponents tail through site 6, and hampering his efforts with an early Black Breath and the usual gaggle of Nazgul. Late game I had Frodo and Sam representing the fellowship and meant to make a move for the win, though the opportunity never materialized, as my opponent often had one or two minions on the table and plenty of twilight to play with. I moved with the option of taking him out with minions, proceeding to ditch fellowship cards in a hope of a last turn swarm for the win with my Sauron stuff. At site 9, I managed to reduce his fellowship to only Frodo with a Bounder in tow. I dropped 41 worth of power in between Nazgul and Sauron Orcs, and thought that I had the game. 4 stealth events later, plus the Bounder, and my 41 power wasnt quite enough to match the 48 I needed for the win, and I went down in a ball of 41 power flames.<br>
<br>
Full Loss 0-1<br>
<br>
Game 2 vs Leigh Smith<br>
Leigh is a former Star Wars player who had also been a convert to LOTR, so it was nice to be able to play someone that I had some previous experience with, and Leigh is a competitive guy, so I knew I was in for a handful in the least. Unfortunately for Leigh, he must have drowned in the toilet or something ridiculously similar, because he was seriously, about 30 minutes late to this game, to the point of my asking Terry whether or not he should have forfeited, since the point of playing a game over 30 minutes was near farcical in my view. Since I was not the TD however, it was not my decision to make, and I sat down with Leigh to play the game regardless. As it happens, Leigh dominated the game from its short start to its short finish, even though I started first with 4 burdens to his 0. In retrospect, I probably should have started 0, however I felt we may have had enough time to make for site 9, and in the end we made it to 6, so I wasnt that far behind anyways. Leigh&#39;s Sauron Orcs were causing me all sorts of grief though (as well as his Blade Tip and Black Breath start...), and I didnt deserve to win even if I had have.<br>
<br>
Timed Loss 0-2<br>
<br>
Game 3 vs Ellie Brown<br>
Just after lunch I sat down with fellow group member Ellie and started about 10 minutes late due to a late McDonalds run, but it didnt matter, since we figured no one was being hit with late forfeits anyways. I wasnt feeling subtle exactly at this point. I again went first in this game, with Ellie favouring the 4 hobbit start of Pip, Merry, Sam and Frodo as opposed to my Boromir, Merry and Frodo start. I ran to site 3 in this game for the first time, hoping to encounter a lack of minions which fortunately for me, I did. As far as my shadow side went, the invincible Nelya came down with his lightsaber and I made him fierce (exerting that guy to make another Nazgul fierce) to cause some serious +1 damage to Ellie&#39;s poor fellowship. A couple of hobbits died as a result, and it placed me in a fairly strong position for the remainder of the game, as her fellowship came under siege. I stayed a site ahead for the remainder of the game, before I took a gamble at site 6 and moved twice to site 8, hoping to sacrifice a couple of guys at 8, then take my opponents lack of twilight, plus the 4 hobbit stealth&#39;s I had in hand to victory. As it happened, I got extremely lucky, and Ellie struggled to find minions to hit me with, so site 9 was a walkover.<br>
<br>
Full Win (1-2)<br>
<br>
Game 4 vs some guy who beat me last tourney<br>
Figuring I had nothing to lose being 1-2 for the day, I took a much more aggressive approach to game 4, trying to sucker my opponent in many ways into making moves they usually wouldnt do, and in essence, my ploy worked for the better percentage of the game. He started with the 4 hobbits again, and he also bid 0 which somewhat muddled my thinking, as since we had the same sites, there was no advantage to be had, minus the ability to control the tempo of the game I suppose. I began the game running, and forced my opponent to follow me through to site 5, which hampered me I knew, but with the Sauron Orcs I had in hand, I figured it would hamper him more. My calculated risk worked out, as I managed to keep Boromir, Sam and Frodo alive through site 6 to heal them where I stopped, whereas his fellowship was down to Sam and Frodo. I moved through to site 7 somewhat uninhibited, and pondered a move through to site 8. Thinking for a minute, I made the move to site 8 hoping that he had a small minion group to hit me with, so I could move onto site 9 next turn with two fellowship to sacrifice, and a Bounder to win the game. My opponent had no minions, and I strolled home to site 9 with Boromir, Sam and Frodo intact at the end.<br>
<br>
Full Win (2-2)<br>
<br>
Game 5 vs Ben Roberts<br>
I knew Ben from old Star Trek days, so it was always going to be a good laugh playing him. Many discussions came as a result of this game, such as the prospects of Sean Connery playing Sam or even Smeagol in the movie trilogy, which in turn produced Sean Connery impressions of &quot;Shire, Baggins&quot; and &quot;Not on my life Mr. Frodo, my name is Samwise Gamgee...&quot;. It was a good laugh to say the least, and as I said at the time, quite possibly &quot;the loudest game of Lord Of The Rings ever played&quot;. Ben is also a fairly strong LOTR player, having finished 1st and 2nd in the past couple of tourneys, so I knew I was in many ways outmatched from the beginning. I ran through to site 5 before I lost Boromir to a couple of Orcs, at which point my entire game fell apart and I struggled from there on in. From that point on, I found it very difficult to cycle cards out of my hand and to draw, which resulted in a lack of minions and an easy path for Ben to site 9. At site 8, I lost a hobbit or two, and with 2 fellowship and Ben at site 7 with a 4/5 member fellowship looking for an easy win, I took a risk and moved onto site 9 anyways, with 2 minions already to face. Frodo was bent over and viciously cloberd by a bunch of Sauron Orcs, and that was game.<br>
<br>
Full Loss (2-3)<br>
<br>
So I finished 2-3, finishing like, 12th to 14th out of 17th, which wasnt bad I guess, though disappointing that of the three games I lost, I probably could have won 2 of them, had I thought through my decisions properly and played the game as it should have been played. As it happens, I dont particularly care anyways, I had a good time, and I was just as happy anyways. Plus I got to work the Australian cricket team work some magic and beat the crap out of South Africa, even if it ended up as a dead rubber essentially (see www.baggygreen.com.au if you have no idea what I just said). Onto the usual props and slops....<br>
<br>
The World Famous Props and Slops <br>
-------------------------------- <br>
Props :<br>
Bounder - For being the one hobbit tank that won or loss countless games. We salute you.<br>
Leigh - For being able to admit that the real reason you were 30 minutes late was because you were opening a box of cards. I would have lied, personally.<br>

<br>
Slops :<br>
New Zealand Cricket - Period.<br>
Bounder - For being the one hobbit tank that won or loss countless games. Piece of crap.<br>
Hobbit Party Guest - What the hell use is this card in sealed? Are there any actual site 1 allies in the deck?<br>

<br>

Paul Dempsey from the band &#39;Something For Kate&#39; - For doing the best, kick hiney cover of &#39;Genie In A Bottle&#39; on the acoustic guitar. Kids, check it out if you can get the mp3, I think its great.<br>

&#39;Do you know the Mackin man??&#39;<br>
<br>
Theory Of The Week <br>
Belongs to sealed tournament winner Tim Reed, who decided that the Nazgul that approached a resident of the Shire and stated &quot;Shire....Baggins&quot;, actually was suffering from a slight cold, and minutes later was heard to proclaim &quot;Yes, mmm, could I get a cup of tea with that please?&quot; in the thickest British accent you could imagine. <br>
<br>
-Sean &quot;No really, Im not a hobbit, Im just short and hairy&quot; Mackin <br>
<br>
P.S Im currently taking donations of cards. Im chasing as many copies of &quot;The One Ring - The Ruling Ring&quot; (thats right, the common one) as possible. Im currently at 21 copies, and Im trying to obtain an insane amount so if anyone has copies they would like to rid themselves of, let me know either through d-mail or email at sjaussie@hotmail.com. Thanks folks.  <br></font></blockquote><BR><font face="  Times, Times New Roman, serif" class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3328&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font face="  Times, Times New Roman, serif" class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font face="  Times, Times New Roman, serif" class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
