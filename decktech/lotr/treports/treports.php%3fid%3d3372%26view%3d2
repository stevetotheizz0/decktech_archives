My brother, Caleb, got me into the game by giving me a starter for Christmas. Curse him! I&#39;ve since dumped about $30 into the game, and I&#39;m hoping to keep my spending at a minimum. Anyway, I had a collection consisting of maybe 20 rares at the tournament&#39;s outset, about half of which were in my deck. Caleb and his wife, Amanda, made the trip north from Winona, MN, and our cousin, Isaac, drove south from Moose Lake. Amanda was going to play, but she decided to shop for an interview-quality suit instead.<br>
<br>
I&#39;d managed to trade some MECCG cards for LotR cards with a local player and had acquired the rare Boromir that way. The rare Boromir helped my deck immensely since I was playing a Boromir / Merry deck with Twilight denial: No Stranger and Talent for Not Being Seen. My hazards (yeah, I mean Shadow, but I&#39;ve played MECCG so long, you see…) were a mix of Sauron and Nazgul cultures, and Morgul Skulkers were the lynchpin. I used Under the Watching Eye, Black Breath, Blade Tips and Hates for nasty direct damage.<br>
<br>
Game 1:<br>
I paired up against someone (I forgot his name, but let&#39;s call him &quot;Brian&quot; since that might be right) who was playing Dwarves and Uruk-hai. I bid 0 to start, which I did all day long, so he went first. He had played in some previous LotR tourneys, but he wasn&#39;t an experienced gamer and was making a number of mental mistakes. I let him take back as many actions as he wanted, but he just as often refused to take something back even when I offered, chastising himself and declaring that he simply had to learn. Whatever. Anyway, by site 2 or 3, one of his dwaves had already taken 2 wounds and a Black Breath. I moved on with little early resistance since he couldn&#39;t play much against my low twilight pool. Somewhere around Rivendell or site 4, he played out two more Dwarf puds and gave me a ton of twilight on his movement. I played two fierce Nazgul, and three of his characters died. Meanwhile, my guys were just jogging along, swatting down the few Uruk-hai he could afford. On his turn, left with only Gimli and Frodo, Brian had to exert Gimli for a Watching Eye. More Nazgul came to play, Gimli died, and Frodo was overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
As an additional note, I was unfamiliar with the timing and hadn&#39;t heard that the 5 minute warning and only, suddenly, knew that time had been called while I was at site 7, and he was just beginning the movement on his final turn. So it was a fortuitous matter that I had been able to overwhelm Frodo that very turn.<br>
<br>
Isaac lost his first game, and I heard a bit of an uproar as some upstart had apparently managed to beat a guy, Manuel, who had dominated the local scene, going undefeated since the new year. That unheralded someone was my brother.<br>
<br>
Game 2:<br>
This round saw my 20 or so rares pitted against the guy with the giant tackle box of extra cards. Yeah, he started Arwen and Legolas, Greenleaf, and I thought that would be pretty bad for me. Anyway, his name was Steve, and he was the co-owner of the store, so I guess it makes sense that he should have one of those exhaustive collections. We started, and I bid 0 to his 3. Steve added a burden with the Prancing Pony&#39;s text to pull Aragorn, and he was thus at 4 burdens. Aragorn got his bow. I was concerned, but he moved to Weathertop, giving me enough twilight to play a couple of Nazgul. Aragorn and Legolas exhausted themselves to shoot down the Ringwraiths, and he moved again. Well, that was just dandy, because I had Ulaire Toldea who spotted 4 burdens and killed Aragorn and, then, Legolas. Steve just shook his head in disbelief.<br>
<br>
On my turns, I had to fend against the Goblin armies, backed by their Armories and the condition that discards 3 from hand to play a Moria orc from the discard. Early on, it wasn&#39;t much of a problem, but I had to slow my movements after Rivendell, going only 1 site most of the way.<br>
<br>
Steve gave Gwemegil to Arwen, which was a HUGE asset for him. Not only was he able to discard all his now-useless support for Aragorn and Legolas, but he was swatting down my feeble Nazgul with relative ease. I took small consolation in the fact that I managed to get out both of my Watching Eyes by site 6 or 7. I managed to play a combination of a Ringwraith and a tracker, once or twice, but Frodo was able to cancel (with the rare Ring… this was important) each time and, thus, moved on.<br>
<br>
I got to site 8, twice surviving onslaughts with 3 orcs stacked against Frodo. All the Stealths and Intuitions in my deck had shown up at the right times, however, and he wasn&#39;t able to overwhelm the stout and sneaky Hobbit. Steve saw me at site 8, while starting from his own site 7 and felt pressured to double move. Under the Watching Eye taxed out his company, and I managed to play enough creatures to make Frodo face a tracker while the Ringbearer was maxed out at 3 wounds and 8 burdens. Arwen was invincible, but preoccupied with a Nazgul, she couldn&#39;t prevent Frodo from dying.<br>
<br>
My brother lost his game. I never got the full story. Isaac lost, too. Oh, well.<br>
<br>
At this point, both of the &quot;top&quot; players, Manuel and Mitch, had suffered losses, and the typical tournament debates and braggadocio started up. Several people I didn&#39;t know, Manuel among them, were claiming that they&#39;d come back to win. Whatever. I&#39;d already won two more games than I&#39;d expected, so I was happy.<br>
<br>
Game 3:<br>
Yeah, so I was visiting with my brother and cousin as much as possible and didn&#39;t really catch names. Sorry.<br>
<br>
This game was against some guy who started the rare Gimli and Legolas (I think Legolas was his 2nd character) and then got out all these other rares I didn&#39;t know about: Elrond, Bilbo, Stone Trolls, Gimli&#39;s Battle Axe, etc., etc. By site four or five Gimli was super-uber-huge and, with his Helm, was guaranteed to survive his next skirmish. However, he&#39;d been exhausted for 2 Delvings, and, even though he was ready for all my Nazgul, he was surprised by the ferocity of Sauron&#39;s Orcs&#39; Hate. The loss of Gimli crippled his company, forcing him to slow down.<br>
<br>
He was playing Sauron culture, himself, but wasn&#39;t able to draw enough minions to pound my company or even to exert for Watching Eyes and Archers. So, I just kept running ahead, and by site nine, the only minions he had to play against me were three trackers from his discard. Aragorn, Boromir and Merry dealt with those handily while Frodo watched from behind a tree trunk.<br>
<br>
Now, with three wins, I began to think that I could win the tournament, but I wasn&#39;t counting on it. Still, I read that Jim Li had won the first LotR CCG tournament he&#39;d entered, so I felt that I ought to be able to match the feat. After all, not only was I a comparable Star Wars player, but I had a wealth of experience with Middle Earth CCG, even winning the 2001 North American Championships in Montreal. (Yeah, I&#39;m pretty good at MECCG, but LotR is a totally different game… Aragorn goes from being Da Man With The Target On His Back in MECCG to being Da Man Who Uses Athelas About Two-And-A-Half Books Early in the movie and LotR CCG. And why can Boromir use Athelas? Yeah… He was a healer… Uh-huh… Anyway…)<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know how my brother&#39;s done at this point because when the pairings are called by brain just hears, &quot;Isaac wins round four.&quot; Too bad. Isaac gets the bye. But I play the only other undefeated player (I&#39;ll call him Big Red because he had a long, red ponytail and stood 6-foot, Up-There-inches tall). Big Red tells me that he had a modified win, but it really doesn&#39;t matter; between the two of us, whoever wins will take first.<br>
<br>
I bid zero all day, so I go second. Big Red bids low but enough to win the chance to start Famer Maggot&#39;s Fields or whatever allows him to exert to get Merry and Pippin. I start Aragorn instead of Boromir, then, figuring I&#39;ll exert to get Merry. Big Red starts Gandalf. I figure that&#39;s bad for me since I&#39;m running so many events (3 Watching Eyes, 3 Blade Tips, 3 Black Breaths). I tell Big Red he&#39;s got a favorable match-up, and he shrugs it off.<br>
<br>
Of course, I WANT to go second because I then get to play Weatherhills and Ford of Bruinen as my sites. Some Nazgul come out early, and Gandalf suffers the plague (Black Breath).<br>
<br>
I move, and my sites turn into liabilities since Big Red is also playing Nazgul. I have a great opening hand, dropping a Ranger Sword to Aragorn, Hobbit Sword to Merry, and There and Back Again (foil) to Frodo, but I soon learn the game text of Ulaire Cantea when he&#39;s played against me-exert to discard a weapon the defending character is carrying. Yuck. Well, this is where I make a big mistake. I&#39;ve conditioned myself so much to thinking &quot;Protect Frodo at all costs!&quot; that the only choice in my mind is whether Merry or Aragorn loses his sword. Well, duh, Aragorn&#39;s more important, so Merry steps up to bat. Thinking that even though he&#39;ll lose the weapon&#39;s strength bonus, he&#39;ll be a 5 (yeah, that&#39;s accounting for his +2 while holding a weapon), I discard There and Back Again to pump him…. Getting him up to a 5 against Cantea&#39;s 10 after Cantea exerts. So Merry is overwhelmed, and I only have the Promo Aragorn. Frodo is vulnerable.<br>

But Big Red&#39;s Gandalf has seen better days. We trade turns, with neither of us willing to move more than one site at a time, hoping and praying for supporting characters. Big Red&#39;s Boromir comes out, and two sites later, Boromir dies. Gandalf has three wounds on him, but I have to move to site 5 with only Aragorn and Frodo. Two Nazgul catch them at the Bridge (Don&#39;t ask me what Ringwraiths were doing deep in Moria… I don&#39;t know.). Aragorn can survive his, but Frodo can&#39;t. The Hobbit dies, and Sauron recovers his Ruling Ring and, well, can not be overcome. All of Middle Earth is his. I lose.<br>
<br>
Big Red played a great game, and apart from my mental error with Merry, I had fun and thought I played well. Give me another 20 rares, I say, and I should be a contender.<br>
<br>
My brother ended up going 2 - 2. Isaac managed to play a game against Steve after Steve finished his last round, so Ike didn&#39;t have to sit around too long.<br>
<br>
Big Red won, of course, and I was in a massive, unresolved tie for second (four players). In my prize support, I pulled an Elrond and a foil Bilbo which I traded with Manuel for a Witch-King and Glamdring. I had a Glamdring already, somehow, so I&#39;m trying to get another two Legolas, Greenleaves, (and 2 or 3 Aragorn&#39;s Bows) I guess, to do the whole Target Archery thing…<br>
<br>
Rebecca and Amanda show up shortly after the tournament ends, so Caleb, Isaac and I never have our chance for a multi-player game. But we all had fun, so there&#39;ll be another time.<br>
