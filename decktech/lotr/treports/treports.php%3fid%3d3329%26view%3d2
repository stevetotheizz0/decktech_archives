I woke up at a decent hour, got my gear together and boarded the train to the city.  Arriving at 12:30, well before even the Tournament Director had, I sat down and watched some Magi Nation game until everyone began showing up.  By 1:00, the TD and players had all arrived prompting sign ups to begin.  The first match started at 2PM.  One a side note, this was my first LOTR tournament, let alone the first time my deck had seen an serious play.  I used a Gondor/Shire Moria deck which only real weaknesses were lack of cards which I didn&#39;t have access too.  I started the common ring, rare Frodo, rare Boromir and common Merry.<br>
<br>
Game 1:  Rob with Sauron/Nazgul<br>
<br>
I bid 1 fearing Nazgul sword and he bids 0.  I play the Prancing Pony, pull Aragorn bringing it up to 2 burdens and lay down a Hobbit Sword on Merry and a Ranger&#39;s Sword on Aragorn.  Move to site 2, Bree Streets, and face a Nazgul.  Merry avoids one attack with Hobbit Stealth and Boromir blocks the other taking a wound.  I stop moving.  Rob lays down a Gimli&#39;s Axe, Helm an Elven Bow on Arwen and Gandalf.  Moves to site 2, I layed down a Goblin Armory and Goblin Swarms, but hold off on the minions.  He double jumps to site 3 where I lay down to orcs with 2 scimtars to get some cycling going.  One is killed by Gimli, the other wounds Arwen and goes on Goblin Swarms.  On my turn, I move to site 3, play a Gaffer, Sting, Blade of Gondor, a Talent For Not Being Seen and a No Stranger To The Shadows.  I Sting him before I move, getting rid of the twilight I just added.  With only 4 twilight in the pool after I move, he has nothing to do.  I stop moving.  I think Legolas came out on his next turn, then he moves to site 4.  I get the full swarm engine going laying down a runner, a scout, a scavengers, pull the scimtar from graveyard, draw, lay down a backstabber, and somehow a cave troll managed to make his way in there.  Some heavy wounding.  The game continues on like this till site 6 where the downfall occurs.  For some reason, he doesn&#39;t stop at the sanctuary to heal at site 6 and double move sto 7.  A rather large swarm accompanied by the cave troll moves in for the kill.  I take the win.  <br>
<br>
FW (3pts)<br>
<br>
Good:  Keeping the twilight really low with Sting so almost nothing got played and his hand was stifled.<br>
Bad:  Not being able to kill him in Moria.<br>
Ugly:  Rob not stopping at site 6 to heal.  He most likely could have won.<br>
<br>
Game 2:  Mike with Ranger/Uruk Hai<br>
<br>
I bid 1 he bids 3.  Mike starts Arwen and Sam with the rare Frodo and common ring.  He chooses to go first putting out the Pony and pulling aragorn.  Then, proceeds to play more possessions than I can remember decking out everyone on the board with their gear.  Then plays pathfinder, bringing out his Bree Gate, moves, I play a couple of Orcs which are very quickly swatted down, moves again, I hold off trying to gather enough forces for Moria, then he triple moves from Bree Gate&#39;s site text coming to my site 4, Mithril Mine.  I start the swarm engine, dealing some wounds to his characters but nothing significant.  On my turn I pull Aragorn, lay out his bow, Sting, Blade of Gondor and Armor on Boromir.  Move to site two, a small Uruk Hai comes out.  Having to double move to keep up with Mike, move to site three another Uruk Hai, Boromir pulls through with his armor.  Things went like this for the next few moves.  I don&#39;t go into much detail because I can&#39;t really remember what I played since it was so much.  I layed out as many minions as the swarm allowed, but I just couldn&#39;t stop him with Aragorns bow at his disposal and no Goblin Armory coming my way.  The end of the match was rather eventful though.  Time was about to be called and he had just double moved to site 9, I layed down 2 Goblin Runners, 2 Scavengers, 1 Moria Scout, 1 Goblin Backstabber, 1 Troll&#39;s Keyward and the Cave Troll with is Hammer.  It was impressive to look at.  Time is called and we get to finish to his regroup phase.  It was cool to look out, but without Goblin Armory, a fully healed Aragorn and bow mowed down the competition.  If i just had one armory out, I would have been able to overwhelm him.  He survives and take the win.<br>
FL (1pt) 4pts total<br>
<br>
Game 3:  Jason Robinette, the TD playing someone elses      <br>
         Gandalf/Uruk Hai Deck.<br>
<br>
This match was pretty uneventful.  I bid 1, he bids 0.  I play the pony and pull Aragorn, lay down Sting, Blade of Gondor and Ranger&#39;s Sword.  He starts Gimli and Legolas, plays rare Gandalf and pulls Aragorn.  Sting keeps me free of enemies and his hand is pretty stifled.  I have an insane hand including 4 minions, Cave Troll with hammer, Goblin Swarms and a scimtar.  He lays out Glamdring and uses it to see the hand of death.  From then on we both move one at a time, me fighting 1 or 2 Uruk Hai on the way, him trying to postpone going underground for as long as possible and getting some good draws.  I should have gone second since he also plays the pony as his first site, but unfortunately, moved to his above ground site 4 being the Pass of Caradhras.  He then moves to site 4, I unleash the swarm minus the Cave Troll and some heavy wounding take place.  I move to site 5, handle some Uruk Hai.  He finally has to go underground and at site 5 faces the Cave Troll with hammer along with 5 minions and sporting a few Goblin Scimtars.  Frodo is overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
FW (3pts) 7pts total<br>
<br>
Good:  Getting the kill in Moria<br>
Bad: Going first when pulling Aragorn was not neccessary<br>
     and moving to an above ground site 4<br>
Ugly: Jason, who was obviously a top notch player using<br>
      someone elses deck which was not very good.<br>
<br>
Game 4:  Tim with Elf/Nazgul<br>
<br>
Tim was Mike&#39;s son and about 8 years old.  I was amazed that he knew how to play the game so well for his age.  With practice he could become an amazing player.  The only drawback was that he had a really low attention span and I had to keep reminding him that we were playing and needed to play and not talk about other stuff since the game was timed.  I bid 1, he bids 0.  I go first and pull Aragorn, lay out some possessions, move to Bree Streets, face a Nazgul and take two wounds.  Tim goes, starting common Frodo, common ring, Arwen and uncommon Legolas, lays out his archer madness setup with Rumil, Orophin, Elven Bows, splendor of their banners.  Moves to site 2, I hold off on playing anything.  Things continue on like this for the next few turns, him continually beefing up his archery support, Haldir comes out, Asphaloth on Arwen, Double Shots against some straggling orcs I play and me facing some Nazgul and taking a few wounds.  My Merry and Boromir are killed in the fray, but my real assault begins in Moria and and doesn&#39;t stop.  Tim is finally overwhelmed despite all his archery support when he reaches site 6 by my Cave Troll with hammer and a few buddies.  The fellowship archery total was reaching 7 or so but i still managed to get enough orcs in there to withstand it all.<br>
<br>
FW (3pts) 10 pts total<br>
<br>
Good: Overwhelming Frodo despite the staggering fellowship<br>
      archery total.<br>
Bad: Not drawing any Goblin Armory, which would have helped<br>
     a lot and losing Merry and Boromir.<br>
Ugly: Having to repeatedly remind Tim that we needed to <br>
      play the game and not talk about which cards he has..<br>
<br>
Game 5:  George with Twilight Denial/Moria Swarm<br>
<br>
George was also playing a swarm deck and I feared being overhwhelmed too quickly, so I bid 2 to get Aragorn out ASAP and he bid 0.  Although in the process, and maybe sealing my fate, this would mean I would have to go through Moria first.  I pull Aragorn, lay down Sting, There and Back Again, Blade of Gondor and Bounder.  Move to Trollshaw Forest, George doesn&#39;t play anything.  I stop.  George is starting rare Frodo and rare Aragorn.  This was a true twilight denial deck.  He lays down a No Stranger to the Shadows and moves.  I get 2 twilight to work with.  I play a Goblin Swarms and he stops moving.  My hand is building up a decent attack but I&#39;m still going through Moria first.<br>
I play an Ranger&#39;s Sword, draw from Trollshaw, Sting him to get rid of 1 twilight and move to his site 3, Rivendell Waterfall.  A Goblin Swarms and They are coming followed by a Goblin Runner with Goblin Scimtar comes out which Boromir kills.  I stop.  He plays Aragorn&#39;s Bow, Coat of Mail on Aragorn and moves to site 3, I play a Goblin Armory.  He stops moving.  My hand is built of pretty well but I&#39;m still going to Moria first. I don&#39;t play anything and move to Moria Stairway.  The cycling begins and 2 Goblin Runners, 2 Goblin Scavengers with Scimtars, and The Cave Troll makes an appearance. Aragorn takes 2 wounds, Boromir takes 2 wounds, Merry dies while Frodo puts on the ring and takes a burden for blocking the two runners.  I stop.  He moves to site 4 and I let go with 2 Goblin Runners, Troll&#39;s Keyward and the Cave Troll himself.  Aragorn&#39;s Bow kills the 2 runners, Aragorn Frodo cancels a skirmish with the troll from Hobbit Stealth, Aragorn kills the keyward then take 2 wounds from the troll.  It continues on like this, me barely escapind death and him him using Aragorn&#39;s Bow to it&#39;s fullest effect until I am forced to move to site 6.  A lot of orcs came out and it was a valiant effort with Frodo accompanied by Sting and pumped of from There and Back Again plus given the Bounder&#39;s skirmish ability, but he was still overwhelmed.  The moral of the story.  I need more Power According to His Stature, only 1 in the deck.<br>
<br>
Good: Lasting as long as I did<br>
Bad: No Power According to his Stature<br>
Ugly: Going first, even though I needed Aragorn to help<br>
      block, ensuring me facing the swarm first.  A lose <br>
      lose situation.<br>

I place third, with George making first and Mike coming in second.  Prizes were only for 1st and 2nd though, with a rare foil to first and uncommon foil to second.  All in all, I had a lot of fun.  I&#39;d say I did pretty well for my first tournament, and met some really great people.  The Tournament Director, Jason Robinette was a really nice guy and gave me some great pointers.  George&#39;s twilight denial setup was rather amazing.  I might have even come in first if I had more PATHS and Goblin Armory to put in my deck. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font face="  Times, Times New Roman, serif" class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3329&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font face="  Times, Times New Roman, serif" class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font face="  Times, Times New Roman, serif" class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
