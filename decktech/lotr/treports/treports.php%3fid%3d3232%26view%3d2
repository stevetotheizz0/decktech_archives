I would first like to star off by saying that I am a Star Wars fan.  I played the game and at one time was even ranked in the top 50 in the world.  I take pride in that game and I am sad to see it fall by the wayside.  I am grateful that the tournament directors here in Utah are still holding tournaments and that there are enough of us left to make them sanctioned.  I think it was one of the greatest games ever, and I will miss it.  As for Decipher, I bear them no ill will.  Neither am I upset with Lucas/Lucasfilm for their decision.  My life will continue and hopefully I will meet many of you as I travel the globe to play this game of LOTR.  That having been said, here is my first tournament report.<br>
<br>
Bear with me as it was in November and now it is January.<br>
<br>
I haven&#39;t yet played in a sanctioned tournament.  I didn&#39;t get wind of the Chase the Ring tournament until after it was over.  I&#39;ve been out of a job for about 3 months now and I have no money to sink into a new card game.  With the trailing off of Star Wars, everyone seems to be getting into Lord of the Rings.  I wish I could, but I have no money and so I pay it no heed.  A group from one of the shops around here has an idea on how to get in to the game without spending alot of money.  They start out with a starter and 7 booster packs, and then every week they buy an additional 3 packs.  They only trade with themselves to keep the card pool high.  This is an interesting idea and it sounds like fun.  I have not even enough money to do this, but my friend said that if I wanted to get in, he would buy my packs up until the end of December as a Christmas present.  I said that would be fine.  So we go and get our packs, the &quot;clover club&quot; had been going for about 4 weeks already and so we got in with a starter and 16 booster packs.  For most games, this wouldn&#39;t even allow you to even think you had a chance of winning.  You wouldn&#39;t believe how hard it is to get commons in a fixed card base environment, so since I don&#39;t feel prepared enough to play my own deck, I decide to borrow my friend Eric&#39;s Gandalf/Moria orc deck.  Its the deck I&#39;ve been playing for a while and I like it and think thats what I want my deck to be.<br>
<br>
So the night before we&#39;re playing at my friend Hag&#39;s house and I&#39;m pretty much winning against everyone (a good sign I hope).  The only deck that seems to give me problems is Tyler&#39;s Sauron Orc deck.  It almost always kills my fellowship every time.  At about 4:00AM we decide its time to leave so that we can get some sleep.  Nathan and I leave while Hag stays up all night playing football. We make plans to meet back at around 11:00 as the tourney starts at 12:00.<br>
<br>
Nathan shows up at my place at 10:45 and we head over to Hag&#39;s to car pool up to the tourney.  We get there and Brandon and Ty said that they wanted to come too.  We didn&#39;t plan on this, but the more the merrier.  So we all pile into the Jeep and head up to Bountiful.  Its about a 35 minute drive and we get there with about 10 minutes to spare.  Joe, one of the local riders, is standing outside having a smoke and he nearly jumps out of his skin when we pull up (apparently he had lost hope that it was going to be a sanctioned tournament).  <br>
<br>
We show up with 5 guys and there were 5 there and so now we have enought for a sanctioned tournament.  10 is a great number for a tournament, especially for how new the game is.  Here we go.<br>
<br>
Despite the fact that the game has only been around for about 2 months, I already have a double rating.  Me (1581) & (1557) See slops<br>
<br>
Game 1:  Me vs. Tyler Anderson&#39;s (1644) Hobbit/Sauron Madness<br>
<br>
So we drive all the way up here just to play each other first.  Not only that, but this is the one deck I&#39;m afraid of.  He&#39;s killed Frodo more times than I can remember.  So I let him go first with a bid of 4 (I think).  He starts with Merry and Borimir, Lord of Gondor.  I forget what his first site is, I think it was to get Sam, which is good, because I get to go get mine too.  He moves and there really isn&#39;t anything that keeps him from getting to the sanctuary relatively easily.  I on the other hand have a few more problems as he puts out 3 orc bowmen early and I&#39;m hurting pretty badly.  He moves to site 4 and I look at him in disgust as I say that I have nothing for him there, whatever look I gave him was enough to do it.  He moves on to the next site, the bridge, and gives me a whole lot of tokens.  Looks like those acting classes in high school paid off, I throw down about 9 guys with the help of Host of 1000&#39;s and They are coming.  Frodo is easily overwhelmed and I move on to face my next opponent.  What made him even madder was when I told him that he probably would have killed me if he had just stopped at site 4.  <br>
<br>
FW (+3) Standing (+3)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning my first game in a sanctioned tournament.<br>
Lows: Having to win my first game in a sanctioned tournament against a friend that I drove there with.<br>
<br>
Well Hag won his game, as did Joe, Brandon and Nathan.  Joe beat the person he was playing so badly that he decided to leave.  I kinda felt bad for the kid, but if you can&#39;t take the heat, get out of the fire.  Pairings are called and I&#39;m playing Hag.  <br>
<br>
Game 2: Me vs. Hag&#39;s (1597) Lets kill Sam/Uruk-hai swarm<br>
<br>
Great!  Not only is my first game against someone I came up with, but so is my second as well.  Hag is playing Arwen/Rangers with No Stranger to the Shadows move for free deck.  I know that he is dependant on getting out Aragorn and so I bid high, I think 6 to ensure that he won&#39;t get Aragorn anytime soon.  We begin and I get Sam and Gandalf out and move to site 2.  He throws down 3 Uruk-hai and even though I win my battles, it still only kill one of them.  So I opt not to move on.  He blows through my guys and easily reaches the sanctuary, killin sacrificial Sam in the process.  Thats his plan, get rid of burdens and then kill Sam.  Kinda brutal, but it seems to work for him.  He didn&#39;t get out Aragorn and so I&#39;m expecting him to come out at the next site.  I move to site 3 with ease, and want to heal sam before moving on.  I also want him to move to my site 4 because thats where my guys are brutal.  His turn he throws down Aragorn with 2 No Strangers and moves to my site 4, giving me 8 tokens to work with.  My hand is really good and I&#39;m able to throw down 8 guys with those 8 tokes.  Free scouts, runners, backstabbers and weapons to draw more.  I thank Arwen for being an elf and proceed to beat the crap out of Frodo.  He can&#39;t believe that I threw down 8 guys with only 8 shadow tokens.  Hag&#39;s seeing red, and I come away with the win.<br>
<br>
FW (+3) Standing (+6)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Once again killing Frodo and getting the win.  Having a god-draw on site 4.<br>
Lows:  Once again killing Frodo and winning against someone I drove up with, is there anyone else at this tournament?<br>
<br>
So now I&#39;m undefeated and feeling pretty confident in my deck.  Nathan and Brandon both won their last games and so there are 3 of us still undefeated.  I wonder if I will play one of them or actually get someone else to play against whose deck I don&#39;t know.  Since Ty got the bye he went to the gas station to get a drink before the next round.  The attendant apparently hit on him.  Normaly this would be fine, except the attendant was a guy.  I nearly died laughing!.  Ty didn&#39;t think it was as funny as I did.  The pairings are called for the next round and Nathan is playing Brandon.  So I get paired up against Joe.<br>
<br>
Game 3: Me vs. Joe&#39;s (1614) Fellowship from Hell/Nazgul to match<br>
<br>
So I&#39;m expecting to have a really good game, even though Joe just lost to Nathan.  The details of this game are a little fuzzy as it was really long and over a month ago when it was played.  All I remember is I fell behind when I wasn&#39;t able to make it to the bridge first.  He was losing characters left and right to my Moria Swarm, but I was still unable to kill Frodo for some stupid reason.  He had everyone in the deck.  Gimli, Gandalf, Sam, Arwen (who was the first to die), Legolas (who was 2nd), Aragorn and Borimir (who was 3rd).  all these people and matching weapons makes for some Moria dead, but he was losing characters too.  He beat me to the sanctuary site 6 and I knew then that I wasn&#39;t going to catch him through his Nazgul.  They&#39;re just too big for my Fellowship to handle more that one site at a time.  I finally get a double move on him when I head out to the Bridge and then on to the sanctuary, but it wasn&#39;t enough to catch him.  He makes it out to site 9 first and I get my last opportunity to kill Frodo.  I&#39;m throwing guys out left and right hoping to get enough to overwhelm him when I get down to the last two cards in my hand.  He has a Fellowship of 4 and I&#39;ve thrown out 5 guys.  All I need is one more guy and I&#39;ll kill Frodo.  Because one of the two cards in my hand isn&#39;t an orc, and because I can&#39;t draw one more card to loose 3 for They are Coming, I lose and he beats me to site 9.  I did kill everyone in his fellowship though.  But that doesn&#39;t matter if Frodo lives.  Which he did, and I lost.<br>
<br>
FL (+1)   Standing (+7)<br>
<br>
So now I&#39;m sitting at 2-1, looking for blood vengance from that close last game.  Nathan is the only undefeated player and so I know that if I don&#39;t take him down, nobody will.  I hope they call pairings allowing me to play him.  Pairings are called, and I&#39;m not playing him, but Brandon??  How is that possible since Brandon got the bye last round and has a loss??  I ask Miah, the TD, to check that and he see&#39;s that he is wrong and that I should be playing Nathan.  Phew, thought I wasn&#39;t going to get my shot there for a minute.  So this is the last game, and my last chance at 1st place.<br>
<br>
Game 4:  Me vs. Nathan&#39;s (1609)  I&#39;m the King Aragorn/Uruk-hai Mayhem<br>
<br>
Nathan is my friend and he rode up with us as well.  Funny how all of the top players rode in the same car together.  Nathan is playing Aragorn/Legolas/Borimir gonna stomp on some Moria Orcs deck.  I know that he needs the Pony to start cause he only has 2 Aragorns in his deck, so I bid high and get to start off.  He was having a horrible draw, I saw one Uruk-hai on my way to site 3.  Saw only 2 more as I went from 3 to 5 and then only at site 8 and 9 did he even throw anything huge out.  With that it was really easy, all I had to do was stop him from going faster than I was.  It worked and I easily walked into site 9 only having lost one companion, Borimir, who really isn&#39;t a key at all to my deck.  He just had a horrible draw and I took advantage of it as I didn&#39;t and had a really good draw.  He moved slowly and I went really fast.  I wish there was something more I could say about this game, but there really isn&#39;t.  So I won.<br>
<br>
FW (+3)   Standing (+10)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Beating the guy who had demolished everyone else already today.<br>
Lows:  The game not being that great and having it happen to my friend.  <br>
<br>
As it were, there were 3 guys who had a finishing of (+10).  Myself, Nathan, and Joe.  The way it was figured out was like this.<br>
<br>
Nathan beat Joe<br>
Joe beat me<br>
I beat Nathan<br>
<br>
Here is what was decided for the final:<br>
<br>
1.  Nathan (+10)<br>
2.  Me (+10) Even though I beat #1<br>
3.  Joe (+10) Even though he beat me at #2<br>
4.  Hag (+7) Stupid bye<br>
<br>
So my first tournament was a lot of fun.  I can&#39;t wait to play again, especially since the Chase the Can is coming up and I&#39;m one of Deciphers Best for having won YJ states last year.  I would&#39;ve won Star Wars too, but I was running it.  <br>
