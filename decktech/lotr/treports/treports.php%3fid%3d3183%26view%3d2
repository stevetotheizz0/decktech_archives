Me and My friend Wesley &quot;Evil&quot; Addison share a collection, and we finally got our 4th Servant of the Secret Fire off ebay, so the deck was pretty much made. We couldn&#39;t get enough Arwens for us both to play her, so I played Gimli x2 and his axe instead of her and her sword. Gimli worked out great, and made Gandalf as big as he could possibly be sometimes. I think Gimli might be better in this deck except against Nazgul, because he seems to be the better fighter, often time being damage +2 and able to go large when needed. I also threw in the rare Merry at the last second because that nut always seems to find his way into my decks. <br>
<br>
For Shadow I was playing a Uruk-hai non-snow deck. It was decent but not as focused as I would have liked it to be. I got all the cards I needed it for it, but if I could go back and change the deck I would replace the 4 bred for battles I played with 4 Savagery to Match Their Numbers because archery was everywhere and I hardly ever got to use bred for battle except on troops, and with those guys +2 might as well be the same as +3. I&#39;d also drop the 2 Orthanc Assassins I was playing and play Lurtz number 3 and 4. Lurtz was amazing all day.<br>
<br>
Anyway, on to the actual tournament. The format was 4 rounds of Chase the Can where you bring 4 cans of food and every time you win you get a can from to guy you beat and vice versa. Also the TD went around every round and put a Decipher&#39;s Best sticker on a random can, and that can was worth 2 packs at the end of the day. All the other cans were worth one pack. This was loads of fun and for a great cause, so props to decipher and every TD who participated in this.<br>
<br>
Round 1 - Vs. Wesley Addison - Arwen & Legolas / Ringwraiths<br>
<br>
I have to play the guy I share cards with first round, so that is no fun. I start Gandalf and he starts Arwen and Legolas. I bid 2 and he bid 1 so I had him go first so I would not have to go through the Ford at site 3. We pretty much do nothing early on with him playing a couple Nazgul at sites 2 and 3 and me doing much of nothing. We are both pretty much completely healed when we get to site 4 (which is pretty much always the case it seems). I start trying to get some wounds on him at site 5 and try and use Spies of Saruman to get around his archery. I&#39;m down to Gandalf and Frodo at site 8 because he has been pounding me with Ringwraiths (that sounded bad didn&#39;t it). It&#39;s his turn and he moves to site 8 with Legolas, Aragorn, Frodo, and Arwen all still alive but pretty hurt. I put down a troop and something else and put a hurt on him, and time is called. Wesley want their to be clear cut winner so he runs to site 9 knowing he will probably die. He does indeed die as I play about 4 Uruk-hai and overwhelm Frodo. I&#39;m not sure what would have happened if I had moved to site 9, but I doubt I would have won, so props to Wesley for pretty much giving me that one.<br>
<br>
Highs - Not many.<br>
Lows - Played my friend.<br>
<br>
Record<br>
1-0<br>
<br>
Round 2 - Sean (I think) - Legolas & Arwen / Ringwraiths<br>
<br>
It&#39;s like De-ja-vu all over again. His Shadow half was not as rough as Wesley&#39;s had been because he played a ton of support cards and not enough minions it seemed. Often times I would have 1 massive Wraith to deal with instead of 2 pretty big ones. I had to face a really huge witch King like 3 times during the games, but Servant of the Secret Fire kept that probably from overwhelming me. At one point he had a Witch King with Black Steed and Pale Blade. That guy was huge. I lost 2 companions on that little exchange. I was never in trouble though, because I had decided to play 4 Barliman Butterburs the night before I had a massive amount of Servants of the Secret Fire always in hand. I had been putting a big hurt on him with the Troop of Uruk-hai - Lurtz Battle Cry combo plus the fact that there had not been an archery phase for 3 consecutive sites and he was pretty hurt when he got to site 8. I knew if I lived through my turn I could just play Lurtz and any other guy and kill everybody he had at site 9. I live through my turn pretty easily and then play a bunch of guys for cheap at my site 9 and easily overwhelm Frodo. So now I had played the same type of deck 2 rounds in a row, and won the same way 2 rounds in a row. Weird.<br>
<br>
Highs - Always felt in control. Won a decipher&#39;s best can.<br>
Lows - Realized I should have 4 Lurtz instead of the worthless Assassin.<br>
<br>
Record <br>
2-0<br>
<br>
Round 3 - Will - Merry & Boromir / Uruk-hai<br>
<br>
Will and my group of friends have had our fair share of disagreement in the past, and we have never really seen eye to eye, but today I was in a good mood, and he was in a good mood, so for the first time we mostly got along. We both bid 2 so we flipped a coin. I won the toss and had him play first so in case of Nazgul I wouldn&#39;t have to go through the ford. He starts Merry and Boromir and pulls Aragorn first turn. I have trouble doing anything because of cards like A Ranger&#39;s Versatility and other assorted Elves and their allies pretty much keeping me from doing anything. He wasn&#39;t really hurting me with his bad guys either, but mine couldn&#39;t even touch his. He had no trouble running a couple of times, and in the end he looked at my hand with something (Sting??) and knew he could run to site 9 no problem. I felt totally useless with my Shadow half this game, but thats how it goes sometimes.<br>
<br>
Highs - Will for being a nice opponent, and for showing me the power of Savagery to Match Their Numbers.<br>
Lows - Doing nothing with my Shadow Half.<br>
<br>
Record <br>
2-1<br>
<br>
Round 4 - Another Sean (I think) - Arwen & Legolas / Moria<br>
<br>
I&#39;m not saying that starting Arwen and Legolas is popular or anything, but everybody else is. His free peoples half looked solid, but Moria orcs is just not that good against a deck with as many companions as mine and Legolas, Greenleaf, Aragorn&#39;s Bow, Blade of Gondor, and Power According to His Stature. He was playing a bunch of cave Trolls though, so I did have to stop a couple of times and let that guy go away. Whenever he didn&#39;t play a Troll I would kill all his guys and run. I was a good bit ahead of him because I was playing enough Troop of Uruk-hai and Lurtz to keep him from chasing. Once I got to site 8 he played some orc and the Troll and possibly his hammer, I can&#39;t remember. I threw Merry and Gimli to the Troll and killed the other guy. I looked at his hand with Glamdring, and all he could play was 2 more minions so I ran. He played his 2 guys and I made Aragorn defender +2 and blocked all 3, then threw Gandalf in front of the Troll on his second pass. First time I&#39;ve won yet by making it to site 9.<br>
<br>
Highs - Decimating tons of Orcs in all sorts of manners.<br>
Lows - None.<br>
<br>
Record<br>
3-1<br>
<br>
I got 3rd place in the end, and my friend Trevor won. Will got second because his only loss was to Trevor in round 4. I had 5 regular cans and 1 decipher&#39;s best can so I got 7 packs which had some pretty good cards in it. Still have not opened an Arwen in 10 some odd boxes between my friends and I. All in all it was fun, and me and my group of players have won for the second straight week. I might play again this weekend, but it being the day before Christmas Eve might put a damper on that. It&#39;s not really worth the effort to write a props and slops for a local tournament, so I won&#39;t.<br>
