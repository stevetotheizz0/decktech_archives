Florida Con Quest Lord of The Rings Weekend Kissimmee Florida near Disney World<br>
<br>
Florida Conquest is a gaming convention for basically every game known to man. Star Wars, Magic, Lord of The Rings, Trek, Pokemon, Counterstrike, XBOX etc etc etc. They do everything at this con including some really wierd stuff.<br>
<br>
The LOTR schedule had a sealed MoM Friday night, me running a multiplayer Saturday night, and Smackdown 2002 constructed LOTR Sunday. Smackdown was the big enchilada with Foil Arwen, Frodo, Ring, and a signed Aragorn up for prizes.<br>
<br>
Justin &quot;Abdullah&quot; Alderman and I headed over Friday from Largo to Kissimmee. After negotiating Osceola county&#39;s brilliant toll booth system, getting a full tour of the town of Celebration, finding out that Highway 17/92 addresses go down to zero and then start up again after Main Street, we found the hotel and were still the first one&#39;s there, so we checked in and started watching Jaws 2. Cool.<br>
SHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRK!!! Neato.<br>
<br>
The main tournament report will be about the Sunday Smackdown but I will give you the sealed stuff in a nutshell. The friday night sealed was a mix of every kind of starter and pack available. I ended up with an Aragorn starter and 2 each of the boosters. Cool.<br>
<br>
My starter and packs contained about 12 dwarf cards and no dwarves, uh oh. I also got a cave trolls hammer and no troll, a Valiant Man of the west, and some other rare and proceeded to stick all of them with all of my useless dwarf cards, so I went 4 games without playing Valiant Man of The West in an Aragorn deck. Duh! However I went 4-0 in my games and won the tournament anyway. We had some new people there and the Urak Hai just wreak havoc in sealed. I could either move quickly or wait and swarm them with Uraks. I won a rare foil card as the prize for that one. A Glamdring! Nice<br>
<br>
Saturday was the Star Wars open. Since I retired from Star Wars, I don&#39;t care to much about it, but I did start watching some of the games because Abdullah was playing in it. He played Maul&#39;s Hutt and Watch Yo Step with zero new or virtual cards. Well sometimes old school is better since he took second, losing only 1 game to eventual winner David Irvine by 3 cards! Irvine took the open win and the big trophy. Great job guys!<br>
<br>
Saturday night was a mixture of whatever you felt like doing. LOTR sealed, Austin Powers, Ref 3 booster draft, or pickup games. We had 8 for sealed LOTR so we used all MoM. I got a Gandalf starter and went to town going 3-1 only losing to Mary Gail Coffee who had a great dwarf package. The Balrog came out every game and mostly with a spear on him but MG Coffee had dwarf guards all over the place and the Balrog could only garner a light snack :(	I gave out a bunch of packs as prizes and the tournament was only $10.00 so everyone got a lot of cards for the money. And let me tell you, these boxes had so many foils it was crazy. I can&#39;t even remeber them all. My deck had a foil Gandalfs staff. Nice!<br>
<br>
The Sunday Smackdown LOTR constructed was the jewel tourny of the weekend with mucho fat foils to the 1-2 players, a signed Viggo Morrtenson KIE, and a Polish Celeborn for 3-4. Not bad!<br>
<br>
Abdullah and I had When Hobbits Attack V 2.0/Merry Superstar ready to go. Our decks only differed by 2 cards. I used 2 Paths and he used 1 extra copy of Blade of Gondor and Flaming Brand. The PATHS would turn out to win me the tournament. My shadow differed from his using 3 trolls and 2 hammers and he used flankers.<br>
<br>
Game 1 Mike Blumberg (me) versus Tony Duncan Nazgul/Gandalf/ Elves/Aragorn<br>
<br>
I know Tony is a TD/Rider and has quite a few cards and it is the first game so the adrenaline is flowing. It gets worse as he wins the bid, plays a Nazgul at Weatherhills and I take a couple wounds. He drops a bunch of fellow stuff and I play a Cave Troll and do some good damage. I move to the Ford and he plays Ferny, Attea for 1 and gates out Nelya for 3! Nice huh? Well I had deployed Flaming Brand and proceeded to make Aragorn a 19 with Merry Superstar. Well Tony got rather excited and let out a few expletetives explaining his love for Flaming Brand. I think most of the words started with F.<br>
<br>
Tonys temper was getting the best of him as next turn I had deployed They Are Coming, Swarms , and 2 Armories. He knocked out the Armories with Dreary, and then tried to use Secret Sentinels to x out the other 2 but I explained that he didnt have an Elf Ally to exert. Oops. Tony turned red and said he should have read the card since he had no Allies in the deck to use it with.<br>
<br>
I cruised through Moria without much trouble with the help of stealths. Tony moved to the bridge and saw some minions with swords but also saw rare Balrog with a spear who kicked some booty and added a burden or 3 in the process.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to site 8 as time was running very low, I hurried Tony into making sure I got a final turn against his weakend fellowship, took my wounds, and said done! Your turn! as time was called. Phew! I dropped a massive swarm using They Are Coming to overwhelm Frodo and take the full win. A squeaker if you will.<br>
<br>
Game 2 versus Shawn Tuffy Hobbit/Nazgul<br>
<br>
I will keep this one short. Shawn got all the Hobbits out, Talent for not being seen, used stealths, Nazguls and Black Breaths to slow me down, and I drew garbage most of the game and couldnt pull off a swarm at all. He was at 9 and I was at 6 trying to lose the breaths. This game sucked for me. He played it just right. Full loss. 1 (4)<br>
<br>
Game 3 versus Justin Abdullah Alderman When Hobbits Attack/Moria swarm with Trolls<br>
<br>
This was a huge matchup since I was the highest rated 1-1 and Justin was lowest undefeated. Lucky me I guess. This was also a mirror match pretty much but I had the PATHS in which would turn out to be big. We knew what to do and when to do it. We played identical stuff 1-4 and we used stealths and what not to avoid the Balrog at 5. Heal at 6, stop each other at the Shores. I move to 9 first which is a disadvantage. He has a load stacked on swarms and I am worried. He plays 12 minions! I played it right though. I give the weakest chumps to Frodo, a flanker to Sam and 1 to Boromir, Aragorn had died at 8 so I give the Guard Commander to Merry who was fresh thanks to Farmer Maggot and takes hishimmer from the commander and the commander goes to the swarm, and a flanker to Boromir who had a Saga of Elendil and could take an extra hit. Sweet. He puts 48 power on Frodo! I exert Boromir to pump Merry, exert Merry twice to pump Frodo, use a stealth on frodo, making Frodo a 16, exert Bounder so Justin needs 48 to triple. Well crap he has 48! I use PATHS. He has 5 1 vitality minions, uses his 4 armories, but it kills 1 of them letting me take the win. Phew! Full win 3 (7)<br>
<br>
Game 4 versus Tom LaPorta Sauron/Gandalf/Rare Merry goodness<br>
<br>
I would have to say I got a bit lucky against Tom since he didnt drop a Under the Watching Eye until site 6! His Orcs couldnt do much to my fellowship and my Goblins, and Cave Trolls were eating him alive but he was hanging in there. I moved to site 9 which surprisingly was the Summit and not Tol Brandir since he had about 75 trackers in his deck. He played 6 minions but RareAgorn took on 4 of them to let the others pass safely by. Full win 3 (10)<br>
<br>
Game 5 versus Allen Taylor Twilight Nazgul/Gandlaf/Aragorn<br>
<br>
I wasn&#39;t worried about this matchup. I had seen him play this deck and it didnt look all that great. I knew I could swarm it or blast it with trolls and Twilight doesnt do jack against Merry Superstar and Flaming Brand. Well thats exactly what I did. He moved to bridge already hurting from some cave troll love losing Legolas and Aragorn was exhausted. Out pops the happy Balrog with a spear and makes Aragorn go bye bye and adds a burden. Gandalf cancels the fierceness with his staff but exhausts himself in the process.<br>
<br>
At site 6 I give him some more Goblins to play with and Gandalf cant hack it and dies. His Frodo moves to site 7 exerting himself but takes it on the chin from 2 runners, 2 scavengers, 4 scimitars, and a Cave Troll. I do love Goblin Armory. Full win 3 (13)<br>
<br>
Game 6 versus Mike Belfatto Random large fellowship/Urak/Nazgul Nasties<br>
<br>
Mike is a very good player and I have known him for a long time since he used to play Magic in Tampa but has since moved to Melbourne. I was thinking he was playing a large fellowship runner deck for some reason and thought it was auto lose for me but he wasnt. I dont know where I got that idea. Well, luck had been with me all day so why not now. He had a horrible hand choking Urak draw. Stopped me at 2, he moved to the bridge and I dropped 2 Scouts for free, a runner, a scavenger, and the rare Balrog. He had a total choke all Urak hand and kind of flipped it up in the air to show me he couldnt do anything. Goblin Armory x2 saves my runner and scavenger from Legolas so Frodo gets the runner and Scout and has no sword to protect him. Full Win 3 (16)<br>
<br>
Justin and Chris Coffee were fighting it out and Justin took the win. After about 20 minutes using the Cray Super Computer (MaryGail) we find that I win the tournament by 1 differential!!!! One freaking point! Justin was second.<br>
<br>
I picked the Arwen Foil. Justin took the signed Aragorn and traded it to Allen Taylor for a rare Legolas and a Cave Troll. Nice!<br>
Mike Belfatto was 3rd and took the foil Frodo and ring, and Chris Coffee was 4th taking the Polish Celeborn. Nifty.<br>
<br>
Props and Slops<br>
<br>
Huge incredibly huge mad props to Mary Gail and Chris Coffee. 2 very nice friendly people who ran a very smooth tournament and convention as a whole. Gave out super prizes, including a really nice trophy she had made for the Star Wars open out of her own pocket since Decipher doesnt do anything for it anymore. They were very outgoing with new players, gave out a lot of decks and packs for free, made up cool signs and stuff, and did a super job.<br>
And Chris did the bull dance a few times. Worth the price of admission.<br>
<br>
Props to Chris Revenaugh and Mitch Velasco from Jacksonville. They gave of there time and money to be there and helped out a ton with the open and Mitch played Austin Powers which was a riot.<br>
<br>
Tony Duncan and Howard Busch are also TD&#39;s and they did demos, played in the tournies and were pleasent to be around.<br>
<br>
Extra large props to Justin &quot;Abdullah&quot; Alderman and Marc &quot;Witch King&quot; Thery. The When Hobbits Attack/ Merry Superstar Deck kicks all sorts of booty. Swarm is the toughest thing against it but it is deceptively strong, knocks nazgul in the dirt, and luckily Uraks are not played a whole lot. Go rate this deck 5 stars on their pages. It is really good.<br>
<br>
Props to Chad Bleecker (Eagle1), Mike Belfatto (#3 in Florida), Parth Modi for getting hooked on the game, and the many others who were there.<br>
<br>
David Irvine for winning the open. The Ice Man cameth and kicked booty. Jason Burroughs for being the cool dude he is and playing the exact same decks he has played since Hoth or something. If he shows up, you know what he is playing.<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
<br>
Not a whole lot. Quality Inn for not giving us our requested wake up call.<br>
<br>
Gamers in general. When you go to a CON and stay at a motel, there is this cool invention called a shower. Use it! Bring clean clothes to wear and brush your teeth.<br>
<br>
Slops to all who were not there, you missed a cool CON and great tournaments.<br>
<br>
See you all at the DPC. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3529&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
