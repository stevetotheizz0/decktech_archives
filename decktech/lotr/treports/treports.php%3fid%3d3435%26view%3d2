Pre-Tourney Stuff:<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve been playing a fair number of games recently since I discovered that there were several players who met each Wednesday and alternating Mondays to play LotR and other games. Most of the time, we play multi-player, but it&#39;s still pretty good practice (just have to account for the difference in draws and setting yourself up for the race).<br>
<br>
So, after going a disappointing 2-2 (though I still had fun) in my last tournament when I tried to play it &quot;safe,&quot; using a fairly generic Arwen and Greenleaf start for a target archery deck, I spent the week playing my Strength of Spirit and target archery deck: Pure Versatility, Pure Strength. It&#39;s pretty much the same deck that I posted earlier except that I had two copies, each, of Glamdring and Ranger&#39;s Sword, and only 3 Gandalfs and 1 A Wizard Is Never Late (all I owned). Also, I didn&#39;t own half of the Uruk-hai cards I would have wanted, so my Shadow half was Nazgul. (Note: Decklist posted at the bottom of this report.)<br>
<br>
The deck worked well against the locals in Duluth. I was usually able to gun down everything opposing me on my run to site 9. However, something happened during the week that gave me pause-March 1st. That&#39;s right; the Balrog became legal. And since the only Balrog available skipped the archery phase, I figured that was bad for a target archery deck. So, despite all the fun and success I was having with the deck, I considered scrapping it for a Ranger / Twilight-denial deck. But I just couldn&#39;t make one that I figured would be more consistent. A good ranger deck would skip Gandalf, and I figured Gandalf was essential in the current meta, mainly to kill Goblin Armories with Sleep. Furthermore, at the last tournament I had traded for 2 Friends of the Shire-folk and A Wizard Is Never Late. Eventually, then, I decided to stay with the deck I had and teach myself to play it differently, meaning, essentially, that I would keep Sam alive until the Bridge instead of sacrificing him as soon as Frodo&#39;s burdens were gone. Then Gandalf or Aragorn would have to take the second, fierce skirmish and the two wounds.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I figured I would be in trouble and went to the tournament planning to play the archery deck anyway because it would be fun.<br>
<br>
There were fifteen people. My brother and cousin weren&#39;t in attendance because they were hanging out in Winona. I made the two-hour drive because the tournament was a nice precursor to a visit with my (ex?) girlfriend later in the evening.<br>
<br>
On to the Games:<br>
<br>
Game 1: vs. Paul&#39;s Ranger / Nazgul<br>
<br>
Paul was one of the two players who had beaten me the previous week, then compiling a Fellowship of 8 companions by the third or fourth turn and marching through everything I threw at him. That was one of the games which prompted my switch from a Nazgul / Sauron mix to straight Nazgul; I had just drawn too many cards at the wrong times.<br>
<br>
Anyway, he had gotten second in the last tournament, playing for the championship against Emmanuel and losing at site 5 (though, Paul was the only player that tournament not to be overwhelmed by Emmanuel at site 3!). Emmanuel had played Nazgul, and Paul began our match by telling Emmanuel, &quot;I hope I get to play you. I designed my deck just to beat you.&quot; Great. I was playing Nazgul, and he had designed a deck just to beat Nazgul, starting foil Frodo, OBH; foil rare One Ring; foil Arwen; and foil Legolas, POM. Great.<br>
<br>
He bids zero, I think, and I bid 5. I go first, pull Aragorn with the Pony, look at my hand and curse that there&#39;s no Gandalf, then look again and realize that, hey!, A Wizard Is Never Late is just as good. So I get Gandalf, too. I think I had Glamdring or a Ranger&#39;s Sword. Whatever I had, it was pretty much a perfect opening hand, but I coughed up a ton of Twilight. Two fierce Nazgul came out on the opening turn, along with a Blade Tip, and I had to abandon my Sam strategy. Aragorn took two wounds and the Blade Tip. Gandalf took a wound, and Sam was overwhelmed. I had no choice but to stop.<br>
<br>
Paul pulled Aragon, too, and marched off, past a Nazgul or two, using Ranger&#39;s Versatility at the Ford of Bruinen and came to a halt at the haven.<br>
<br>
I cycled nearly my entire hand and was able to draw a Sleep, Caradhras to save Aragorn. I had my own Versatility for the Nazgul he played at the Ford, and I stopped to heal as well.<br>
<br>
So we danced back and forth. I stopped him at site 4, after he played a ton of stuff-Elrond, and some other junk-allowing me to play 3(!) fierce Nazgul and a sword or two. I moved but also had to stop at site 4, after Gandalf with Glamdring killed Nelya, keeping the shadow low for the Bridge. Paul stealthed both skirmishes with the Balrog but had to stop since there was still a mass of twilight in the pool. I moved to the Bridge, faced the Rog twice, with Gandalf and Aragorn, and stopped. Paul moved to my site 6 and stopped to heal.<br>
<br>
At this point, time was running low for our match, and Paul&#39;s company was large and nearly invulnerable to my Nazgul. Additionally, I had played the best of them already-Witch-king, Toldea, Attea. I didn&#39;t figure I had any hope of stopping him from reaching site 9.<br>
<br>
Thus, I marched from the Bridge, with Gandalf and Aragorn both badly wounded, to site 6, where Strength of Spirit and target archery finished off his Nazgul, whichever it was, exerted Frodo to put out my site 7 with Thror&#39;s Map, and ran forward to the Silverlode Banks, where, A Ranger&#39;s Versatility made short work of his Nazgul.<br>
<br>
So, I took the lead in the race.<br>
<br>
Paul managed to double move to site 8 with 5 minutes left in the round. A nice guy, but a pretty slow player, I decided to help him kill my Nazgul, saying, &quot;Put them here and here, and they both die.&quot; So he did.<br>
<br>
I had two Versatilities in my hand, so I knew I won. I ran to 8, Versatility, two dead Nazgul. Exerted Frodo to put out Tol Brandir, ran on, and won the race after killing two more Nazgul with Versatility.<br>
<br>
Man, you&#39;d think the Versatility thing would get old, but when it&#39;s working for you, it really doesn&#39;t.<br>
<br>
FW 3(3)<br>
<br>
Game 2: vs. James Cameron&#39;s Boromir and Merry start / Moria Orcs<br>
<br>
Well, I was pleased as punch to have won even one game, especially since I managed to get by Paul and his shiny rares. The second game&#39;s pairings were called, and I was destined to play the Terminator, James Cameron.<br>
<br>
Okay, so this James Cameron was a little kid, maybe 14 or so. He&#39;d won his first game, beating some other little kid, but he&#39;d won all the same. And these little kids still had collections something like five times the size of mine, so I wasn&#39;t counting on a win.<br>
<br>
I bid high, again, to go first. Did my thing, pulling Aragorn and had another beautiful draw with Gandalf. I ran to site 3 on my first turn and shot down one or two puny Moria Orcs. Moria Orcs? Sweet! No problem. Well, except I had to be careful at site 4, taking measures to keep Sam alive and prevent wounds on Gandalf and Aragorn in order to get past the Balrog.<br>
<br>
So, that&#39;s what I did. I got through site 4 without a scratch, thanks to Strength of Spirit, and then I stopped. James pressed on, with a wound on Boromir and 4 burdens on Frodo, and… I had Toldea in my hand. In the assignment phase I spotted 4 burdens to assign Toldea to Boromir. Wound. Fierce skirmish, I spotted 4 burdens, again, and killed the Valiant Man of Gondor. Certainly, that had to be a setback for the Terminator&#39;s plans, but, he was, you know… the Terminator, right? Nope. If we had been playing a game in the Marvel or D.C. comics world, this would have been one of those &quot;alternate universe&quot; James Camerons because he was entirely deflated. I actually felt bad for him.<br>
<br>
I took my turn, marching onto the Bridge, prepared to face the Balrog. Instead a small host of orcs marched out, parading the Cave Troll, Scourge of the Black Pit, into view. But, um, I was at the Bridge, half-way across, even, and Legolas and Aragorn had plenty of time to take potshots at the lumbering juggernaut, dropping it in its tracks, arrows piercing its nostrils and eye sockets. The remainder of the orcs fell easily before my swords and fled, so I was able to march onward to site 6 and then stop for a breather.<br>
<br>
Now, James had to move to the Bridge. But I, unlike James, had the Balrog and was prepared to use him. James&#39; Aragorn still hadn&#39;t found his sword, so when the Balrog showed up, James threw his Frodo in front of him and said, &quot;I lose.&quot; What? He still had Aragorn and Sam who could take the hits, and I told him so. With a begrudging shrug, he threw Aragorn and Sam in front of the Balrog and pressed onward with a lone Frodo and 3 Twilight already in the pool. I played a fierce Nazgul, and when James let his Frodo lay down to die (despite the Halfling Stealth I saw in his hand…), I just accepted the anti-climatic victory.<br>
<br>
FW 3(6)<br>
<br>
At the previous tournament, I had reached 2-0 only to fall apart and go 2-2 on the day. So, I expected that with a deck as dependent upon luck as mine (needing the early Gandalf), and my luck as bad as it is, it was time for me to start losing. And, on top of the inevitability of my bad luck, I was paired against Mitch, who I&#39;d heard was one of the top players in the area.<br>
<br>
Game 3: vs. Mitch&#39;s Gandalf and Elves / Nazgul<br>
<br>
I won the bid yet again, with my 5 burdens to Mitch&#39;s 2, and went first. Mitch started Gandalf, Friend of the Shirefolk, and after I played Gandalf from my hand and Aragorn with the Pony, Mitch set the Weatherhills ahead of my company. Hmm… Okay, so I&#39;d given him a bunch of Twilight to work with. I just hoped he didn&#39;t have anything nasty.<br>
<br>
Like an Attea and Witch-king. Yuck. I was brutalized, but I survived with two wounds on both Gandalf and Aragorn (since I wanted to keep Sam alive until the Bridge). I had a Versatility in my hand, too, and expected that he&#39;d play the Ford, but I just couldn&#39;t risk the movement in case he had more Nazgul to hammer me. I stopped.<br>
<br>
I reconciled my hand, dropping to draw the extra card (always do that), and then it was Mitch&#39;s turn. He added a burden to play Aragorn (three burdens), then wondered something aloud, only to play Galadriel and exert her for two more Elf allies. He got out Gandalf&#39;s cart, too, and dropped a bow into it. Unfortunately for Mitch, the 3 Twilight for Galadriel was just enough to get out my second fierce Nazgul and a Nazgul sword. Gandalf took two wounds and a Black Breath, and Aragorn died. Obviously, he stopped.<br>
<br>
I moved to the Ford of Bruinen where Versatility did its thing, and I stopped to heal.<br>
<br>
Mitch played some more allies and moved to the Ford where another fierce Nazgul attacked, and Gandalf died.<br>
<br>
I arrived safely at site 4 and stopped, letting Mitch walk into site 4 with a lonely Frodo, and Frodo was caught and slaughtered by Ulaire Somebody.<br>
<br>
FW 3(9)<br>
<br>
I was pleased and amazed, and Mitch explained that he was trying out a Mines of Moria strategy before the set had been released. He sorted out his deck to show me all the Elves he had in it, along with Mirror of Galadriel and 4 copies of the card that discards one from my hand each time he plays an Elf. I was glad he hadn&#39;t had time to set up that whole combination.<br>
<br>
As it was, I was paired to play against he only other undefeated player, Emmanuel, for the championship match. I&#39;d heard that he was cycling his deck like crazy; someone had remarked that he&#39;d cycled by site 4 in one of his earlier games. People were trying to say more, but I asked them not to. I wasn&#39;t going to pretend I hadn&#39;t heard what had already been said, but I didn&#39;t want to know everything about his deck before we even started. Either then or earlier, Paul had been about to tell Emmanuel how he was going to beat him using the combination I&#39;d shown him, but I shushed Paul before he said what it was (Target Archery / Strength of Spirit / Barliman-and, yes, I told Paul that I hadn&#39;t invented the combination… Relax all of you who were about to slam me for taking credit for it; I didn&#39;t).<br>
<br>
Game 4: vs. Emmanuel&#39;s Pipeweed / Moria Swarm<br>
<br>
I won the bid to complete my bidding sweep! I pulled Aragorn with the Prancing Pony, but I didn&#39;t have any way to get Gandalf. Bummer. It was typical, though, for my draws to fail me in the last game against a guy who&#39;d only lost one tournament game since the New Year, despite playing in a tournament every week.<br>
<br>
But I was fortunate that Emmanuel had a fairly bad hand, too; his was almost all Fellowship cards. He tossed out a Goblin Armory and They Are Coming and one or two tiny orcs, but I crushed them mercilessly and was able--thanks to his Bree Gate and Rivendell Waterfall-to cruise on to site 4. After catching him minion-less at site 4, I considered running to 5. He was probably upset with how long I took to make my decision. Yet, there were nearly 20 Twilight tokens in the pool, and he could have been bluffing. Finally, after careful consideration, I stopped.<br>
<br>
Emmanuel dropped Gandalf&#39;s Cart from his hand and started playing Old Toby, drawing a bunch of cards, and backed up Gandalf with Aragorn via the Pony and Gimli from his hand. But when he moved, he washimmer Ulaire Nelya who converted his Waterfall to my Ford of Bruinen, and he was forced to stop after taking one wound each on Gandalf and Aragorn.<br>
<br>
On my next turn, I played Thror&#39;s Map, holding a versatility, was able to march through the Bridge with little difficulty, taking a couple of not-unforeseen wounds, and then to my Lothlorien Woods to stop and rest. I drew back to hand size, but unfortunately, the only Shadow card I found was an All Blades Perish.<br>
<br>
So, Emmanuel was able to go about two-thirds of the way through his deck, manipulating everything with Pipes, Pipeweeds, Elrond and Bilbo, removing burdens and wounds and twilight. He put out Thror&#39;s Map and used it to replace the Ford, then looked at my hand with Sting and knew he had clear sailing to the Bridge. The Balrog came out, though, and Emmanuel&#39;s Gandalf and Aragorn each took a couple of wounds.<br>
<br>
 During my Fellowship phase I played Sleep, Caradhras to wipe out his Armories, Swarms and They Are Coming and then exerted Frodo to play the Silverlode. Emmanuel finally played his first real swarm, and even though, I had A Ranger&#39;s Versatility, I needed to use all my Strengths of Spirit and exert once or twice to knock out the Cave Troll and a bunch of other baddies. With my hand depleted of Fellowship cards, and the end in sight, I decided to stop.<br>
<br>
Emmanuel played more Pipeweed stuff and then moved, his deck nearly exhausted. I dropped Attea, I think, and he was forced to stop at Lorien to heal. When he reconciled his hand, he exhausted his deck.<br>
<br>
I exerted Frodo to put out my site 8 so that he wouldn&#39;t be able to spot 5 orcs to stop my movement, and I won. Emmanuel didn&#39;t bother playing anything if he had it, knowing my archery and Gandalf would just decimate it. I had another Versatility or two in my hand for the Troll, anyway.<br>
<br>
That was my first tournament win, then, and I got several packs from the TD and pulled a rare One Ring among them. I also got a Blade of Gondor for which Big Red (see my previous reports) traded me a Cave Troll, and I also traded him a Goblin Armory that I pulled for a Last Alliance (I only had the one Armory-not yet enough to consider building a deck around).<br>
<br>
Mike Raveling, who was sticking around to play a basketball ccg, asked me what I&#39;d won. I showed him a certificate I&#39;d been given and said I was going to replace it with my college diploma. I reconsidered and said that I&#39;d won the &quot;respect and admiration of my peers.&quot; Ha!<br>
<br>
Anyway, I started a fun game with Graham Neal after the tournament since he was so pleased with his deck. He&#39;d only lost once-to Emmanuel, so it was quite likely a good deck.<br>
<br>
We started, and he began with the rare Aragorn and Frodo (even though I&#39;d started the Pony again!). So I knew he was playing Tennet&#39;s Don&#39;t Pee in the Twilight Pool since he was borrowing a deck idea Jim Li had given him, and Jim Li had earlier borrowed Tennet&#39;s deck.<br>
<br>
Well, I rushed on fearlessly, anyhow, getting to site 3 without incident against orcs with roaming penalties. Graham made a fatal mistake, adding 3 Twilight for Athelas, Sting and something else. Thus I was able to get out Nelya and convert Graham&#39;s site 3 to the Ford. Aragorn faced Nelya, defeating one attack, but suffered a wound and Black Breath in the second attack.<br>
<br>
Since Tennet&#39;s deck revolved around Aragorn, Graham was basically screwed. Meanwhile, I played Albert Dreary and ran forward. At the Bridge, Graham played the Cave Troll and some other masses of Orcs, but Dreary got rid of two armories. So, even though Graham discarded his other two Armories to prevent wounds, Legolas and Aragorn had enough Strength of Spirit to shoot down the Troll and all the other menacing Orcs.<br>
<br>
I stopped.<br>
<br>
Graham lost both Pippin and Thrarin by site 4 with the Bridge coming up on his next turn.<br>
<br>
I ran to my site 6 (Thror&#39;s Map, again) without incident and stopped.<br>
<br>
But I didn&#39;t have time to play the Balrog against Graham since I looked at the clock and realized I needed to drive to downtown Minneapolis to see my girl. So I did.<br>
<br>

<br>
Until next time,<br>
<br>
Walk with Eru,<br>
