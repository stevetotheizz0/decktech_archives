My first LOTR constructed tournament, a day to be remembered. A day in which the alliance of Men and vicious Hobbits proved to be succesful, claiming 3 wins and 1 (close) loss. Overall, it was a great tournament, with about 14 local players, some new and some familiar. Among those attending were Mike The Judge Blumberg, the Derfman, and the infamous Neal Dredlox Razi.<br>
 Seeing as how this was my first tournament I didn&#39;t quite know what to expect. Would archery reign supreme? What about big Nazgul decks? And how many Cave Trolls would I encounter? To these questions I knew no answers, but I did know one thing: whatever happens, just be sure to have fun! So with that in mind, I grabbed my When Hobbits Attack! deck, made some modifications to it, and bravely jumped into the orgy of Orcs, Nazgul and archery fire. I only made sure that I had my good luck charm - my R2-D2 figurine - with me at all times.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
My first opponent went by the name of Zach Griswold. I didn&#39;t know this guy so I assumed he was new to the game. He bid 3 as did I so we flipped for it and it came up in my favor. I told him to go first. He started Gimli (u) and Samwise. Hmm.. I thought. He whipped out the Prancing Pony and yanked Aragorn the King out. Oh goody. He gave Gimli an axe and prepared to set out to do some brave fighting. He encountered a Goblin Patrol Troop and he stayed at site 2. on my go I threw down Aragorn, put down some swords, and set out. I encountered some Uruks, but Boromir with his blade made short work of them. I ended up moving to 3, where I stayed. On his turn he puts down Boromir (u) and heads to 3 and stayed put. My turn, I pee in the pool by putting down Aragorn and some possesions so he drops some feirce Uruks (Hunt them Down). No problem. I play a Valient Man and all is well. His next turn he drops Gandalf the Grey. WHAT!? By now he had 6 companions. I lokked at my hand: Ulaire Enquea. I almost laughed out loud. Someone was going to die! He moves and I slam down Enquea. I shout out in my best female-ghetto voice UH-UH! Who Dat B*TCH!? Several people looked at me but I just pointed at Boromir. Zach looked dumbfounded. I played a few more guys and in the maneuver I exerted Enquea to send the Working Man Boromir to early retirement. After that the game was now just move and catch-up. He flung some Orcs of the Eye at me teamed with some Uruks but he never really played anything to worry me. He did put a You Bring Great Evil on my healthy Boromir at site 5 but Boromir never took a wound or exerted for the rest of the game! Anyway I claimed victory when I walked into site 9 and held tough. It was a good game and Zach, you&#39;re pretty cool and I hope to see you at later tournaments.<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
Hmm..first game was big Fellowship and Uruk/Eye teamup. I wonder whats next?I got the answer soon enough. My next opponent was Torey Martinez. I play Torey every week so I kinda had a clue as to what he might be playing. Its usually Hobbits and Nazgul so I assumed that would be it. He bid 3 but I bid 4. I told him to go first, hoping I wouldn&#39;t ever have to walk into the Weatherhills. He started Merry (u) and Boromir (u), played the Pony and yanked the sweaty Ranger of the North. Then came the Thror&#39;s Map. gosh darnit! He laughs, I cringe and he plays the Weatherhills. Crap! I drop Enquea, he fights him off, and stays put. I drop nothing, hoping I would force a Nazgul choke and not fight one, but he drops Cantea. I Stealth and exert Boromir to keep Merry alive. There&#39;s no way in hell I&#39;m moving against one Nazgul into another sight - it would be suicide. I stay, which allows him to play the Ford. He walks safely to site 3 and stays put. gosh darnit. My turn, I have to walk into that deathtrap and I am not thrilled. He drops a Nazgul- Ostea. Thanks to a Stealth and a Bounder/Boromir exert I survive. On his turn I play a Goblin Swarms and manage to get a few Orcs stacked by fighting Aragorn and Boromir (he had NO pump cards) but he Stealthed like crazy with the Hobbits. On my turn however, I receive a Morgul Gated Witchking with a Pale Blade. I crap my pants (metaphorically speaking). Thanxs to Aragorn, his sword and Merry,superstar I live but Merry gets a Blade Tip.Oh well, Aragorn heals him. He moves to 5 and I continue to stack the Orcs that face the Men and I forsee that the swarm will occur within the next few turns. His Hobbits still stealth like crazy. I move to 5 and survive more Nazgul beatdown but its okay- nobody&#39;s dead.I stay. He moves on his turn. I play my Dale (phew) and commence the beatdown. There&#39;s 3 extra Orcs so they pile on Boromir, thus killing him. His Fellowship crippled, Torey stays. I move to 6 and Aragorn with a Daggerstrike takes out Ostea. I stay. Torey moves to 7 and I let loose another swarm , this time killing Aragorn with a Goblin-Gang-Bang. He stays. On my turn I encounter a couple of big beef Nazgul so I take mucho wounds. I stay. Torey moves to 8 and Frodo takes 5 Orcs up the butt, winning me the game. We shook hand and laughed - it was a good game.<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
2 games won, 2 more to go. So far its been great. I pet my R2 figure, hoping his magic still works. Suddenly I hear Abdullah vs. Mike. Hmmm...The Judge. A worthy opponent. Mike and I are both decent card players so I was certain this game would be a nail-biter. However, Mike plays a new deck every week so its impossible to even guess what he might be playing. But hey, its a tournament and mystery is always a part of that- its what makes it fun! Anyway, I was glad I had already smoked a cigarette. <br>
We sit down and say a few Mo Fugga lines. Mike bids 2 and I bid 3 - I tell him to go first. He reveals Arwen and Legolas. Hmmm...archery, anyone? He plays the Pony, yanks the King in Exile, and plays Galadriel. He walks to the Trollshaw, where he encounters a Patrol Troop. Mike plays A Ranger&#39;s  Versatility and the Troop expires to NORMAL archery! Crap! However, he stays.<br>
I go and play Aragorn, his bow and some other weapons. I walk and encounter little resistance- an Inquisitor. Aragorn riddles him with arrows and I walk on. Uh-oh. The Ford is in my way. I get a Nazgul and a Tower Lietenant. I take some hits but I survive.<br>
His go, he moves to 3 and I drop Enquea. WHO DAT B*TCH!? Doesn&#39;t matter, he gets Versatilitied and killed. However, Mike stays.<br>
I go and on this turn I&#39;m fortunate: I double move to 5. Fortunate? Well, let me restate that. I was a survivor. Sure I walked but I took quite a few hits from the Nazgul and Sauron Orcs. Now I got a few nasty conditions on me too: Desparate Defense of the Ring and Thin and Stretched are on my key guys. Uh, Athelas anyone?<br>
On his turn he gets the Mirror, Mirror deck going. He drops the Mirror and plays Celeborn. He walks after dropping a bow on Aragorn. He walks to 4, encounters some Orcs and slays them. He stays, surprisingly.<br>
I go and walk to 6, taking some hits from a Band of the Eye (duh-duh-duh-duh-duh!)and stay. I&#39;ve really got to heal or otherwise I&#39;d like to broaden the gap between the competing Fellowships.<br>
His turn, he Mirrors twice and moves on. The blasted mirror screws me up, forcing me to discard key minions, and thus foils the swarm. He walks to 6, where Celeborn b*tch-slaps a Moria Scout. Ouch!<br>
I walk to 7, and encounter a few Nazgul-Toldea and Cantea- plus a couple of Orcs. This time Merry gets killed by an Orcish assualt and the Fellowship suffers. Dammit.<br>
Mike walks to 7 and drops Rumil. Crizzap. He stays after killing a bunch of orcs.<br>
I walk to 8 and face a huge onslaught of baddies. Boromir dies and I stay. I would have loved to double move but my Fellwoship was too crippled. Also the Orc conditions were taking their toll. Alas! Where were those blasted Atheli and Master Samwise? Screw them. Those rat-b*stards abandoned me!<br>
Mike goes and walks to 8 and kills like 5 or 6 Orcs. He walks to 9 and then I finally run out of cards. Uh-oh. I offer no worthy resistance and Mike claims victory. To the victor go the spoils and the loser may weep like a school girl. <br>
Anyway , Mikes a good player and I know I&#39;ll get him in the rematch, heheh. Thanx Mike for that intense,close game and don&#39;t ever underestimate an angry hobbit! They&#39;ll get you when you least expect it! :D<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
Okay, 2 wins and a lost. Not bad, but there&#39;s still one more game. I suck down 2 cigarettes and prepare to play by checking out the fine poontang walking around the store. I had my eyes set on this 16 year-old redhead in a tight red shirt. Ah.... Okay I&#39;m ready!<br>
I&#39;m going against Adam Martinez. It&#39;s Toreys brother. Cool. Adam is cool as hell - he&#39;s real small but he can make some huge disses on people. He always surprises me. He bids 0 and I bid 2. I tell him to go first and he reveals Gimli (r) and Farin. DWARVES! Kewl.<br>
He drops Gimli&#39;s Axe and Helm first turn and walks. He hacks a few orcs and stays.<br>
I go and drop some weapons. I walk and face a few Moria Orcs. I kill them and walk on, and face a few more Orcs. Big deal, I kill them and stay.<br>
He goes and walks to 3, where he stays. <br>
I go, drop Aragorn , and walk to 4. He drops 5 Orcs. Uh-oh. Due to an error in judgement, I assign Boromir to a tough guy and Boromir gets killed off. I was like, uh.... that wasn&#39;t supposed to happen , but whatever.I wasn&#39;t goping to take anything back. Needless to say, I stayed.<br>
On his turn he spits out like 4 Dwarf Guards. JEEZ! He walks and I crap out a huge swarm. He takes it and loses about half his crew and stays.<br>
I go and and walk to 5. Thanx to a Goblin Swarms, he lays down a huge working crew of Orcs. He killed Merry and I fell like crying. Not literally, but man, it sucked! It was now just Aragorn! Its all a matter of luck and survival now I told myself. Maybe I could overwhelm him soon, I figured.<br>
He walks to 5 and I lay more guys out and I end up killing the rest of the guards. Its now back to Farin and Gimli. He stays.<br>
I go and walk into the Dale and face yet another swarm. Frodo and Aragorn live barely, thanx to daggerstrikes and Stealths. I stay to heal.<br>
He goes and lay just enough guys to keep him from moving again. Its getting pretty close by now.<br>
I heal and move to 7. Now I&#39;m starting to get screwed- I have no Bounder and I don&#39;t think I can survive. He lays down the Orcs and I live by Saccing my Saga and playing about a million pump cards on both guys. I stay.<br>
He goes and moves to 7. I throw down a decent swarm and kill Farin. Yes, now its only a matter of time as long as I don&#39;t get overwhelmed first! He stays.<br>
I move to 8 and Aragorn gets swarmed to death. Its now only Frodo. Its doubtful I could survive another move so reluctantly I stay. <br>
He goes and I drop only 3 guys. 2 Scavenger/Scimitar and a Guard Commander. He gives Frodo the Commander and Gimli takes a Scavenger. I pile the other guy on Frodo because I see Frodo is totally helpless (no cards on him) and by now I think I would have too. I leave 2 in the Twilight pool.<br>
Gimli plays a pump card and adds 1 to the twilight. He wins the skirmish and deals 1 dameage to another Orc- the Scavenger on Frodo. CRAP! But wait! I use 3 twilight and pump the Commander up to 9! Adam shakes his head and shakes my hand. I get the game. YEAH! That was a close Mo Fuggin game! And all thanx to the Commander (props to Neal Razi for convincing me to play him in my deck)!<br>

Results<br>
Okay the record for me is 3-1, and I have 10 points. Unfortunatley for me , so does Moose and The Judge. A Tie Breaker is done and I end up with 4th, Moose 3rd and Mike 2nd. (Screw you Decipher for your crappy system!)Neal Razi brought home the title of winner by having 11 points; congrats Neal.<br>
