It's none other than Mark Balderston's <b>Archery for Dummies</b>.<br />
<br />
The judging was so tight between our fantastic and hard working judges <b>Marc Therry</b>, <b>John Arendt</b>, and <b>Michael Dalton</b>, that it was felt a run off was needed between Archery for Dummies and perennial DeckTech favorite Alex Tennet's <b>Don't Pee in the Twilight Pool</b>.  After a week of playtesting and mastering, David Akers and Neal Razi went to a 9 game final duel.  The slimmest of margins decided the duel, Mark edging out Alex 5-4.<br />
<br />
The games were epic at they were almost polar opposites.  Mark's fellowship with huge aimed archery damage continually had to defend itself from swarms of Goblins and Trolls.  Many fair fellowship companions were lost along the way, never to wander under the stars in Middle Earth again, but in the end, they were undone by the Ring Bearer.<br />
