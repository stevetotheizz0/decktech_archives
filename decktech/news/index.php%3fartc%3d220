<br />
THE PRECEDING ERRATA ARE ANNOUNCED 7/16/2<br />
THESE ERRATA ARE EFFECTIVE FOR SANCTIONED TOURNAMENT PLAY AS OF 8/1/2<br />
<br />
Here's some info on the needs for these changes.<br />
<br />
Ring of Secrets, Rayje's Construct, Shadow Vinoc, Inhibitor Band:<br />
These cards are often used to exploit the many zero-cost Relics in the game.<br />
Decks that favor Relics over other card types are great, but these cards<br />
allow those decks to follow non-interactive playstyles, which are not in the<br />
sprit of Magi-Nation.<br />
<br />
Undream Abilities:<br />
We all love free energy, but being able to turn that energy from a<br />
containable problem (like a single, huge creature) to an open-ended<br />
nightmare (a Magi with nearly limitless energy) is too powerful. Many decks<br />
use that limitless energy to enact locks and other non-interactive combos.<br />
<br />
Rayje:<br />
Wily allowed Rayje to select the most debilitating and restrictive Spells to<br />
use against his opponent every turn. Limiting his selection a bit contains<br />
this problem, while still allowing him several useful cards to choose from.<br />
<br />
Mydra Swarm:<br />
The dreaded 'Mydra Swarm Lock' deck has been discussed for a while now, and<br />
we're taking this opportunity to remove the deck from the tournament<br />
environment along with the other non-interactive deck archetypes. Mydra<br />
Swarm is now an effective tool to use against players who use card-drawing<br />
engines each turn.<br />
<br />
Furlosk:<br />
When you find a deadline only hours away and need to create a card for the<br />
print sheets, it's easy to make something that is absolutely not broken.<br />
It's also easy to go too far. This change makes Furlosk a bit more playable.<br />
<br />
Other Bograth Cards:<br />
Bograth's mighty card-drawing, energy-gaining engine worked far better then<br />
our designers and playtesters imagined, allowing players to draw into their<br />
entire deck and fund all of those cards relatively easily, and without a<br />
chance for the opponent to respond. These changes were made to bring Bograth<br />
down to an acceptable speed.<br />
<br />
Liriel's Cape:<br />
This wording matches the designer's intent of the card. A new proxy card<br />
image will be available at the Magi-Nation website shortly.<br />
<br />
Shell:<br />
What was intended to be used as a 'protect my stuff so I can make a<br />
comeback' card is being used as a 'protect my stuff to extend my advantage'<br />
card. This version prevents a player from dominating by protecting his cards<br />
every turn.</font></td></tr></table><a href=edit.php?220>edit</a> | <a href=send.php?di=/news/index.php&id=220>send to friend</a> | <a href=print.php?220>printer friendly</a></font></td></tr>
