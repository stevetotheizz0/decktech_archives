<br>
1. Introduction <br>
<br>
While the Jedi seem to control the galaxy, there lies a phantom menace in the shadows. After a millennia, the Sith are back. It would be an overstatement to say that they&#8217;re &#8220;back in numbers&#8221;, but what they lack in numbers they compensate in badassness. The Sith are ready to take back what&#8217;s theirs, and they won&#8217;t be stopped by some pesky flashlight-weilding Jedi.<br>
<br>
This is my first Dark Side deck to include the almighty Darth Tyranus, and his trustworthy companion Jango Fett. Together with Zam Wesell, they journey the galaxy where no Lucas has gone before. Their enemies, the evil and bloodthirsty Jedi, will stop at nothing to make sure our heroes don&#8217;t survive another day. Still, the end of the day will see the victory of the Sith and the beginning of a new reign &#8230;<br>
<br>
While this deck may resemble some other DS decks, please keep in mind that the number of cards is low and the number of good DS cards is even lower. I&#8217;ve tried to make a deck that&#8217;s not like the other decks, but there are of course some likenesses. When I started creating this deck, I wanted a deck that could stand up to those LS speed decks that we see all the time. It&#8217;s time for the Jedi to feel a sense of strangulation. It&#8217;s time for The Choke Hold ;)<br>
<br>
I hope you take the time reading through the entire strategy section. In addition to including the important combos and general strategy, I have also included my reasoning why the different cards are included. By reading this, you will hopefully realize how this deck works and how it&#8217;s played. If you&#8217;re one of those who immediately understand everything about a deck, read no further. If you&#8217;re curious and want to know more about this deck, read on and discover the true power of the Dark Side &#8230;<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Overview<br>
<br>
When a war rages, the true heroes rise from combat. Even though they&#8217;re heavily outnumbered, the valiant Sith will defeat the evil Jedi and once again restore peace and order to the galaxy. Can you feel The Choke Hold of the Dark Side?<br>
<br>
This deck is about power, and about countering swarms. By using a mixture of light, medium and heavy units in the arenas, this deck will beat down your opponent&#8217;s deck and make sure that it stays down.<br>
<br>
Since the best DS battle cards (Dark Speed, Strength of Hate) work on one unit only, this deck utilizes somewhat heavy units that are able to deal with swarms by taking damage and still wearing the swarms down.<br>
<br>
We all know that the first round of combat is very important. This deck uses the excellent Capture Obi-Wan along with Nexu&#8217;s to choke your opponent&#8217;s force flow. If you get out one Capture Obi-Wan and have a Nexu in the character arena, the only evading your opponent can afford is Shaak Ti&#8217;s, Anakin&#8217;s (B) or a Hero&#8217;s Dodge. This will allow Jango, Tyranus or Zam to kill off Jedi in an amazing speed.<br>
<br>
The LS Jedi Speed deck is the most popular deck archetype right now. The speed decks attacks first and often in numbers, leaving the opponent with nothing to attack with. Some have claimed that these decks are the best ones, and that no DS deck could beat them. This deck tries to prove that it&#8217;s indeed possible to win against LS. The powerful units will, combined with the right power-ups and prevention cards, stand up to any type of LS deck.<br>
<br>
Character:<br>
<br>
Darth Tyranus and Jango Fett are, without doubt, the two best DS characters. Combining speed and power, the two brothers-in-arms are able to wipe out most Jedi resistance. They receive help from Zam Wesell, another good DS unit, which is able to both heal and attack hard. As a supplement to the badfreedom fighters, the Nexu will often prevent your opponent&#8217;s Jedi from evading. With 4x Tyranus&#8217;s Gift, Jango Fett will live to see another round of combat.<br>
<br>
Ground:<br>
<br>
Even though Light Side has the best ground units (in my opinion), these ground units are able to put up quite a fight. Even though the DS units has lower base speed than the LS units, 3x Luxury Airspeeders and 4x Dark Speed should be able to fix the problem. The units has both good power and health (excluding Walking Droid Fighter). They are able to take some damage and still be alive to deliver the game-winning attack.<br>
<br>
Space:<br>
<br>
Most LS decks use cheap, fast starfighters to overwhelm and destroy the opponent&#8217;s units. There is a solution to this: Shields. Both the Commerce Guild Starship and the Intergalactic Banking Clan has Shields 1, and they&#8217;re able to prevent the LS starfighters from attacking as hard as they usually do. Another way to prevent space swarms from being effective is using Tyranus&#8217;s Solar Sailer. Every player who&#8217;s ever played with the Sailer knows that it&#8217;s one of the best DS space units. It attacks before every LS unit, and it&#8217;s easily capable of destroying one starfighter per round.<br>
<br>
Battle:<br>
<br>
When looking at the units, I saw that this deck needed speed, damage prevention and power bonuses. The choice was easy: Dark Speed, Tyranus&#8217;s Gift and Strength of Hate. Each of these cards are capable of winning you a game, providing it&#8217;s played at the right time. There are some things these cards share in common: They work in every arena and they can be played every round. With cards like High-Force Dodge, you have to wait one round before being able to play it. The battle cards in this deck are cheap. They have versatility. They&#8217;re good. What more could you desire? ;)<br>
<br>
Mission:<br>
<br>
As mentioned in Overview, Capture Obi-Wan is one of the key cards in this deck. Even though you have 2 copies, you will usually be able to get one in hand after setup. Denying your opponent of force and supplying you, Capture Obi-Wan is a great asset in your struggle against the Light Side. Also included is a Splinter the Republic and a Return to Spaceport, two great cards that will help you get more power and heal your ground units. <br>
<br>
<br>
3. Card choices <br>
<br>
Character (15 cards):<br>
<br>
Darth Tyranus (A) x 2<br>
Tyranus A is the monster of the character arena, costing 9 build points for 50/7/5. By using only 1 force, he is able to attack with 9 power (This is before you get him stacked). He can also evade 3 damage for 3 force and deflect 1 damage for 2 force. No matter how much force you have, Tyranus will be able to use that force to your advantage. Forget Obi-Wan, forget Anakin &#8230; It&#8217;s Tyrannosaurus Tyranus that is the King of the character arena.<br>
<br>
Darth Tyranus (B) x 2<br>
Tyranus B is a very good unit for the seven build points he costs. He&#8217;s a 50/6/4, with an excellent critical hit 2 for 2 force ability. While this Tyranus isn&#8217;t able to deflect, he&#8217;s still able to evade 3 damage for 3 force. Tyranus B is able to hold of attackers until you can stack the A version on top, or you can get out Jango.<br>
<br>
Darth Tyranus (C) x 1<br>
Say hello to Mr. Stack. This version of our heroic hero Tyranus is almost the same as Anakin C, except that Anakin has +10 speed and a master and a girlfriend to help him out. Needless to say, this Tyranus is best face down at the bottom of a stack. Still, he can be used as bait in setup to see if your opponent has any characters in hand. If he does drop Obi-Wan B, smile as you stack Tyranus A or B on top of this guy.<br>
<br>
Jango Fett (A) x 1<br>
Another extremely powerful character, Jango Fett A is a real beast against Jedi. While costing as much as eight build points, Jango is 60/7/6 and critical hit 2 against Jedi. If you can afford a stacked Jango A, there is not much that can stop Jango from shooting down Jedi (and other characters) like there was no tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Jango Fett (B) x 2<br>
This Jango is my favourite, and this is why I&#8217;ve included two copies. The reason is the low build cost of only six, and the power you get. Jango B is 60/6/4, getting +1 power and critical hit 1 against Jedi. As you can see, the only difference in Jango A and Jango B against Jedi is critical hit 1. The other difference between the two versions is two points of health. Still, with the health bonus fro stacks and Tyranus&#8217;s Gift, Jango lives to see another day.<br>
<br>
Jango Fett (C) x 1<br>
This version of Jango costs five build points, one less than the B version. Jango C is a 60/4/4 units who&#8217;s power +2 against Jedi. An attack of 6 dice will statistically give 3 hits, and this is simply not enough against evading Jedi. Therefore, this Jango is best in a stack, or combined with a Strength of Hate.<br>
<br>
Jango Fett (D) x 1<br>
Don&#8217;t expect Jango D to survive very long alone in the character arena. Jango D is a 50/4/3 unit with critical hit 1 that costs four build points. Both Anakin (A,B,C) and Padmé (A) attacks before this Jango. He&#8217;s another unit in the stack, and that&#8217;s about it.<br>
<br>
Zam Wesell x 2<br>
Instead of including even more copies of Jango, I&#8217;ve chosen to add two Zam Wesell&#8217;s. Zam shares Jango Fett (B)&#8217;s basic stats, but it&#8217;s her gametext that makes her a good addition to this deck. When the battle in the character arena starts, you can choose to either give her critical hit 2 or remove 1 damage counter from her. In other words, she can work both offensive and defensive. Still, most of the time you&#8217;ll be using the critical hit 2.<br>
<br>
Nexu x 3<br>
I can&#8217;t begin to tell you how much I like these units. Oh, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing right now ;) They cost 5, 50/4/3. Not much, but it&#8217;s their gametext that makes them great. &#8220;As long as Nexu is in the Character arena, each activated ability of your opponent&#8217;s units costs 1 more force to play.&#8221; This means that all the previously free abilities (like tapping Bail Organa, tapping Jedi Patrol) cost 1 force, and that all the Jedi evade abilities also cost +1 force. Combined with a Capture Obi-Wan, the Nexu can and will choke your opponent for force.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ground (16 cards): <br>
<br>
Destroyer Droid Squad x 4<br>
In my opinion, one of the best DS ground units. The DD Squad costs 5 build points, and for that you get a 40/5/5 unit. The thing that&#8217;s so good about the Squad is that it attacks before any Clone Platoon or Elite Jedi Squad, possibly destroying them before they can do anything. <br>
<br>
Luxury Airspeeder x 3<br>
It&#8217;s not a deck unless it has some Luxury Airspeeder&#8217;s ;). This unit is a good unit, increasing the speed of every other ground unit by 10. It costs 3, and what you get is 60/2/2. These little buggers will often be targeted first in ground combats, so save some Tyranus&#8217;s Gift around to save them.<br>
<br>
Geonosian Defense Platform x 3<br>
Costing seven build points for a 20/7/7 unit, some might find the Platform a bit expensive. To counter those AT-TE walkers you need something that doesn&#8217;t die from the primary attack. The Defense Platform both takes and gives a lot of damage. Combine this unit with a Strength of Hate, and you&#8217;ll be able to take out one of those Walkers in one attack.<br>
<br>
Walking Droid Fighter x 3<br>
If there ever was a unit that had &#8220;Play Dark Speed Here&#8221; written on it, it&#8217;s this impressive soon-to-be fighter. Many people might wonder why I&#8217;ve included this unit. Their thought might be: &#8220;Why include the fighter when it dies so quickly?&#8221; The reason is it&#8217;s high power, and the fact that it will attack first with the right combo (Dark Speed and Luxury Airspeeder&#8217;s).<br>
<br>
Trade Federation Battleship Core x 3<br>
Oh my, these Space Balls are powerful. They cost a lot, too. For the low, low cost of nine build points, you get a 10/10/12 unit. Yes, a 10/10/12 unit. When it attacks, you roll 10 dice. It needs 12 damage counters to be destroyed. This is the Bowling Ball From Hell: Big, bad and bloody powerful. With one of these out, you will be destroying AT-TE walkers by simply rolling over them (ok, maybe shooting at them. Rolling is cooler).<br>
<br>
<br>
Space (15 cards): <br>
<br>
Intergalactic Banking Clan Starship x 3<br>
If you&#8217;ve looked for a solution to the problem of LS speed swarm starfighter mofos, this is it. The IGBC Starship costs five build points, a real bargain for the 20/4/5 unit that it is. The reason it&#8217;s so good against starfighters is the Shields 1, lowering every attacking unit&#8217;s power by 1. The N-1 Starfighter doesn&#8217;t look that dangerous when attacking with 1 power :).<br>
<br>
Droid Starfighter Wing x 3<br>
Four build points: 40/4/4. Fast enough to attack first with a Dark Speed, and enough power to destroy a Bravo N-1 Starfighter or an N-1 Starfighter in one attack (or even a Jedi Starfighter, Obi-Wan&#8217;s Starfighter or Naboo Starfighter Squadron if you&#8217;re lucky). Good.<br>
<br>
Droid Starfighter Squadron x 3<br>
The little brother of the Wing, this unit costs 1 less BP, and has one less power and health. It can take some damage, and is also able to attack well.<br>
<br>
Commerce Guild Starship x 2<br>
Another good unit with Shields. As someone once said, &#8220;Shields 1 is good&#8221;. I have to say I agree. 30/3/4 for four build points. And Shields, which is good.<br>
<br>
Tyranus&#8217;s Solar Sailer x 2<br>
In about ten years, when talking about hit-and-run attacks, people will not use the expression &#8220;hit-and-run&#8221;. They will say &#8220;Our forces made a Solar Sailer attack&#8221;. That they will say, and people will nod and understand. Why is this? Tyranus&#8217;s Solar Sailer _i-and-run. It costs four build points, 60/2/2 and has critical hit 2 (good). It can retreat after it has attacked. This is incredibly good. Hit. And run.<br>
<br>
Trade Federation Battleship x 2<br>
The One Battleship to finish them all. Costing 6 build points for 10/4/6 and bombard 4, this starship has two reasons for being in the deck: 1) It finishes off units that are already damaged and 2) It bombards. Those 4 dice of bombardment can kill off an Elite Jedi Squad before it gets a chance to attack your ground units. It&#8217;s not easy to deflect Great Balls of Destruction when they rain down from the sky.<br>
<br>
Battle (10 cards):<br>
<br>
Tyranus&#8217;s Gift x 4<br>
Real Sith don&#8217;t bother to evade; they stop their opponent from attacking at all. This card will, and you have my word on this, win you games. You pay 3 force to make the attacking unit -5 power. This is extremely good. There are only 3 characters (Anakin (A), Obi-Wan (A) and Yoda (A)), 3 ground units (Naboo Defence Station, Naboo Spaceport and Republic Attack Gunship UH-478) and 2 space units (Naboo Cruiser and Republic Assault ship) that have base power of 6 or more. In other words, most of the time they will be rolling 0 dice. If that isn&#39;t damage prevention, I don&#39;t know what is. This card also goes by the name of &#8220;Jango&#8217;s Gift&#8221;, because it will make Jango &#8230; well, not die.<br>
<br>
Dark Speed x 3<br>
Holy crap (I don&#8217;t actually worship ), this card is good. First, the card costs nothing. By &#8220;nothing&#8221; I mean absolutely nothing. It&#8217;s free. Free, as in &#8220;it costs nothing&#8221;. Second, it gives a unit +30 speed until end of turn. What do you know; my Destroyer Droid Squad has 70 speed. See that AT-TE Walker 23X? You won&#8217;t be seeing it much longer ;) This card will help you win games, no doubt (*cough*repeat*cough*). Another thing is that is can be used everywhere. This is versatility, and versatility is good.<br>
<br>
Strength of Hate x 3<br>
For two force, you get +3 power. A good card, and combined with Jango or Tyranus you are almost sure to kill off a Jedi even though they try to evade. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to the Strength of Hate, and Strength of Hate leads to killing off stuff. This is the way of the DS decks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mission (2 cards):<br>
<br>
Capture Obi-Wan x 2<br>
Pay two build points. Your opponent loses two force. You gain two force. Capture Obi-Wan is the key card to the Force Choke strategy. As said before, if you can get one of these out in round one, you might be able to kill Anakin/Yoda/Obi-Wan before they get enough force to just sit around and evade all day long. With those two extra force you can afford a Strength of Hate, A Tyranus&#8217;s Wrath and have one force left. The sound you now are hearing is the sound of me smiling happily.<br>
<br>
Splinter the Republic x 1<br>
For one build point, you get to search your deck and take a unit into hand. There has to be a unit with the same name in an arena. While this card is primarily for getting another card in the stack, you can also use it to getting out another Luxury Airspeeder or Destroyer Droid.<br>
<br>
Return to Spaceport x 1<br>
While it&#8217;s cool to see big things blow up, it&#8217;s not cool to see your own things blow up. Costing only one build point, Return to Spaceport will remove four damage counters from one of your ground units. Prime target: Trade Federation Battleship Core or the Geonosian Defense Platform. The Destroyer Droid Squads might also need to Return once in awhile.<br>
<br>
<br>
