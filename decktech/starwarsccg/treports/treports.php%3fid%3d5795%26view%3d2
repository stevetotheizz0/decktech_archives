<br />
part one: preparation for the event<br />
<br />
so it turns out me joe and kyle are going to make this.  joe has been playing lots lately, he knows the decks, so i just trust his judgment and play decks he recommends.  i take my trm from worlds, change 3-4 cards, and bring it.  a week before the event, joe brings up this new style 3/2 deck with iitfys v choosing agent of evil, and i build it just in case.  for ds, i just asked joe, what&#39;s the best ds deck right now.  he says, entanglements.  so i play it.  he has a list, we talk it over, i suggest adding in officer m&#39;kay and deflector shield generators v to up the armor by 2, all pullable if you have praji going.  we also talk about a 2nd grabber.  in prep i played 0 games of swccg.  been playing magic locally, my swccg stuff isn&#39;t really sorted and the vslips aren&#39;t up to date.  so i just take one day and build my physical decks and hope to play some games with joe/kyle on friday.<br />
<br />
<br />
part two: the trip<br />
<br />
leading up to the trip, my week was super busy.  i had wood floors installed at my house that week, so everything was all crazy anyway.  and my wife was busy so i had to pack myself (wives are generally key for packing, but not this time).  and i had like 100 things to do at work before i could go.  but i make it happen and head out to kyle&#39;s thursday night, park there, play 2 games of dominion with him (first two games of dominion ever, great game tho), and get a ride to the airport from his roommate.  get on the plane, sleep like the entire way, had one stop in houston where i met up with joe olson who happened to be on the same connecting flight to philly and slept the entire flight that time too.  so we arrive in philly, kyle was waiting for us, we get the shuttle to the hotel and we arrive.  lady at the front desk lets us check in early and playtesting starts.  <br />
<br />
part three: the playtesting<br />
<br />
i didn&#39;t play any real playtesting games.  i played 2 games with the 3/2 deck and decided it wasn&#39;t for me.  switch back to trm, put in the super home one package instead of 2x tantive etc, so my space ended up being 1x hcf v and 1x home one, with 1x ackbar v and 3x rebel leadership v.  had to take out my 3rd wookiee win for it which was upsetting but it&#39;s all good.  fit in we&#39;re doomed and occupation canceler which was great.  played 0 games with trm and 0 games with entangelements.  trm i&#39;m not worried about, but i&#39;ve literally never played a game of swccg with ie v at this point.<br />
<br />
part four: the main event<br />
<br />
ok here we go.  go down to the main event room and after decklists are turned in, gemme is waiting for revealsies.  we do 1 card from each side.  i reveal tawss khaa v for light and sergeant barich for dark.    he reveals han courageous smuggler and one of the ds political effects.  i am immediately upset.  my trm isn&#39;t playing ANY senate counters - no scrambled trans v and no civil disorder v.  i obv have evac control v, and certain cards that are good vs senate (but i can&#39;t pull) like tawss khaa v and stuff, but no real senate hate at all.  crap.  i do revealsies with someone else and reveal sgt barich again, funny.  <br />
<br />
match 1 vs john anderson<br />
<br />
i played john anderson day 1 at worlds last year, he was decent so i&#39;m slightly worried.  also i&#39;m sure he put me on trm so he&#39;s prolly ready for that.  i play ds first (forgot i got to choose honestly).  <br />
<br />
game 1 - my ie v against his wys<br />
<br />
turn 1 i pull sites and play guys to the ship site.  early on he just comes at the devastator with falcon/chewie/han courageous smuggler adding destinies to power and trying to outpower me.  works a few times but i just peel cards or forfeit a guy and keep piling guys on the ship, so eventually i&#39;m outpowering him and immune to attrition.  he moves away to kessel.  i set up on the ground and follow him around to stop his kessel drain.  he doesn&#39;t do much to me.  he gets melas at the cantina, i have grond loop.  he&#39;s retrieving 1-2 a turn but i&#39;m doing 2-3 damage a turn, so i&#39;m whittling him down.  he&#39;s not really actually doing any damage to me.  the game predictably goes to time and i win with 16 life force to his 14, for a win of 2.  if i have 30 more minutes i&#39;m sure ie v wins this by like 10 or so, but not much could be done here.  we both played decently fast, the matchup just will time out a lot i think.<br />
<br />
game 2 - my trm vs his tto<br />
<br />
as soon as i see his start my heart kinda skips a little, this could go BADLY for me.  tto just does too much damage, i have a small space fleet, absolutely NO CHANCE to blow the d*2, and not much to kill his at-at&#39;s with.  but fortunately for me, this game is the textbook &quot;how to beat tto with trm&quot; example.  <br />
<br />
turn 0 corran to the bunker, two twixes from hand<br />
turn 1 jedi survivor to bunker, jedi luke to endor db, speak to pull jcc<br />
turn 2 drain and draw into super home one stuff, etc etc<br />
<br />
also on his turn 0 he activated both db&#39;s so no jerjerrod, then his turn 1 he got the wrong sector cause the first was activated.  no endor shield all game meant he was somewhat low on imperials.  so lots of things worked well for me.<br />
<br />
he eventually does go to space with accuser and the tat db with veers/walker/jerjerrod forfeit fodder.  i atrocity his drain of 2, he controls, i sense (he forgot the lose 2 sense shield).  he lets it go, then smartly plays the sense shield before controlling my atrocity again then declaring tto damage.  i was hoping my atrocity would stick but oh well.<br />
<br />
i eventually clear his walker late game just by tracking a 6 every turn for bd and throwing guys at him, he forfeits jerjerrod, then thrawn, then he&#39;s out of dudes and the walker dies.  at that point i&#39;m fairly confident i win the game.  i think it was by 10 or 14ish.<br />
<br />
2-0<br />
<br />
match 2: MIKE GEMME<br />
<br />
this is the big leagues.  everyone is mocking me for playing mike gemme, which is pretty funny actually.  mike is a class act.  really funny guy, and a good swccg player, obv.  i mean, 3 worlds top 8&#39;s, origins winner back in the day when origins was a big deal, etc etc.  first mpc i attended i had to play a ktod (justin) and got stomped, i think this time i have at least a shot, but i&#39;m NOT looking forward to this ds senate matchup.  before the game i talk to joe olson and get some advice.  he says, go to space with super home one, force gemme to devote lots of resources to kill it, which he eventually will, that will at least reduce his diff in the win a little, and then entanglements can try to beat his wys to win the match.  i&#39;m not optimistic.<br />
<br />
game 1: his ds senate vs my trm<br />
<br />
before the game i let him look through my ipod and select my music for the match.  he picks my one oasis album (wonderwall one), great selection.  ok here&#39;s the game, this one is a doozy<br />
<br />
i start insurrection combo, quick draw v and evac control v.  stacking sai&#39;tor kal&#39;fas v on it, along with tawss khaa v.  doh.<br />
<br />
my opening hand is ok.  i think i had a twix and threepio turn 1, with a 1/0 db (love drawing this in opening hand, grr).  i draw for more stuffs.  he has no lott dod which is REAL nice for me.  i think he flips on his 2nd turn.  my 2nd turn i play another twix, and put admiral ackbar v at the home one war room.  draw 1 card, it&#39;s the home one!  sweet.  he flips but still doesn&#39;t find lott dod.  he&#39;s without lott dod until like turn 6 and doesn&#39;t EVER find the hovercam.  he eventually gets all 4 poli effects out, obv, and gets 5 dudes at the senate, including toonbuck and 4 ambitions.  ugh.<br />
<br />
my turn 2 as i said was ackbar to the home one war room.  my turn 3 is home one to his naboo, luke jk piloting (have his saber but dont play it cause i dont have the ajr anyway), put ackbar on as a pilot and 3p0 as a passenger.  his turn 3 i don&#39;t think anything happens.  my next turn i play mace windu v as a passenger on the home one, jedi survivor v as a passenger on the home one (gemme reads him), jedi saber on mace from hand, move home one to tatooine, shuttle mace and jedi survivor down.  so suddenly i&#39;m on 2 bg&#39;s draining 2 and 4 and he has to do something or i&#39;ll be able to get a drain through every turn in space.  i&#39;m holding a blaster deflection in hand and dreading the epp maul at the site killing the survivor turning the site back into a non-bg.  <br />
<br />
he comes down in space however, dropping three matching ship combo&#39;s on my home one.  can&#39;t really remember who (maybe zuckuss v in ship v and fel in saber 1).  he battles, i pick up tawss khaa v from evac control, he adds 4 to attrition and we draw bd.  i draw a 5 (as i do for like every single battle this game btw, wow) and he draws a 3.  so his 7 attrition i&#39;m immune to, and he has to forfeit something (fel).  he runs away.  i drain, he cancels the site drain with tarkin&#39;s orders and the system drain with the poli effect.  i play tawss khaa v to the site which is huge, and move home one in front of his ships.  he drops another ship and battles.  i pick up a card from evac control and we have a repeat of last battle, i draw a 5 and he draws a 3, i&#39;m immune and outpower him and he&#39;s not immune and forfeits something.  he runs away.  i drain 4, uncancellable.  i move in front of his ships after adding lando scoundrel to the home one.  he adds another ship and dude and battles, same result.  he doesn&#39;t run away at this point (he had saber 1 for forfeit fodder so he has like 2 ships and dudes still).  i drain 4 uncancellable and battle.  i play rebel leaderships to add a bd, he&#39;s only getting 1.  i have cards tracked thanks to wookiee win and 3p0 and stuff, so my 4 bd&#39;s are all 5&#39;s.  which zuckuss v turns into 3&#39;s.  but 4 3&#39;s is pretty good.  and i think he had vader too so one of them was a 1.  but that&#39;s 10 attrition, and as long as i hit 7 attrition he has to lose two cards or something good like vader.  he doesn&#39;t bother subtracting 3 with his poli effect cause 10 or 7 attrition net the same thing for him.  he forfeit&#39;s, i don&#39;t have to cause iirc he draw a 1 for bd or something, so even with +4 attrition and +3 from his poli effect he can&#39;t break my immunity.  home one is pretty good i guess.<br />
<br />
the game is really over at this point.  i add epp qui-gon to  my site for fear of the epp maul beat.  i use wokling to retrieve something.  i never had to forfeit a card in this game, in space or on the ground (we never fought on the ground i guess).  i win by 25 with like a 10 card hand left over after playing my 2 used interrupt.<br />
<br />
so i never thought that was possible.  no scrambled, no civil.  but i never game him any icons and he never got hovercam nor the +2 generation at bg senator, so he was super choked all game, and my constant pressure in space was too much for him.  he never even had enough to put 2 cards back (i was keeping a big hand so this wasn&#39;t going to hurt me much anyway).<br />
<br />
we take 5 and play game two<br />
<br />
game two: my ie v against his wys<br />
<br />
this game was crazy too.  i don&#39;t think i got praji this game (or maybe that was vs sokol?  i dunno).  which sucks.  anyway, he did like NOTHING for the first 10 turns basically.  so he had a HUGE hand and a HUGE force pile and i was scared to really deploy much to the ground.  i get my ship set up with guys and the +1 armor dude, i flip and consolidate, etc etc.  he gets melas to the cantina, fairly typical.  eventually he goes two dudes and the walker to a site.  i own it with the at-st guns and spread to two sites.  this was my huge huge mistake tho.  because instead of killing his walker with my at-st guns, i should&#39;ve DEPLOYED SPACE VADER.  instead, he uses medium transport to blow up my devastator.  oops.  suddenly the game went from &quot;wow i&#39;m totally going to win without any trouble&quot; to &quot;holy crap i&#39;m going to give away this match.&quot;  i put devastator and 3 pilots in the lost pile and the site and 3 dudes into the used pile.  during his draw phase i put something special planned for them v in the lost pile to retrieve devastator v.  he didn&#39;t flip me back so during my control phase i activate up to the devastator, take it into hand, redeploy it, pull the site again, play thrawn to the site, and say go.  he was spread to 2 systems so he couldn&#39;t really overpower me in space.  i think i got domination v going in this game too, so i was trying to retrieve guys like praji/grond/etc.  my next turn i drain on the ground, drop space vader as a pilot with the two biker scouts.  i chase him around in space, following and battling on my turns.  he&#39;s getting to that point where he&#39;s right at 25 life force (he already had to use on the edge from lost also so he&#39;s pretty much out of retrieval).  at some point i have thrawn/vader piloting and the biker scouts at the site, at tatooine.  he has like 2 ships with 2 pilots on 1 and luke on red 5.  he moves luke to kessel.  i follow.  he doesn&#39;t move the other ship.  i don&#39;t know why.  i guess he didn&#39;t expect what was next.  i use my tracked 6 and 5 to blow out luke for overflow.  he prolly thought i didn&#39;t have good destiny left or whatnot.  but i did.  at this point he loses luke and ship and has to peel like 5 cards, from life force cause his hand is tiny.  it occurs to me that i&#39;ve won the match, basically.  wow.  we goldenrod around in game for a few more turns and time is called.  i have the board controlled (imo) and he has 16 life force to my 14, but it doesn&#39;t matter cause i win the match.  wow.<br />
<br />
match 3: matt sokol<br />
<br />
between these matches i&#39;m sitting talking to someone, and i notice matt and gemme sitting talking to each other.  i&#39;m like &quot;oh great sokol will know my decks&quot; which i honestly don&#39;t really care much about but then i overhear gemme telling sokol some story about a girl.  i guess that&#39;s more interesting than my decks.  =)<br />
<br />
sokol is a great dude.  super nice, great sense of humor.  we&#39;ve played maybe 3 times already.  match play 2 years ago, we played and he beat my mwyhl with hd by 16 (cause of stupid much anger in him) then i beat his hbx with fear by 17.  then he beat me last year at worlds on his way to his 2nd worlds top 8.<br />
<br />
game 1: his isb tat occupation drop & drain vs my trm<br />
<br />
not a great matchup for him.  he goes ballsy though which i respect.  my turn 0, i get what is generally regarded as a horrid starting hand, no twixes in hand or force pile, but i got 3p0 so i guess horrid is overstating it.  i pull saitor and a db and play 3p0 and say go.  he plays like 5 locations and says go.  i 3p0 and i think get 1 twix and draw cards. i really don&#39;t 3p0 much this game, cause my hand is always like PERFECT.  he plays 5 isb dudes at 5 sites thanks to nightfall v, and darth maul cloaks at the system with occupation.  wow.<br />
<br />
my starting hand in other matchups would&#39;ve been bad, but a no twix starting hand here was also a huge character hand.  which is great.  so i drop mace on one site and tawss khaa v on another, two battles, cancel his barrier, he has to topdeck a few for the tawss khaa battle and ghhhk the other.  i move my guys together for fear of the beats and say go.<br />
<br />
he drains/occupys for a total of like 11 but i had 2 atrocities so i only had to lose like 5.  he does some drawing i think.<br />
<br />
i play two more dudes and have two more battles.  he&#39;s one one site now, i&#39;m on one also.  he damages me, draws or somethign.  eventually he goes big to his two sites with the droid at each and like 3-4 guys so i can&#39;t just do a solo epp hit and run or i&#39;d lose big overflows.  at some point he drops zimh and stops cloaking.  i drop super home one with jedi luke piloting alongside ackbar.  he gets blown out and has to start cloaking again.  i drop leia reb princess and i&#39;m draining decently, and the battle damage and cards on table has his life force real low.  so it&#39;s looking like another win of 20 for my trm.  then i make a huge bonehead play, drop kiffex and hcf.  in my head i&#39;m thinking &quot;two more damage a turn!  yay&quot; and then he just moves maul in front of it, i forgot maul had like hyperspeed 6.  duh.  so instead of +2 damage a turn, it&#39;s -2 damage a turn and +2 damage for him.  wow.  i can&#39;t find we&#39;re doomed until real late so i get a win of 6.  should&#39;ve been more like 18 if i don&#39;t play dumb.  oh well.  <br />
<br />
game two: my ie v against his trm wookiee win<br />
<br />
uh-oh, wookiee win trm is bad for me.  he doesn&#39;t get some cheap ship turn 0 to kill my devastator luckily, and i get derdram in opening hand.  i think he got a slow start, he doesn&#39;t do a whole lot early.  he does go battle plains with quiggy and il19 there to start damage.  i get space solid then go to ground and flip.  his turn 0 wookiee win had revealed free ride combo which is bad for me and he took it.  so i&#39;m upset about the occupation thing.  so mid game i&#39;m drawing, i draw my occupation which i know will just go to lost pile, so i keep drawing, next card is occupation #2.  sweet.  i play occupation, grab free ride, play next occupation next turn.  he plays princess leia v with her gun in front of my at-st with guns, which is bad for me.  i play the we have a prisoner combo to put a guy on the devastator, looking through my like 7 card reserve deck and see 2 AO&#39;s, 2 5&#39;s and 3 other cards.  so i shuffle it up and try to trample leia.  i play it, hoping he doesn&#39;t have a sense.  he doesn&#39;t.  i draw....the AO.  she&#39;s lost.  that&#39;s huge.  he plays jedi luke and sabotage on my guns.  draws a 4, i get all excited and he points at il19 so my guns go lost.  not to worry, i play another guns and shoot down luke next turn after firing repeatedly and lose two to make him lost.<br />
<br />
i get some luck this game, i&#39;ll admit it.<br />
<br />
1) the trample on leia - this was huge<br />
2) drawing both occupations after seeing his grab free ride<br />
3) he topdecks at least 2 atrocities (maybe 3) so my occupations were never reduced at all<br />
4) he topdecks kiffex early and can never get it<br />
<br />
so this game was super close for a long time but then i was suddenly doing like 7 damage a turn and just barely pulled it out, full win by 4.<br />
<br />
great match, i win both games to advance.<br />
<br />
match 4 vs reid smith<br />
<br />
reid is good.  he clownstomps me.<br />
<br />
game 1, his trm vs my ie v<br />
<br />
he starts for luck v which is HUGE.  he goes to space early and often, with like 18 ships that are in his deck.  i get imp justice to stop his bright hope tricks.  but he&#39;s putting some real pressure on in space.  i topdeck godherdt which upsets me.  i never get praji which upsets me.  i go to the ground and flip successfully which is great.  i draw space vader and am happy, then he drops flash of insight v and searches for a db, showing me his 5 card reserve deck including medium transport v (CRAP), 2 5&#39;s (which hit my 6 armor), a 4 and something else.  i successfully don&#39;t cut the transport to the top.  but i cut the 4 to the top.  he edges for 3.  then the top is...medium transport.  he 3p0&#39;s it into hand.  the top is now...a 5.  he play it, battles, and blows up the dev.  i lose.  instead of instantly drawing up i play 3 more turns, letting him pad his diff by at least 5-8 forces.<br />
<br />
game 2, my trm vs his rops<br />
<br />
this game was a lot more fun.  we have some witty banter, he jokingly declares that he&#39;s not only going to win the match, but also win the GAME so now i have a secondary goal: to be the only person to beat reid smith in a game of star wars today.  he activates decently.  i get a good start with twixes and stuff.  i go to space with hcf, move it to ralltiir to stop the flip.  he goes emp palpy + myn kneugh v to a site.  i roflstomp them with mace windu v, i guess he was hoping i&#39;d miss emp on the swing?  but i didn&#39;t.  he should&#39;ve asked mike gemme if i ever drew 1&#39;s or 2&#39;s for destiny.  i add jedi survivor v to drain a bunch.  i move hcf to his fondor for battle order.  he lights up my hcf with justifier + motti, i lose some cards to keep hcf out then re-beat him with super home one.  he forfeits motti and runs away.  he then flips which is upsetting.  my next turn is like the perfect turn.  he saves no force (oops?) and i drop draw their fire, drop two guys at two sites, battle twice, retrieve forces, kill his stuff.  but i can&#39;t flip him back.  grr.  at this point in the game my attitude goes from &quot;eh i have no chance of winning this match&quot; to &quot;holy crap i might win this match.&quot;  and i think he&#39;s def thinking that too.  next 5 turns are super close, a few battles, etc etc, i drain a bunch, but eventually not playing the rops shield meant two different turns i was like 2 force short of flipping him back (cause my rebels would deploy +2 so i couldnt drop corran to flip him).  so i win by 24 with one card left in hand, and lose the match.<br />
<br />
i&#39;m a little upset, cause if i drew up earlier in game 1 i might have a shot at the match, or if i played the rops shield i might have a shot at the match, but the truth is, reid just won fair and square.  he was a class act.  the one real nice thing about playing reid is, he&#39;s 100% by the book.  every action is declared, everything is clear, every reserve deck is shuffled so there&#39;s never any guesswork whether someone is tryin to do anything shady, etc.  i def appreciated that.  in fact, all my opponents were just class acts.  this is nice.  i mean, in other games there&#39;s tons of jerks.  swccg is sweet cause the people playing are just flat out cool people.<br />
<br />
anyway that&#39;s basically it.  i made top 8 which no one expected.  the next fews days consisted of magic drafting, swccg cube drafting, LOTS of dominion, eating bad food, and hanging out with awesome people.<br />
