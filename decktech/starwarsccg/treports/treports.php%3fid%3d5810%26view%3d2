<br />
<b>Game 1 Bill Kafer’s ISB</b><br />
I actually don’t remember what Bill starts. I think it was Den of Thieves but it definitely wasn’t Resistance. I don’t insert for a while but Bill can’t really do a whole lot yet and eventually deploys Hoth and the 5th Marker with a Presence there. It takes me 3 turns to insert and then I drop Draw Their Fire, Bacta Tank and Luke with saber and kill some guys and for get to put Luke in the Tank! Oops. Bill gets a dreadnaught in space but can’t find anymore more. I cancel that drain and spread with other corvettes with Hyper Escape and Spiral just in case. He draws into his Resistance but having trouble staying on 3 battlegrounds. Obi is battling on the ground and I put him in the tank. Bill gets hit by the inserts and gets down quick but he keeps on forgetting to retrieve ISB agents. I finally get more ships and battle him in space with Luke and clear out his 3rd battleground. Numbers hits him and that is game.  <br />
<br />
<b>Game 2 vs Mike Kesseling’s HB numbers</b><br />
First game I get to play against my buddy Mike. Well that is disheartening. I debate on the effect I should start and ask if you have cheese? Mike being the nice guy he is just says my other deck is more cheese. Believing him and totally getting mind blown by his rosey red cheeks I start Secret Plans instead of Resistance. My opening hand is complete crap and only get Vader. I think I run 19 imperials! I activate 2 and draw for some. Nothing. His turn, he deploys 4 x-wings to Rendezvous Point. There goes my Monnok x2  idea. I deploy another site, no twixes to be seen. I draw all 5 of my force. No imperials or activation. Wonderful. He deploys three droids and inserts. I have Blizzard Scout 1 in my hand so maybe I can deploy that and trample something. I activate. Everything good was in my reserve deck. I decide just to deploy Vader. By this time, he is set up with 99 x-wings all spread out like Kevin Shannon’s mom. I activate and numbers pop, then lose 14. I can literally do nothing besides play Piett. He drains for a couple. I have no ships either. Numbers pop again and I lose 12. He inserts again and I concede. Great format. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 3 vs Angelo Consoli’s ISB Big Blue </b><br />
I can’t remember what Angelo started but it wasn’t resistance. I immediately think I have this game in the bag. My opening hand is horrible as I don’t have and any capitals. I have Gold Leader in Gold 1 so I decide to drop that and a guy and insert. Several turns go by before the insert goes off and Angelo only loses 3 or so. I finally find another ship and get some idiots aboard like Wioslea and 8D8. However, by this time Angelo has set up the Executor and another Star Destroyer with Tarkin and Darth Vader aboard. I can’t mess with that and the Executor is too good to do anything to so I have to run away the entire time. When he drops the ISD with Vader and Tarkin aboard I try to Hyper Escape away but he has the nuts against me… tarkins orders. I lost some stuff to battle damage including Wioslea and forgot to put him on the tank. I don’t have any other high destiny characters in my hand so the numbers finally go off and he only 8. I insert again and hits him for another 8 but I am out of tricks and his space is too good. I get more high destiny characters but he plays torture on me to which I have to grab. This is the golden moment and saves him from defeat. I insert again and he has probed 6 systems and is making his way towards Ralltiir for the last unprobed system. He has Piett aboard the Executor and has been pulling probe droids. Once he probed he retrieved 4!  I have never seen this before. I have losing 12 to 8 or so but I can’t do anymore damage because I couldn’t find any ships. The last inserts never popped because he would activate 1 and search with Piett and shuffle and activate 2 and move. If that goes off I might pull off a win but it isn’t meant to be. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 4 vs Vince Elia’s HB</b><br />
Vince tells me he hasn’t played the game since 1998 and he is borrowing decks from his brother. I start Resistance this time. I will be starting Resistance every time I play in this format or something similar to it. I go by deploying some sites and a twix I had in my hand. Vince deploys a system and draws. I deploy more sites and draw. Vince plays a corvette somewhere and some pilots but that isn’t Ralltiir. My turn I flip and sit tight. Vince deploys some more corvettes to his system and moves over to Coruscant and gets ready to flip himself. I search for ships with my objective and ping him. Vince can’t do any real damage and moves ships around and try to find the big drains. I deploy the executor and Bossk in hounds tooth with guys and battle him away with my huge battle destinies. Vince runs around from my fleet and finally flips. I probe fairly quickly and the damage is rolling with me controlling almost every single location on the board. Another turn and I am telling him good game. Hopefully, we have another one of these events and he comes out for it as well. I think he has the coolest mustache I have ever seen. Better than the one Sam Elliot sported from Tombstone.  <br />
<br />
<b>Game 5 vs Keith Brown’s HB Numbers</b><br />
Again, I will never start another effect besides Resistance in this format, so that is what I did in this particular situation as well. He started Haven on Rendezvous Point so I was actually thinking his deck was like mine. I start with some activation in my opening hand so that is nice, in addition, I also have Imperials! He doesn’t do a whole lot on his first couple of turns as neither do I. Just before I flip he does insert and plays a whole bunch of high destiny characters like Oola, Wedge and so on. I can’t remember if he occupied a non-BG for Resistance yet but numbers didn’t pop and I deployed three imperials just in case. He deploys some more ships to good locations and draws a bunch. I spend the force looking for starships every turn and grabbed Executor as soon as I could. Bossk in Hounds tooth is amazing in this environment but not being to hold a pilot really hurts him. I take a couple of drains here and there and he finally chooses to battle on the ground with some randoms and flips me back. I quickly flip back and I don’t probe Yavin IV when I have the chance. I move away and start searching for his base while dealing with drains in space at Death Star and my converted Coruscant. He deploys a landing claw on his Red squadron x-wing that is causing headaches. Stopping my Executor drain and then draining at that location after I move is really annoying. One turn, after my activation phase I said I am moving to my control phase and said if that was ok and Keith replied ‘OK.’ I then go to deploy a Dreadnaught and go for the game ending beatdown but he says he will attach. I reminded him that he said ‘OK’ already but I grow a heart and let him attach. My hand soon gets low in cards and he was using Oola every chance he got so I couldn’t do anything to stop his scrubs on Ralltiir. I think I tracked and drew Darth Vader with Saber like 3 times and then just gave up tracking. With him and I being flipped for over 10 turns, it wasn’t producing much damage. Finally, after probing what seemed to be 15 systems, I probed Yavin IV and sure enough it was the Hidden Base. Unfortunately for me, time was called and he has around 12 to around my 10.  I think I definitely win but I needed 3 more turns. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 6 vs Kevin Elia’s 3rd Marker start</b><br />
Kevin starts Presence of the Force with Twi’lek. He deploys General Veers first turn. I deploy a system 1 from hand, a corvette, 2 droids and insert. He drains and draws. I play more systems, another droid and get ready for the flip and build my hand. Honestly, with HB numbers you don’t have to even think. Numbers pop and he has to lose 10 or something stupid. He draws assuming to find ships. I deploy an epp and find and clear the 3rd marker and deploy another ship and drop several systems. All of these HB numbers games are actually blending together because I played with and against it so much. <br />
<br />
I prepared for this format more than worlds so I am highly disappointed in my performance at 3-3. Oh well. I played all 6 games with or against Hidden Base and 5 with of them with numbers, I think this environment is pretty stupid. <br />
<br />
<big>WORLDS TEAM TOURNAMENT</big><br />
<br />
<b>Game 1 vs Mike Pistone’s Ralops</b><br />
I heard some reports saying how this game could take several hours so I was hoping this wouldn’t be one of them. I blow up the shields with ease and spend all my other efforts on getting rid of Mike’s imperials in Ralltiir. He flipped for a brief time but I flipped him back with a ship and Dash aboard. I killed Darth Vader Betrayer and Tarkin V about 4 times. I am sending rogues everywhere and they are dying like good meats but his Domination is keeping him in this game for way too long. I finally spread to several locations and he has since destroyed my ship and I never deploy anything to space again. I need all the force to take rogues back and battle to keep him flipped. He finally runs out of guys and me from draining at the +1 site and he concedes.<br />
<br />
Robbie lost to Brian Hollingworth’s QMC which, Robbie said, is his hardest matchup. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 2 vs Chris Menzel’s ASM</b><br />
This supposed to be a good matchup for me at Texas States I didn’t know what half of my cards did and lost. I won’t be making those same mistakes again. His turn he just gets some stuff out and draws. I deploy three rogues and wait for the opposition. His turn he just deploys a droid squad to the chambers and moves over. Luckily for him my Corran and Tycho were activated when I flipped. I move all three over to the drain +1 site and draw a bunch. He deploys Victory and Boba in Slave 1 V to Coruscant. I retaliate with HCF and Tantive with plenty of Rogues for forfeit and I steal his Victory. He tries to battle on the ground and occasionally has some tricks like close call v and others but nothing really hurts me while he is losing many things. He thinks for a good while trying to weigh his options. He goes for the flip but my rogues make short work and anything he throws on the ground and I eventually move “Palpatine” back to his chambers. I think I stole another ship and Chris just conceded. <br />
<br />
Robbie lost to Angelo so we are 2-2. Not looking good. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 3 vs Mike Gemme’s Spice</b><br />
We both have to read all of our cards for like 10 minutes and after reading all of his cards I still didn’t know what was going on. I blame James Barnes for not telling me what spice does. Thanks, some friend you are. Once we get our opening hands there is only 30 minutes in the round remaining so we decide to finally start playing. Mike doesn’t do a whole lot first turn besides get some activation and more cards. My turn I deploy some rogues and draw a couple. He deploys a ship to Kessel with the drain +1 admiral. I know his name but I don’t feel like looking to spell his name correctly.  I blow up the thing and I get lucky and have Leia v in my hand so I wait for him to deploy Veers down. Meanwhile I deploy some more rogues and some ships to Coruscant to setup Celebration. His turn he deploys Veers and Blizzard 1. I deploy Leia and some schmucks and attack. He has a command for me but I do my damage and Veers is lost. I save some force because I already had a huge hand and was trying to save differential. His turn he gets back Veers and I randomly read his site about using 3 and I say I have an action after you stack Veers right? He says yes so I use three and poop him. After that Mike can’t really do anything to me on the ground. He is eating big time drains of 8 and not doing any damage to me. I attack him and steal a ship. He attacks me with some tracked destinies but his efforts seem pointless with infinite rogues. I finally drain him out. <br />
<br />
Robbie just beat Justin Desai’s profit by Set for stunning the lateral damage fish and causing 19 overflow next turn! We are now 4-2 and might be able to sneak into the finals. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 4 vs Jarad Konsker’s Endor Ops</b><br />
Jarad is playing Damp toes so I am hoping I can get my ships out and actually do something against his awesome space. He lets me go first by starting Palpatine on the table. I find this extremely nice of him, so I deploy some rogues and say go. His turn he plays a guy to the DB and moves palpatine over. My turn I blow up the shields and play luke and gun to his site. I shoot the place up like Sonny Corleone and the site is cleared. He plays some space. I play some space and battle and it isn’t looking so good already for him. I am out activating him by a bunch and he can’t get anything on the ground together. He battles with Maul with lightsaber several times but after I cancel the BD and field dressing it doesn’t much. I redeploy the rogues and he tries again. Same thing and Maul takes a couple of overflow every time. He deploys a couple of other ships and drains me once but I eventually drain him out thanks to my objective adding drains to his Endor. <br />
<br />
Robbie lost his game to Keith Brown, (surprise, surprise) so we end up going 5-3 and I have no idea where we placed. This COT deck is really good and I decide to run with it instead of Rebel Senate tomorrow and hope I don’t play the many walkers decks running around. I think Rogues and communing are going to be popular so I decide on Double D Invasion. <br />
<br />
<big>DAY 2 WORLDS</big><br />
<br />
<b>Game 1 vs Jan Westergard’s LS Senate</b><br />
We were informed that we were the runner-up feature match so that is cool. Before the game starts there were many announcements including Scott’s life-time achievement award to which he was tearing up. Scott, you are amazing and thanks for all of the support over the years. You are one of the best people I know. <br />
<br />
The game finally gets underway and I ask Jan if he has his Naboo Senate and he says yea, you have Invasion and I say yea. Funny, we know each other so well. Jan and I have played each other close to 7 times and he hasn’t beat me yet and I hope today is no different. I started You Cannot Hide Forever instead of 3,720 to 1 because I was expecting EPPs and I have to hit them because I won’t be drawing destiny every time to avoid beat-downs. I do the usual setup of getting site, Dofine and Viceroy. I think I get the bridge out as well so that will be huge. Jan’s turn just consists of deploying senators and searching for a docking bay to which is stuck in his used pile. This is significant because I get to verify and notice a Grimtaash. On my turn, I have no choice to draw a bunch and just pray he doesn’t Grimtaash. If I don’t draw I am stuck with very little options. He goes and gets some political effects. He uses three to get We’ll Take the Long way or hovercam. He draws and I am worried. He has 8 Force left. 6 Force left. 4 Force left. If he hits me I will lose 3 droids and 2 rolling rolling so basically jackpot for him. I asked if he got the Taash and he said no. He keeps drawing, I am assuming to still get it and play it used. He draws to 1 left. He exclaims he missed the escape pod. He is usually sincere but this could be a ploy, it is worlds after all. I immediately deploy all three droids to the battle plains. I don’t want to flip because HCF and effects would ruin my day, not until I have guri. She is eluding me. I always thought I was somewhat successful with the ladies but I guess Guri is a robot with an attitude and likes to tease. Jan sets up some annoying combos, like dodge and gets it back every turn with I’ll take the long way. I don’t grab for whatever reason. I guess I was saving for senate puller. Jan deploys Fallen Jedi at the throne room. That is going to be a big pain to deal with since I can’t shoot and his -3 bd text. That means I would need to draw a 5 to clear her. Something I can’t risk without tracking. It is slow going as I am paying to drain and him canceling it. I am slowly setting up my hand getting some juicy stuff while trying to avoid the inevitable Grimtaash. He comes down to battle with an epp once but I had Oh switch off or master destroyers usually. He is getting a little low on life-force, well not really low, but not enough to play characters, recycle his senators and put 3 back etc. 1 turn he deploys Miana and moves her over to a lone droid and tendau and Corran Horn. I elis P-59. Sniper Corran lose 2. Deploy another droid. Battle. Shoot with everyone and cause 6 more damage. That is the beauty of this deck. You don’t have to drain or satisfy BPlorder to deal plenty of damage. After that turn he feels defeated and is left with very life-force remaining. I finally grab his Might of the Republic. He senses something and that is another 3 life-force.  Fallen Jedi drained for 3 almost the entire game. Time is called and I win 20 to 7 or so. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 2 vs Chris Schoenthal’s HDv</b><br />
Chris and I have been to MANY tournaments together but I have never played him so this will be a treat. Chris shows HDv and I get a little excited because Rogues can handle fairly easy. Chris doesn’t deploy anything 1st turn and gets Endor. I deploy three rogues and wait for him to battle. He deploys Victory and Thrawn to Endor and draws. I waited for him to battle but I guess he was scared? I autoblow, get the JCC and just draw a bunch. He drains and I atrocity. He deploys the 3/2 site along with Grievous there. My turn I deploy I deploy a ship and some rogues to threaten a big drain. Draw. I projection. He doesn’t really do a bunch and draws a bunch. It is obvious he can’t find characters. I battle with Leia but she goes to the used pile. That was dumb I guess. I couldn’t find Luke or enough rogues to fight him. I draw some more. He finally tries to come down with Vader but I have Too Close for comfort, he draws low and I send a guy to the tank and he loses Vader. Battle Grievous try number 2 with Luke this time. I shoot but he force fields. He misses with a double 1. I draw destiny 1 and he draws destiny 1. I have a Houjix so I leave him there. His turn he goes for the beat with Myn and Dr E. I shoot him up and Houjix. He tries to battle with Galen somewhere else but is drawing nothing but 1’s. We look at his deck and he has like 8 destiny 1 characters out 10 cards. He says this is stupid and concedes. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 3 vs Bill Kafer’s Communing Jedi Luke’s Galore</b><br />
Bill is in the same situation of Jan, playing like 6-7 times over the years and has never beaten me. I have heard a lot about communing and saw several builds floating around including Socal’s so now I am a little worried and have no idea what to expect. He starts Quick Draw so it looks like chewies gun or something? I really have no idea. He seems confident in the game so we will see. I do my usual setup, including an extra site that was in my hand this time. I go for the extra icons because I heard rumors of communing getting ridiculous amounts of activation without giving any so I just roll with that information. Bill gets rolling and puts out Yoda, GW to my throne room. Guri finally decided to show her hotness to me but it looks like I won’t be flipping for a while. My turn I draw a bunch to try to fight Yoda. Bill gets out threepio so that will be annoying. He pulls Deficiency and bionic hand or journal. I can’t remember because he played all three of them more than 3 times. Jedi Luke comes down to join Yoda. I deploy P-60, and 2 non-uniques and battle. I shoot Yoda but miss with the others either because of bad destiny or the journal. I try to do something cool like sniper but he uses Yoda’s game-text. Fortunately, I have Crossfire out and I play self-destruct to keep 2 of em there. Bill uses yoda and track around to get some more crap to put on Luke and he battles with him. I miss but I out-power him so he forfeits Luke anyways. I have a lot of droids stacked so I try to put 1 or 2 back every turn. My turn I deploy Guri in ship and Bill elects to deploy cantina and try to drain there instead of Naboo. I deploy some guys and take care of Jedi Luke again. He plays Run Luke v and retrieves him. I finally flip and deploy forced servitude. He cancels with Wyron Serper v. He deploys another Luke. I battle him off and deploy Forced Servitude. He cancels with his 5th jedi Luke! Bill is getting down by a bunch and really can’t handle anything else with my big drains eating him up and my recurring droids are really annoying. I had trouble finding droids but in the end they prevail. Time was called but Bill just shakes my hand and my record is safe against Bill.    <br />
<br />
<b>Game 4 vs Kevin Shannon’s HDv</b><br />
I am going to use Mike Gemme’s commentary and edit it a bit and give insight on my decisions. <br />
<br />
Shannon deploys Choke Vader/stick to the power plant. I deploy Dressel and Commando Training/Klor’slug. I play Leia Rebel Princess and backs her up with a Veteran Rogue, both at the Lower Levels because I was afraid to put down 3 rogues to Vader’s location with Kevin flipped and being able to pull Sniper/Dark Strike and the capability of deploying another guy and causing big damage. He then would just retrieve the Sniper combo and do it every turn unless I grab it. Kevin pulls Endor. He then uses the black leader puller to pull her namesake. He then drops Black Leader on Galen’s ship to Endor.<br />
<br />
I just draw trying to find rogues to deal with Vader and tricks. Kevin drains and I decide to use Leia to cancel one drain and Atrocity to soak up the damage for the other drain. Kevin takes a few minutes before dropping General Nevar V and searching with him to see what’s in his deck. Shannon then drops Palpatine’s quarters between the power plant and the lower levels. I activate and drop a projection of a Skywalker. He then drops Wedge, RSL to Palpatine’s quarters alone. I drop the Jedi Council Chamber on the other side of the power plant, then moves Leia and the veteran to join him. Shannon ends up dropping Mara with Lightsaber to the Lower Levels. At this point the 30 minute mark as already been called and I haven’t even blown up the shields! I drop Hobbie V in front of Vader. He then uses the Jedi Council Chamber to search for Yoda. Mike decides to play Yub Yub Commander for a Veteran Rogue and adds Ten Numb to the fracas. Instead of fighting, he simply moves Wedge, Leia and the other Veteran Rogue over in front of Vader. <br />
<br />
Shannon plays sniper on Leia. Cyborg Commander and his lightsaber joins Vader against the rebel weenies. Shannon battles, choking wedge and Hobbie tries to shoot Greivous, but force field blocks it (and gets grabbed). Vader goes for a swing at one of the rogues and a Too Close For Comfort stops the swing. Each of us draws a 1, leaving Shannon three behind on power. My deck was literally chock full of high destinies but Kevin uses the Force on me. He loses 3. I auto blow up the Main Power Plant. I then drop civil disorder V, Luke, Rebel Hero and Hobbie in front of Mara and battles. I don’t have the gun. For some reason I can’t find it and suspect it is the 1 Force I have been saving all game. I miss with Hobbie while Mara cuts up Luke. I had a better than 60% shot of hitting Mara and was hoping Kevin hadn’t found his ghhhk. KShan draws a 1 while I actually draw decent, a 5 which was what I was looking for with his gunshot. Power was 17 to 6, which means Mara and four. I battle Vader with Wedge, Ten and the rogues. I pull too close for comfort with We Wish to Board At Once. Wedge gets choked, too close stops the lightsaber swing on Ten Numb, but force push takes Vader out of the battle like a Scarlet Pimpernel. Thrawn comes down to help Vader battle the rogues. Shannon draws a 0 while Richards draws a 3. Shannon loses Thrawn and Vader is left facing off against two non-unique rogues. <br />
<br />
I play escape pod and in a sly move, when Shannon asks me if he can activate to it, I say I am one away, so he lets it resolve. However, I yank a projection out of my deck, meaning I can activate right up to the six. I drop Wedge Legendary Rogue and Hobbie to the site, then projection to Palpatine’s Quarters. He drops Leia V to the Lower Levels and Coruscant celebration in the sky. I play this without any ships because Kevin has a couple more life-force more than me and time was called for everyone else but we get 2 extra minutes for a ruling. If I had more time I would have gone to Endor with Dash and ship and block drains with recurring rogues. So my only hope is to get a beat in on Vader and hope he doesn’t have the ghhhk.  <br />
<br />
I battle and shoot Vader with Hobbie and hits with my tracked escape pod. I have 17 to 11, and Kevin of course has the Ghhhk. He deploys Victory and Vader to Coruscant. I try to come up with the most power but I can’t muster enough up. I deploy Obi Wan in Radiant 7 and Dash Rendar V and battle the lone victory. Myn Kneugh V and Tarkin hit palpatine’s quarters with Greivous. I can’t do anything and just concede. I look at my 1 Force I have been saving… and low and behold, it is Luke’s gun. Herold comes over and tells me I forgot about JCC canceling Grievous’ drain bonus. D’OH! I lose 16 to 12 or so. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 5 vs Mike Kesseling’s IOv</b><br />
Mike and I met for the first time at the MPC last year and we instantly hit it off. I really like his rosy red cheeks. So it was a total drag to play my buddy so early when we both had the same record. I know Mike’s deck really well and it is going to come down to luck on my destiny draws to be able to have a good game. I get an okay opening hand. He does his usual stuff and scans my hand and moves all of his stuff over. I deploy 2 Rogues and draw. He needs a 4 to blow it. He is successful and luckily my Atrocity sticks. He draws a bunch. I flip and he loses Alert My Star Destroyer and I feel a little hope inside. I grab Tycho and try to battle. He tramples Tycho and I grab. I draw a bunch. He deploys more forfeit fodder and gets ready for the onslaught of guys I am about to play. I play a lot of guys, battle and play yub yub. I draw decent and kill some stuff. At least he hasn’t found his Code Clearance to make his guys insane forfeit. His turn he has to run away away. I drain for as much as I can and deploy some ships and move guys around. He tramples another guy, flips and deploys a walker and gets his Alert back and deploys the Executor. I messed up as I should have deployed to Hoth to stop his -5 deploy. He is now sitting good and has plenty of walkers and there isn’t much I can do. He now has Imperial Decree in affect and I can’t handle his Executor with what I have in hand. We drain back and forth and I finally get Celebration out and I am slightly ahead. I replace Leia V with Rebel Princess to cancel some drains. Time is called during his turn. I do the math about 8 times and figure out I win by 2. The next day he realizes that Prepare for a surface attack stops his drains from being canceled. Oops. A very close game that could have gone anyway.   <br />
<br />
<b>Game 6 vs Chris Twigg’s COT</b><br />
My first turn I go to get Dofine and of course he isn’t in there. I have some droids in my hand so I decided to deploy 2 of em and try to delay the flip from him while I got other stuff set up. He uses Let the wookiee win during my turn and reveals Hobbie v and takes him. He also uses the Rogue Squadron Tactics to get Wedge RSL. He deploys those two and another guy and I am still okay since I have wounded warrior in my hand. He battles. Draws a blind 5 to hit one my droids. I shoot with a DD, only needing a 3 and with 3,720 to 1 out it makes it to where I only have 4 misses in my entire reserve deck.  I hit but for some reason I hold off on the wounded warrior. I guess I was thinking I wanted him to burn through more resources. I shoot again and draw one of my 4 misses in my deck. Great. He plays Yub Yub and draws something ridiculous and I have to peel 8 in overflow… first turn of the game! So he blind draws a 5 in which there are 10 in his deck and 2 of them were in his hand and I miss. I have to top-deck 6 or something and feel pretty disgusted. My turn I draw a bunch and my deck is already down to 16 life force on the second turn. Chris blows it up and I of course lose more force. He deploy 2 rogues at each location. I couldn’t find many droids when I drew 10 last turn so I can’t battle and just decide to quick flip and spread. He deploys some ships and gets out celebration. I definitely can’t come back from that. Also, I am having trouble finding my Forced Servitude. I have to find Maul and stop his Celebration if I have to win. I drain and do my best to claw my way back. Chris doesn’t feel threatened and really doesn’t do anything and he is pretty much sailing to victory and will be draining for 5. I finally get my Maul and Chris has 30 life Force compared to my 14 or so. He comes down to the Throne room and battles with a rogue, Corran and Lando Scoundrel. I stupidly try to sniper Lando causing myself even more Force loss when he is commando training combo out. At least it makes them forfeit = 0. I lose the Throne room but at least I am still flipped due to forfeiting shenanigans. I deploy Maul to Coruscant. I don’t cloak because he has been complaining the entire time about not finding Luke. Plus, I can’t afford to cloak or I lose anyways. Now he doesn’t get drain bonuses and he has to pay to drain. He moves his ships around to avoid Maul. I am now draining for 6 a turn and deploy Forced Servitude. He has to run away from me again and draws a couple. Now I am feeling I can come back and win this game. Drain for 5 and we are dead even in life-force! I spread to put on more pressure. It seems I have nothing but droids left in my life-Force because I can’t find any of them. Then he pulls a rabbit out of his hat and deploys Phylo Gandish V to a capital ship! In disgust, I yell to Matt Sokol telling him why in the hell does he have that card in his deck? He begins to tell me how he couldn’t beat HDv with YAB. I say Yub Yub is ten times better than Phylo V! Anyways, he battles in space and I forget to put a card in the lost pile because I was so distraught over Phylo. He barely has enough to take a rogue off deploy both and battle. If I put that BD out of play he wouldn’t be able to battle me anywhere. It comes down to the wire and with Forced Servitude out, I am able to get him down to 5. <br />
<br />
So close. I now have to win out to have a chance. I play tested this game against COT before and I won easily with the same strategy but I caused more than 3 direct damage as well. What can you do?<br />
<br />
<b>Game 7 vs Caleb Foth’s IOv</b><br />
Once Caleb’s name was said I immediately knew I would be playing LS. I look at the command card and of course I am. Wonderful another grind or so I thought. I get my hand and I fan through each card slowly and dramatically searching for the ITCB. No, no, nope and finally card number 8 is it! I couldn’t believe it. I was so joyous, I thought I can actually win this easily now. It wasn’t until a few moments later I noticed I didn’t have a single character in my hand. Hmmm that sounds cool. So Caleb looks at my hand and starts laughing. My turn I activate 8 and so go. He blows up the generators easily by controlling two sites and I atrocity for 3 and play ICBW for the other 5. I decide I don’t want him to flip early so I deploy Wedge aboard Radiant to Hoth. His turn he deploys Galen’s fighter with black leader and tarkin for like 1 Force total. I have to Houjix because he draws a 6, 5, 4 for battle destinies and I don’t even get my +1 from Declaration bc Wedge isn’t present. I deploy some guys to the plant. While he deploys 2 Walkers and 2 forfeit 8 or 9 guys and spreads! I try for Menace fades and go a ship to space and spread myself. He deploys Justifier and Pallaeon. Seriously? I concede. I was going to take 15 damage next turn or something ridiculous on me. So that officially knocks me out and I am bummed. This game took less than 10 minutes. Caleb mentioned later that was the dumbest game of swccg he has ever played. It was pretty close for me as well.  <br />
<br />
<b>Game 8 vs Andrew Moss’ RSTv </b><br />
I never read any of the RST cards and just let James tell me if it was good or not. He said it was okay so I have to be on my toes. I do my usual. It takes a while for me to read all of his cards so I tell him to play while I read but he insists to wait until I am finished. He pulls a bunch of stuff I have never seen and plays General Solo v to the bunker with 2 charges. He started Your Insight Serves You well and pulled something with it. Several turns later he realized 3,720 to 1 should have been canceled. Oops. I have a couple of droids in hand and ghhhk so I say alright lets try to battle and see what happens. I was fully expecting I know or something stupid but he plays I’ve decided to go back so that gets around my wounded warrior somewhat. He is still down in power so he has to burn his field dressing and I lose a droid. Leia is pissed off about her hubby and he battles and I don’t even try to shoot because he has all the buddy effects and has DV=29. He burns his I Know and has power 153 to my power 3. I am forced to Ghhhk. My turn I deploy Guri in ship and flip. I couldn’t find my forced servitude to soak up the damage from the bunker exploding next turn. He doesn’t do much but deploys some more sites and draws. I draw. He tries to fight but I fend him off with tricks. The damage is quickly catching up with him and he deploys Home 1 and moves over. I run away to Endor and play coward. He catches on to my antics and gets a little frustrated. He tries to spread to 2 sites and gets in some damage but I drain for free and now have Servitude going and he can’t do much to me. As a last ditch effort he consolidates his forces on Naboo and I know the Nabrun is coming next turn. I just reinforce and wait. He doesn’t have many tactics and mine get through and I stay alive and he is drained out.  <br />
<br />
So I go 5-3 and get 15th place still never making day 3 of worlds. I just can’t get over that last hump, not to mention, my horrible luck for the entire day that never seemed to escape me. If bad luck didn’t exist I wouldn’t have any luck at all. Hunter once said when he battles he expects his opponent to get all of his draws and he will miss all of his. Don’t battle otherwise. Seems like solid advice. I think I pretty much followed this advice the entire weekend. <br />
<br />
<big>WORLDS CONSOLATION</big><br />
<br />
<b>Game 1 vs Barry Alperstein’s IOv</b><br />
Great. I get like 4 hours of sleep and get pumped to play walkers first game. Also, I repeatedly heard ‘rounds’ this weekend and that is incorrect. A round is 2 games with Light and Dark. At least I get rogues in my opening hand this game which is okay. I switched out Projection for Honor this morning and it will be the card I pull when the MPGs are blown on 2nd turn, if on 3rd turn I pull ICBW. Barry does the usual stuff. I play two rogues. Barry of course blows the generators and I am stuck losing 9. That was fun. Fortunately I don’t lose horrible cards; well actually, I do, because the rogues are nothing but horrible cards. Barry deploys some more stuff on ground and I just get ready to get celebration and honor going on my turn. The shields blow up and Honor comes ripping out of my deck. I deploy a ship and move a scrub over with a Houjix in hand. Barry draws about 15 cards and to his chagrin cannot find any starships except 1 but he only has 11 lifeforce left. He wasn’t much in the mood to play to begin with so he just extends his hand and tells me to “Take it down.”<br />
<br />
<b>Game 2 vs Andrew Moss’s QMC</b><br />
I heard Andrew’s name so I was fully anticipating a rematch from yesterday. Instead I get an even better matchup against QMC and he grumbles in disgust that I am playing the same deck. I missed my Daultay pull so I can’t move over first turn to put on super fast pressure. His turn he deploys Hark Seff at Bespin and draws a couple. Andrew started quick draw v so I have to be careful and not walk into some craziness with Leia’s gun. My turn I deploy another site and Dofine and move to Bespin with a support ship to back me up in case he drops HCF or something similar. He deploys Princess Leia and Luke SITF with saber, flips and consolidates. He moves Hark to Naboo. I play the Viceroy and a non-unique to the Throne Room. I deploy a unique and a non-unique to the Leia and Luke deploy -1 each! I battle and sniper luke so he is forced to path away. I grab. Grabbing this is better than Barrier in this matchup because it becomes expensive and sooner or later they won’t be able to escape all of my droids flooding their site but I wouldn’t make fun of you if you grabbed Barrier, just say you are stoopid. Andrew is already scrambling for an answer. He deploys Dash in ship, BoShek’s ship and someone else who isn’t BoShek and battles but I react and he is forced to lose scrub. He moves Hark over. I deploy Maul and ship, Guri in ship, Forced Servitude and now there is nothing he can do to stop me. I try battle leia with a lone DD but he is Barriered. He doesn’t have an answer for Maul and he didn’t get an ability 5 character with Keeping the empire out. He tries to do some damage and deploys Pucimir and some other aliens. I deploy 1 droid and battle and shoot everything up while draining for 5-6. He finally finds Boshek and deploys him but all hope is lost for the rebels. He battles and I lose Guri. I basically clean him out of Force and he finally gives in. He asks if he could have done anything else and I said no. When my guys deploy -1 each there isn’t much the opponent can do. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 3 vs Alex O’Sheas’ Communing Rogues</b><br />
After playing against Tacobill’s communing deck I felt a little better about this deck but this time I saw him start Declaration of Rebellion I knew it was going to be a lot of scrubs. This game took a while and had many turns so forgive me if I skipped something. My turn I do the usual: deploy a site, pull Dofine, pull the Viceroy. This turn I drew hoping for the Accelerate but I must have used it to deploy Dofine. He doesn’t do much and just deploys some activation. My turn I deploy activation and build my hand for the ensuing battle with hundreds of little people. He deploys Yoda GW and a Blind Jedi to the throne room. Okay not what I was expecting. I AM expecting Home 1 and Ackbar so I have to find Guri. I have her ship via Those rebels won’t escape us v but she seems to be eluding her and her fine self. I decide to eat a drain of 1 because it is only 1 and draw a couple more and save some because I don’t want to get a return beat in. He pays 3 to drain for 1 and I flip a guri. Wonderful. He doesn’t deploy any backup and just deploys home 1 to Tatooine and Fallen Jedi to his cantina. I have to have at least 3 droids to effectively fight Yoda since I started 3,720 to 1 instead of You cannot hide forever. I battle and miss the first shot on Yoda. Not happy about this I show my disgust to Alex. I, however, shoot Yoda the next time and his blind friend. If he draws a 4 I am golden but of course he draws a blind 6. So I lose to droids and wait for the worst with ghhhk in hand. He gets in a couple worth of drains and doesn’t really do much besides puts some passengers including shuttling Leia up on the home 1 and moves over to Naboo. Oh he drained me and I lost my 2nd Guri so that was cool. I deploy the Viceroy and Maul in ship to Tatooine and move the Flagship over. I can’t seem to find droids this game that easily to deal with Fallen Jedi. He deploys Tantive to Naboo and shuttles Leia aboard and moves Home 1 over. I retrieve with Firepower and he says I can’t. I show him his ability is blanked. I activate all but 1 and reveal a 2. I battle his Jedi and he can’t figure out why I did it. Eventually he reads all of my cards and realizes his immunity is -3. Time is abruptly called and it is pretty close but he has a big hand and can get a lot back by battling. He uses communing and other nonsense several times and puts a 1 on top of his reserve deck clearly wanting to battle me turn for what I think would be the game ending beat but unbeknownst to him I have an Elis in hand. He only deploys Han with Blaster to my site, drops First Strike and battles in space. That doesn’t do anything and before he has a chance to battle my lone droid I Elis away to Naboo. I play 3 used interrupts to seal my win. It was 16 to 21 or so. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 4 vs Angelo Consoli’s Imperial Entanglements</b><br />
I thought this game was only going to take about 20 minutes but somehow the full hour was needed to finish the game. Angelo gets a luck draw or to me seems like a lucky draw. He deploys the Admirals order and deploys Piett for 1 and another guy for 1. If not I think I would have tried to battle him at the system and try something but I just deploy 2 guys to the site and say go. He deploys a chicken walker and a couple of dudes to flip already and sits at two sites. I blow up the shields and deploy HCFv to Coruscant, tantive with a couple of guys on it to fight Devastator with a yub yub in hand and blow everything up. He only had 9 forfeit. I battle and he no response so I think I am rolling and just need to draw one 5 and win the game easily. The first is a 3 and the next is a 5! He immediately plays close call v. Okay fine, so I don’t win in 15 minutes I will just make it 30 minutes instead =) He drops down several imperials including Thrawn so I know I was going to be in a world of hurt. Luckily his draws were low and I didn’t lose much besides guys that were going to be redeployed next turn. He shuttles some guys down to get big damage in. I am draining for 5 and can’t find a Celebration or rogues. The story of the entire weekend. I deploy back to Tantive and another ship and draw. I get some goodies at least. He gets in around 8 damage and that hurt really bad. He thinks for almost 15 or 20 minutes contemplating on what to do. He even asks me and I go into Phil Laak mode. He finally decides not to do anything and moves some guys around. I battle on the ground so he has to react to stop the massive damage he is doing. It works. Well it he had to because he was going to take overflow. Now his damage is only 4 or so. He deploys some guys to Coruscant but time is called. I have around 15 to his 7 or 8. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 5 vs Ryan Freeman’s Communing Speeders</b><br />
I played Ryan last year and he didn’t know what to do against my droids. This game was no different. That is what I love about the droids, no one has ever play tested them except Aaron Nelson. My turn is pretty standard: pulling a site, Dofine, Viceroy. Since Ryan is playing speeders (He started flaps combo and gunrunner/with gun) I know I need to find my P-60 asap. Ryan pulls a site and thinks for a good while. This turn I thinks he just decides to draw but without playing A rebel leadership snagging the Home 1 War Room. My turn I just draw a bunch of cards and pulling a site. I know he is going to choke me so I just go ahead and deploy all of my sites. His turn he drops Wedge, RSL to the war room and tries to deploy Home 1 to Naboo but I inform him his icons are canceled and he promptly takes it back and thinks for a while. He finally ends up deploying Yoda, GW and Ackbar to the War Room and says go. My turn I deploy P-60 and 2 non-uniques to the Battle Plains to start trying to do some damage to him. I do NOT deploy to the throne Room because I can’t flip since I haven’t pieced together my space package yet. His turn he deploys Tatooine system and home 1 there. Good, I don’t have to worry about that crap now. He thinks for a good deal and finally decides to deploy Let’s Go Left and luke in Rogue 1 to my Courtyard. I guess he was contemplating on battling me at the Plains. If so, I would have used Oh Switch off on the shot on P-60 and would have killed Luke to attrition to go to the Used pile. I didn’t mind that because he hasn’t gotten out Echo Base Garrison yet and I would be draining and had another P-60 in hand just in case. Along with a sniper and would have blown up the maneuver-less speeder very easily. I don’t know if he had another but it would have been detrimental to him. He moves his Homey 1 over to Naboo. My turn I deploy Viceroy and droid to the Throne Room and two more droids to my battleship. I move the battleship over and shuttle the droids down to Obi’s hut. I am now threatening a drain of 8 if he doesn’t do anything to me. Meanwhile, time is down to about 10 minutes and I have only lost a couple of cards and I have Forced Servitude out. I deploy all of my retrieval defensive shields and coward and wait. He drains for 3 but I just ditch a droid. He then deploys two speeders with dash and hobbie and battle P-60. I shoot it and I have a droid sitting there. He moves luke over and tries to corner me. Yoda comes down to join the party. He moves Home 1 to Tatooine. I get droids back, deploy guri in ship and move stuff around. He goes deploys Flash and flips over a destiny and wants to take it back so he can drain. I cannot allow this and even asked three other players opinions and they all are in agreement with me. He says it would have been like 7 damage but he didn’t occupy the system so it would have been only 3. I had Tey How out to reduce the Naboo drain. Time is called and he tries what he can but cannot get me down anymore. I win 27 to 15 or so.  <br />

<b>Game 6 vs David Destefanis’ Spice</b><br />
He starts KDYv, I have you now v and endor shield. He groans and mumbles for a long time saying he can’t win. I know he will have some weird card choices in here so I have to be careful on what I do. He deploys Endor via KDY and pulls a site and draws a couple. I decide to deploy light which was probably a mistake and just drop a Keir Santage and Wedge RSL and draw the rest. I pull Obi in ship with Board and Field Dressing with DDTA. His turn he deploys another kessel site and deploys Vader with Saber, Ozzel and Veers to my site and battles. I play Yub Yub to add a battle destiny and he doesn’t grab to which surprises me. He moans. He swings and hits and I draw a 1 and a 3 so only Veers dies. What a waste of a yub yub. Santage gets stacked and Wedge receives the dressing. My last turn I drew into Hobbie V, which is money. I try to blow the shield and it is a success with a 4. I upload the JCC. I take Santage off and deploy him, hobbie and a veteran rogue and fight Vader and Ozzel. Shoot ozzel with ease and kill vader with attrition. I play too close for comfort to save a guy and just lose Hobbie so I can fight somewhere else with him. DDM moans some more. He deploys Victory and Thrawn to Kessel and chill there for the rest of the game. He was only draining of 1 so I didn’t care. I deploy Tantive and a Ten Numb to Coruscant and move 2 rogues over to drain for 5 next turn. He played Image on my site. He then deploys Blizzard 1, veers and the administrator to the Kessel site. I luckily drew into Leia V. I deploy her and Hobbie there to fight knowing he wouldn’t get a battle destiny. DDM moans even more to the extent he sounds like Chewie roaring. He plays Command and that upsets me as I will now have to lose a rogue and leave Leia all by herself without a Houjix in my hand. I have drawn it for destiny twice, which is annoying. I draw BD and it is 3 which will do some damage but he plays close call and will be immune again. Oh well. I move Leia over to the prison and draw hoping to find 1 of 2 of my escape pods or the Houjix. Nothing, I draw to 1. (HUGE mistake that I just realized typing this up) I should have saved 2 because David grabbed my Yub yub earlier and drew another 1. He spices and gets vader back. This is my second time playing spice and I wasn’t aware of the infinite manipulation possibilities that the DS player can do as well as the LS player. Vader came down to wedge and guy and he plays You are beaten and Wedge takes it for like 7 overflow. Oops. This is where I spaced and forgot about playing Yub Yub. I am not too worried still but time is getting close and I can’t find a Celebration. I deploy some rogues to his site and move Leia over. He lost a Maul with saber to the previous drains so he spices for it. I saved three to put it out of play but forgot. He deploys him and battles and does really nothing besides kill Leia. Time is called and I don’t think I can come back. For some reason I drew like 8 cards the turn before so I only have 11 in reserve to his 20 and like 5-6 in hand. I try for a beatdown on Vader with Luke, dash and another rogue. I cause 7 overflow but not enough. I had a rogue stacked but didn’t have enough force to get him back. As I was typing this up I realized I could have lost 1 from hand to put back several of my spice cards to used during his turn and play another rogue and that would have been like a 6-7 force swing and it would have been extremely close. Oh well. DDM rejoices. <br />
<br />
Hopefully Angelo didn’t pass me up on SOS. He didn’t, and I took down the Worlds Consolation Event for a 2nd time snagging $173 and a Blue Moon. <br />
<br />
So after SoCal, TMW and Worlds the destroyer droids are a surprising 13-2. I can’t complain against those results too much. 1 loss was due to a serious game play error on my part and the other was mentioned above.  <br />
