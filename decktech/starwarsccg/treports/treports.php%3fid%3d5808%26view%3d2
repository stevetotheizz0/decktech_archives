<br />
This tournament was the first one where our testing team would be nearly complete: me, Fabien Jacques, and Stéphane Flamme. Missing was only Tamas Papp from Hungary.<br />
The team is funny, because it has every kind of players ... the weird and original deckbuilder (me), the classical solid player (Stéphane), and the in-between &quot;open to everything&quot; player (Fabien). As for Tamas, he was not there, so we won&#39;t talk about him. :P<br />
<br />
We of course thought a lot about decks.<br />
For Dark Side we had a lot of options, and the last online tournaments, where I tried most of them, let me know what was working and what was not ... we could say that actually not much was working ... :P ... but on some platforms, the feeling was that there was no real hope, while in others, it was a question of some little tweaks or &quot;how to play the match-up&quot;.<br />
<br />
I was determined to play different decks than in Germany, and I had 4 to play. Dark was about HD(V) with troopers, or Galactic Domination with Dreadnaughts.<br />
LS was actually only HB(V) Speeders with weapons, but some days before the tournament, I found out, due to some talks with Tamas and testing vs. the HB(V) spies deck on Bothawui, a surprising beatdown platform with RST. So the deck was literally built 2 days before the tournament, with some also illegal combos that we would find out only the evening prior to the tournament (so we changed it a little bit to make it legal of course)<br />
Since Fabien wanted to play the HD(V) and the RST, I played the other 2 decks, HB(V) speeders (&quot;The Green Line&quot;) and Galactic Domination (&quot;Katana FLOPs&quot;).<br />
<br />
<br />
The turnout was a little bit low. 12 players only, half of what we had in Berlin.<br />
Some new players were there however, so it wasn&#39;t that bad. :)<br />
<br />
Game 1: The Green Line vs. Jimmy&#39;s Court<br />
Ah.<br />
Damned.<br />
It is my opinion that most speeders decks autolose to Court. Simply put, Court can hold down the AC and the system with ease, and thus drain for 3 a turn while ... you don&#39;t ... and keep the rest to mess with you.<br />
The game is then a race to painstakingly get out your space and clear the opponent there, while still holding your sites, so that you can retrieve with Celebration.<br />
Scum & Villainy makes it harder.<br />
My plan vs. Court is actually to set up near the AC, get out some Artillery Weapon and the Remote, and clear the site that way in my control phase while also clearing space.<br />
Point is, like I said, it&#39;s far from easy.<br />
Jimmy is playing a BH Court deck with Stockpile and Naboo Blaster Rifle (shoots at +2), using BD adders, Hidden Weapons, and even Trophy.<br />
I manage to check this turn 1 due to a misplay from his part (he checks for a immediate effect, but there is not, so I see all his deck).<br />
His first turn is him deploying the Barge and the passenger deck. He loses 1 to Court.<br />
I take out a site and a gun with Nick Of Time (V) (no Rapid Fire or Desperate Tactics, a clear sign I wasn&#39;t going to be lucky this game), drop a speeder, a gun, and Cmdr Wedge (V). Alas there was no Rieekan (V) either, which allows me to set up the Hoth War Room for more activation.<br />
His second turn shows him dropping 2 ships at the system, and a lone Xizor at the AC.<br />
ah well. .. what did I say about Court being able to put the pressure ? :-s<br />
When I check what&#39;s in my reserve with HB(V) turn 2, I see both Home 1 there, but no Ackbar. I drop Rieekan (V) but the Hoth War Room is in my force pile.<br />
I have 2 speeders, but he still fights. I manage to draw 2 BDs, but he still clear a speeder by hitting it and doesn&#39;t take overflow.<br />
The game continues like this, with me not managing to find any space (I drop Ackbar also to find the ship, but he hides in the force pile) ... I reinforce heavily on the 2/1 site, and get out the Artillery Remote combo.<br />
He doesn&#39;t battle and so I clear the AC next control phase, but I have no character to deploy there to cancel Scum, and no Houjix (so I can&#39;t move one there to do it either).<br />
He still comes down with Jodo and Dengar... Jodo autohits due to his text the speeder with Beezer and the Remote, while Dengar just miss his shots. But since Jodo is defense 6, I have problems hitting him too (and indeed I miss, with 3 shots while I autohit Dengar).<br />
In the end I draw crap for the 3 BDs, while he draws high, and since the Barge is there, he is also immune. He moves Jodo to the AC while he loses Dengar (and I lose the big speeder with Beezer .. and the speeder gets stacked on Trophy).<br />
I know I lost that game, so I just drop 2 guys to the AC, kill Jodo (forgetting I can&#39;t shoot with the weapons at the adjacent site into this battle), and cancel Scum... but I have then only one force left, so not enough to move back.<br />
He drops another Scum, an EPP alien, and Dr Evazan combo, so I lose all and 10.<br />
Soon after, time is called. I have some 11 cards left to his 25+ (with 2-3 cards in lost) so he takes the full win by the difference (it was ruled that way during the tournament).<br />
FL-15<br />
<br />
Highlights:<br />
- clearing the AC by hitting first Xizor then Mighty Jabba in a single turn with the Artillery Weapons<br />
<br />
Lowlights:<br />
- The 2 Home 1 hiding all the game (and my 2 NOOOOOOOOO!!!(V) too)<br />
- maybe I could have won this on time, considering the last 10 overflow ? Not really … I mean, it was still my 21 to his 24.<br />
- everything, actually ...<br />
<br />
As usual, I seem to always lose my first game in any tournament I play ...<br />
This is getting annoying but I couldn&#39;t do much that game.<br />
<br />
Game 2: Katana FLOPs vs. Jimmy’s Senate<br />
Weird enough, I&#39;m facing Jimmy again.<br />
He flips Senate with the usual stuff, and I&#39;m surprised ... who the hell play Senate nowadays, besides Chris Menzel ?<br />
I am not then particularly worried ... I mean, Chris plays Senate like a Machine, and I have a good experience on this.<br />
I know I can control the board and drains, and that I should be able to clear him from space (and he is not playing Squassin, so it&#39;s not a space version).<br />
The first turns are us setting up. I ignore his drains on senate with Come Here You Big Coward (I rarely ever played the shield in the last 5 years, it was the first tournament I did, and it was a good choice) while I finally drop the Exe, a TIE Squadron, and a Dreadnaught on Fondor (for 12 force).<br />
He drops EPP Obi on the 2/1 Kashyyyk site he pulled (the site where I activate none). I just cancel the drain the first time with I&#39;ll Take Them Myself, and then drop U-3PO there.<br />
I can&#39;t really drain too in space (he played Battle Plan) since he will just cancel it anyway.<br />
So I build some more my hand, and EPP 4-LOM(V) helps in this (but he&#39;s taking me away key cards with Senate in control phase) and I finally manage to hold 2 systems, while still having a fleet in my hand ready to come down on anything which will show its nose.<br />
Indeed, Home 1 with Ackbar (V) comes down. .. at the third empty BG system.<br />
I have only 1 card in lost since I retrieved 3 with Sienar the previous turn.<br />
My plan is to drop some TIE Squads, a Dreadnaught and R5-A2 and clear him with attrition (I have also Lateral Damage, just pulled).<br />
So I drop the first Squad, and Jimmy tells me I need to pay 3 to retrieve due to Aim High. I say I can let the retrieval gets cancelled but he doesn&#39;t agree. Judge is called, and some 10 minutes pass ... in the end, no real ruling is found, but Stéphane (the TD) agrees with Jimmy, so if I want to drop a Squad, I always need to pay 6 (3 to deploy, 3 to retrieve) if I have enough force to pay in Force Pile. (later on, on the PC boards, it was shown that the ruling was wrong: you can always decide not to pay)<br />
Of course, this changes wholly the game, because I can&#39;t drop 3 Squads and clear the sky.<br />
So I drop another Dreadnaught and move the Exe with a Dreadnaught and a TIE Squad in front of Home 1. I have Gravity Shadow in hand, and indeed, when he tries to move away, I play it, and he is stuck there ... He ponders a while, and draws just a couple.<br />
When I battle next turn, with Lateral Damage and some more ties and the droid, he loses everything + overflow, but he covers it with It Could Be Worse.<br />
I had seen that he had 2 ICBW in the deck, but I had grabbed Rebel Leadership (V) before, so I knew I needed to find the second grabber but it wasn&#39;t still in my hand.<br />
Still, I just spread to the 3 systems to drain freely now.<br />
I have nearly no hand, however, and I had also to recycle EPP Maul to get a tracked WMAOP (to get Lateral Damage) the turn before.<br />
Some turns later, Tawss Khaa (V) is on the site with Obi, and U-3PO dies with Sorry About The Mess.<br />
I can&#39;t cancel his drain there with Nizuc (V) anymore due to Tawss, and no EPP Maul means I can go there and clear Tawss Khaa (V) either. Not to mention that I would get killed with overflow due to Senate tricks if I would get down without a Ghhhk (and he grabbed Lightsaber Deficiency (V)).<br />
So we just trade drains: I pay 9 to drain for 9 while he pays 3 to drain for 3.<br />
The difference is that I can&#39;t cancel his drain, while he often cancels 2 of mine. Be it with Amidala + Senator on the drain canceller (I don&#39;t play the anti-senate shield) or with ICBW. Still, I have more Life Force than him, so as long as I can drain him for 3 a turn, I should win (as long as I can pay to drain).<br />
I can draw some cards each turn too, so sometimes I drop a TIE Squad for more retrieval, until I also find the grabber, so ICBW gets grabbed too, ending this annoying interrupt (albeit he would still play it a second time).<br />
When time is called, roles are reversed. I have slightly more than him.<br />
<br />
FW +5<br />
<br />
Highlights:<br />
- Senate being totally neutered by my deck<br />
- Blocking the H1 and clearing it with overflow. <br />
<br />
Lowlights:<br />
- the match-up is slow ... no drains get through for both until turn 5-6 at the earliest.<br />
- the wrong ruling on Sienar Fleet System retrieval which made it way more close than it really was. <br />
<br />
Game 3: The Green Line vs. Marc Théry&#39;s ISB Sunsdown (V)<br />
I know ISB very well ... considering the start of Marc, I don&#39;t think the deck stands much chance vs. a HB Speeders, since I will just clear him from sites with ease.<br />
We just draw turn 1, and turn 2, he targets Tatooine with Sunsdown (I play Professor (V)), and drops 4 agents at the 2/1 site, threatening a drain of 3 next turn there.<br />
I am a little bit surprised, so I just drop a speeder, Incom Corp, another speeder, a gun, a guy, and battle.<br />
I hit a ISB agent, and the 2 BDs I draw are however too low to clear another 2 guys, so he lost 2 guys while I lose ... a gun to Used.<br />
He drops another 2 agents and fights. I use Rapid Fire so that I can shoot again. Again, I lose only a gun to Used while he loses 2 guys.<br />
My next turn sees me clearing the site, unflipping ISB, while I have all my war rooms out.<br />
He draws, while I drop Home 1 and Ackbar (V) to Tatooine system, paying the full of it because I’m afraid of a barrier and Elis at the War Room, and I don’t want to play a lone Home One either since he’s playing KDY(V) and space.<br />
After a few turns, he has 2 Endor sites out, and occupies them both with a flipped ISB (drain of 3 each), and Endor system with a big ISD.<br />
I can&#39;t take a drain of 8 (as long as it was only one drain of 3 that I could cancel plus 2 force from Endor, it was ok), so while still retrieving everything with Celebration, I move Home 1 to Endor after dropping 2 speeders there (one is Dash In Rogue 10). The 2 speeders get down to an Endor site, so now, I will get hit only by 3, a drain that I can cancel.<br />
Marc fights again at the endor site, but Rapid Fire again hits the table and make him lose stuff while I lose a speeder and gun.<br />
He moves his 2 ISD to Tatooine, cancelling Celebration.<br />
I just reinforce at the Endor site with a pilot from Home 1, and move back Home 1. This time I have also the Heavy Turbolaser Battery.<br />
He however just fights some more at Endor, and stays.<br />
I try a sorry about the mess against a loaded ISD but I miss. I drop another Celebration and fights him, not before playing On Target on the loaded ISD, leaving only the Conquest (V) to draw for BD ... which is not possible since it&#39;s empty. He loses some pilots (I drew 3 BDs) while I miss again the ship.<br />
Since he can&#39;t move away, he just dies there next turn, while I win the game with no lost pile.<br />
<br />
FW +27<br />
<br />
Highlights:<br />
- unflipping ISB was cool. <br />
- owning the deck too, but it was really a bad match-up, and trying to go to Tatooine was bad too, from him.<br />
- owning space with On Target tech.<br />
<br />
Lowlights:<br />
- not managing to SATM or hit twice an ISD. But it had no impact anyway.<br />
<br />
Game 4: Katana FLOPs vs. Chris Menzel&#39;s Senate<br />
Again Senate ? <br />
Well, weird tournament ...<br />
I know Chris&#39; senate. He gets Home One and Ref III Falcon in space, while getting matching speeders on ground.<br />
I plan for the same strategy: set-up safely while controlling his drains, clearing him out of space, and then drain for the win.<br />
Chris tries indeed to set up on ground, on the Coruscant Landing Platform, and I U-3PO it.<br />
He soon follows with Corran and breaks his cover. I then plan a (very stupid) move: I decide to go down with EPP Maul there, since I have a Ghhhk, to kill Corran and U-3PO, so that I can retrieve the droid, and re-deploy it later without fearing Corran Horn anymore.<br />
Ah, right. Well, all goes down to the plan until I am actually there ... I battle, swing at Corran, hit, and then think about swinging at U-3PO but I look at Yoda (V) instead. I wonder if he has a Blaster Deflection ... but then realize that in a matching speeders deck, the odds are that he hasn&#39;t, of course. Considering the high destiny of Katana FLOPs, I then swing and hit Yoda.<br />
Considering attrition, even with the -3, he has to forfeit U-3PO and this is where I realize U-3PO won&#39;t go to my lost pile, but his ... what a moron I am ... I Ghhhk of course, but only Luke in Speeder is left.<br />
This makes him reinforce with another speeder the next turn (a mistake, imho, since with Senate, the speeder is immune <7, and he draws 2 BD if not able to otherwise).<br />
In Space, indeed, Obi in Ship, Home 1 and Ackbar (V) show themselves at an empty system. I have no Gravity Shadow in hand, but I know that both are in my Force Pile. So I bluff a little bit and move all ships in front of Home One ... which means 1 Dreadnaughts, 2 TIE Squads, and the Executor with Nizuc (V) and R5-A2. I leave however 6 in Force Pile, after drawing a Gravity Shadow. Enough to drop a TIE Squad as a react, even with Aim High.<br />
Chris sees the potential damage and clearing of space, and decides to move away ... first, to save himself a force, he carries Obi in Ship in Home 1.<br />
I smile internally.<br />
When he tries to move, Gravity Shadow hits him, and I draw a 3 this time (and not higher). In a dazzling flash of hyperespace fireworks, the Home One blows up in a thousand pieces, carrying with it the Mon Calamari admiral and poor Obi in ship inside.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s A Trap!&quot; I think silently. And the tactical genius Thrawn (V), in my hand, applauds the brilliant move I just made.<br />
I just spread then and start hitting Chris for 9 a turn (less when he has senators, but he seems to play less than usual).<br />
The Falcon shows itself, but too little too late and it&#39;s hard to battle and keep the upkeep.<br />
I start to brainfreeze (not fighting the falcon when he had no reserve) and draw a couple, but Chris stops me, shows me my mistakes, and a turn later, it&#39;s over.<br />
<br />
Highlights:<br />
- the Gravity Shadow move was splendid to see, and see the smilingly sad face of Chris, who just shook his head to this “yet another stupid French card” was great. I love surprising Chris. :)<br />
- this time I didn’t put SFS but late game, so I could clear the Home 1 even if it stayed.<br />
Lowlights:<br />
- let me remember myself the next time the meaning of “stolen”, for U-3PO …<br />
<br />
FW +22<br />
<br />
Game 5: The Green Line vs. Richard Andichon&#39;s Hoth CR(V)<br />
First of all, let me tell that I made a mistake in this game (honest one) that made the game less close than it looked. So sorry to Richard for this. I realized it only later in the evening.<br />
This is a match-up I never played. I know the deck, more or less. The concept is to have few walkers and then some heavy space. I know I can clear ground, but only if he deploys on a BG. Thankfully he does deploy quickly the 3rd marker to have more force.<br />
What happens is that Richard understands that coming to Tatooine with a walker isn&#39;t maybe the best of moves, and deploys a lone Boba in Ship to Kashyyyk first, turn 2 while I had already a presence on the 2/1 site (but he played Battle Order to prevent me from draining).<br />
I flip my 2nd turn, with 3 sites, and moving back all to the center site. So I can cancel his drain (so he is effectively draining for 1 there), so he doesn&#39;t drain either.<br />
Richard and me make both a mistake here ...<br />
He drops the Conquest (V) at another drain 2 system while I made him grab Rebel Artillery the turn before. He adds Arica to the Situation Room and I am puzzled. <br />
He was actually thinking it was only an interior site, so safe from speeders. Wrong.<br />
So I pile up power and clear him with Sandspeeders ... however, I forgot that he played Lightsaber Def (V) to grab Ghhhk (V) Turn one...<br />
Soon, he has also B2(V)+General Veers (V) at the 3rd marker, the AO is out, so he damages me for 2+2 in space (one is cancelled, so it&#39;s 3), 2 on ground, and direct damages for 1+1. So it&#39;s 7. But I am set up too with Home 1, Celebration, and Incom. So I retrieve 4 (Celebration for 3, and Incom for 1), and I drain for 5. It&#39;s more or less even, if we think it through, but I have a plan.<br />
He deploys indeed B1(V) to the 3rd marker, moves Veers to B1(V), and moves B2(V) to the 5th marker, to ping for 1 more.<br />
I play NOOOOO (V) in his draw phase to recycle a 5 (since I have a speeder, a gun, and Luke (V) in hand) and think about what to recycle under it. If I just want to hit and draw a BD destiny (even if I have a BD adder, I can&#39;t recycle 2 cards under NOOOOO(V)) then I can recycle Rapid Fire.<br />
But I realize (error on my part) that I can recycle the gun instead, activate all but 2, get the gun back with Nick On Time (V) leaving NOOOOO (V) in reserve, and fight and hit B1(V) with Veers, and then use SATM to make it immediately lost.<br />
So I do it, and indeed it works. Pity however that I realize afterwards that SATM can&#39;t make anything but &quot;characters&quot; lost. Neither me nor Richard understand this, so I think that if we both had, I would have recycled the 5, getting power 12 to his 9+2BDs. I would have probably forfeited Luke due to attrition however, and this would have changed the game.<br />
So right now, Richard has not anymore Battle Order satisfied. He still pays 9 to drain for 5, and pings for 1... but he realizes that I retrieve now 5 (courtesy of Luke) and drains for more...<br />
So he drops General Veers (again) after thinking a lot, in B2(V), and moves him in front of Luke (V).<br />
There, since I have the 5 tracked, I just SATM again (yes, I play 2) in the control phase and make him lost.<br />
The game just snowball from there, and he draws up.<br />
<br />
Note: there was no question I would have won that game, once set-up. The move of Luke and shooting was wrong, but I could have played it differently (even with a 2nd speeder). Still, playing the card wrong is not a good feeling.<br />
<br />
Highlights:<br />
- besides the wrong SATM move and Ghhhk one, I think I played near to perfection. Ok, still some room for improvement, but I really managed to hold down a good battle plan to win the game.<br />
- hitting (this time legally) B2(V) with SATM was great too, and added a 2nd drain of 2 there.<br />
<br />
Lowlights:<br />
- well … the illegal SATM move.<br />
<br />
FW +12<br />
<br />
Game 6: Katana FLOPs vs. Richard Andichon&#39;s Profit.<br />
Again a rematch.<br />
Profit vs. Gal Dom. isn&#39;t really in DS&#39;s favor, imho. But I play some EPPs, Imperial Decree (V), and drain control.<br />
It will all boil down to what Richard will do, and how fast I can set up and find my key cards.<br />
He asks me if I want to deploy some aliens in the AC and I actually think this through for a while ... hello ? the only alien in the deck is Nizuc (V)!<br />
Maybe this helped me, however, since my hesitation made maybe think Richard about the amount of ground I had in the deck.<br />
I have not perfect recollection of that game buuuttt ... I remember he flipped turn 2, and I proceeded to cancel always his drains at the AC. He paid for it like if Battle Plan / Order was on table but ... I didn&#39;t play it (I wanted him to play it, to save shield slots) but I didn&#39;t realize him paying (or let&#39;s say, it seemed normal to me that he paid). My next turn i PAID to drain too (applause!!!) for 3. On turn 3 he added IL-9 (V) with Leia on the Meditation chamber. So I got Thrawn (V) with Imperial Command (he grabbed), and deployed him to the Executor and moved the ship to Tatooine, while drawing cards. EPP 4-LOM(V) was giving me hand manipulation, and since I knew what was in his hand (Thrawn (V) rules) I was in pretty good shape.<br />
Both drains were taken care of with Nizuc (V) and (a looping) Tarkin&#39;s Orders.<br />
He tried to deploy in space, but Home One and Ackbar (V) were killed with overflow the next turn with Lateral Damage.<br />
He then understood he was going to lose, so went into speed mode and put out Amidala (due to a lucky Let The Wookie Win (V)), all 4 mains at 3 different BGs (Meditation chamber was still one).<br />
He never deployed Battle Plan because he wasn&#39;t playing it. I never deployed it because I like draining for 9 for free, while he was direct damaging for 6, so paying would have screwed me more, I guess. In the end, I never found out EPP Maul and even thought I was cancelling always at least 2 drains a turn, we were still damaging ourselves for the same amount (that is, 9). My retrieval helped me, with Thrawn and SFS, to come out on top, however.<br />
<br />
FW +10<br />
<br />
Highlights:<br />
- managing to win vs. Profit. The game can go either way, but winning it and being 5-1 is good.<br />
- cancelling drains over and over with Tarkin’s Orders and Nizuc (V) was great.<br />
Lowlights:<br />
- having to recycle EPP Maul made it closer than it was alas. I mean, I was seeing his hand everytime, so I could have dropped EPP Maul without fear of a counterbeat due to Barrier.<br />
- playing both anti-SAC shields … while he wasn’t playing any … but I couldn’t know.<br />
<br />
So I am the only 5-1 player, and the other finalist is none other than Angelo, who is playing QMC (hard match-up) and HD(V) (easy match-up I think especially since I play Cmdr Wedge (V)).<br />
We decide not to play it, since it would last ages.<br />
So I get the title, we split our prizes as we like best, and call it a deal … while promising ourselves to play a “final” sooner or later … ah well … it would happen sooner than I thought: the next day, actually. :)<br />
