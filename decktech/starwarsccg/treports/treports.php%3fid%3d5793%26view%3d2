We had 10 people, which is actually the most we&#39;ve had at a local - awesome!  Everyone loves the Cube.  We used my cube (hosted here: http://www.atlantaswg.com/images/cubebythrodo.xls) and Kevin Reitzel&#39;s.  He is going to email me his cube xls file and I&#39;m going to host it online soon too.  Each person drafted both light and dark.  I drafted from my cube.  Most people thought Kevin&#39;s was a bit more powerful, as he had some extra starting interrupts (12 card hand and CR/CP v) and also pre-ban Rebel Fleet V.  After this he is going to change the Rebel Fleet V to the same text as Imp Domination v because it did end up being very strong in the cube.  <br />
<br />
DA DRAFT<br />
<br />
Basically for both of my decks I just tried to get balanced cards for space and ground.  Any characters that drew bd on their own were great.  Also pilots affected by iao/insurrection, etc.  For light I was able to draft 3 mon cals (excellent cards in the cube) and 2 corvettes (also good).  So I was set for space.  And on ground I had LS Mara, Fallen Jedi, Corran, Chewie Protector, etc.  So good stuff everywhere.  And I drafted both the nabrun and elis (only one of each in my cube and kevin doesn&#39;t use them in his cube so I was the only one who had them all day).  For dark I had a much harder draft than light.  I couldn&#39;t find hardly any good characters or ships.  Actually, when we had drafted 3 packs, I looked and saw I only had 6 characters and 2 ships (an icsd and a tie scout).  That is horrible!!  With only 18 cards left to draft, I needed to get a lot more ability cards.  I had a little better luck in those last 2 packs, ending up with 15 characters (a good amount, but not very good quality ones overall).  I only was able to get 1 more tie scout (ugh) and 1 Dominator (v) though.  So my space sucked.  I guess someone around me was taking all the characters early on and all the ships the whole time.  I&#39;ve never had that hard of a time drafting good characters and ships before.  <br />
<br />
BUILDING CUBE DECKS<br />
<br />
Building Cube decks is easy.  I will teach you all the best method!  See, you build 45 card decks and you draft 45 cards.  Then you throw in the 12 fixed locations.  So you only have to take out 12 cards, and most of the fixed locations normally suck so you will end up removing most of them.  Here&#39;s how it went for me with my balanced decks.  In both of my decks I drafted 3 twixes (yes I got lucky with that) and a 2/2 space and ground site.  So I definitely wanted to play those 5 locations.  Well normally 5-6 locations is best, but with 3 twixes and 2 2/2s, I bumped it up to 7 locations since its also good to play a 2/1 drain -1 site and system.  If you were playing a ground or space focused deck and not a mixed deck, then you wouldn&#39;t need either the space or ground one.  Those 2/1 drain -1 locations are what you will normally pull with your once per game dl a bg rule.  <br />
<br />
So basically I figured out that it was best to only play 2 of the 12 fixed locations, so I removed the other 10.  Then I just went through all the cards I had leftover and picked out the 2 most useless ones.  It took easily less than 10 minutes for both decks.  <br />
<br />
Normally you will end up using more of the fixed locations and not drafting so many twixes, but then you will just as often want to use only 6 locations, so you will still only have to take out 2-3 cards that you drafted from your decks.  This goes to show that literally 14 out of every 15 cards you draft in a cube event will end up in your deck.  So there is little room for error in the draft part of a cube tournament.  Its much harder to draft correctly than it is to build your draft deck.<br />
<br />
4 GAMES<br />
<br />
Game 1 vrs Tommy&#39;s dark deck<br />
I drafted Y4:TR so I started that every game and tried to mulligan whenever I didn&#39;t have another 2/0 in my starting hand.  So this game my first turn I played a 2/0 and pulled a 2/1 drain -1 for my once per game bg.  Then I drew my 3 (he started a 2/1 site - mos espa) and got another twix or 2/1 drain -1 or something.  So my early game force gen was rocking.  I also drew Mara, a corvette, and corran in my starting hand, and got phylo, another corvette, and fallen jedi within the first 3-4 turns.  Basically this game was pretty easy because of how lucky I got with my draws.  I also had some 2/2 rebels and Nabrun in hand.  I played We&#39;re Leaving (houjix effect) and spread on ground with phylo at his dbay, mara at mos espa - drain of 2 there since she&#39;s a smuggler, fallen jedi at another drain 1 site, a 2/2 rebel at a 4th site.  Then I had a corvette with corran h piloting at tatooine.  He played Mighty Jabba in front of my 2/2 rebel and Prince Xizor in front of Phylo, so I nabruned the 2/2 rebel to help out phylo and kill xizor.  Basically he just couldn&#39;t keep up with my quick start and I eventually got another ship over to Sullust for another drain of 2.  He did slow my drains on ground but couldn&#39;t drain much himself so that was it.  FW by 17 or something similar.<br />
<br />
Game 2 vrs Jeremy&#39;s light deck<br />
Jeremy beat me by 27 last tournament so I wanted revenge!  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think this game counts.  His light deck had so many crazy things going on.  It was all aliens.  He had Yerka Mig + Cantina, A Remote PLanet + ep1 tatooine sites, pucumir + kebyc + some cc sites.  He told me after the game that he made one big mistake drafting.  He was going for aliens from the start but kinda got screwed when Baragwin (v) and Yerka Mig (v) were in the same pack.  He made the wrong choice going for Yerka.  Choosing Baragwin would have let him just play on CC with Pucumir or Tatooine ep1 sites with Remote Planet.  He had a quick start this game though, but I took over the Cantina before he got there which made his Yerka Mig useless.  I played Vader (v) + Brangus + Sim Aloo to the cantina to hold it all game.  Then he went to space (light Kashyyyk) with Pulsar Skate + 2 RFCs, who made the skate maneuver 6.  I attacked him with Dominator V + Thrawn + 2 forfeit 3 cards.  I swear I didn&#39;t know he had darklighter spin!  But he did have it and played it so I was left with only dominator and thrawn.  I was actually very worried he would be able to clear that off soon since my deck&#39;s space package sucked and I had no backup in hand for it, but he wasn&#39;t able to all game.  I cleared his system though in that battle because I was able to track a 6 destiny early on in the game and draw it as one of my 2 bds (the other was a 1, but it was enough!).  Then he played 2 Tatooine ep1 sites where I could drain for 2 and didn&#39;t put any characters there, so I took them over.  Oh, all this time he had a huge alien force on Cloud City with Pucumir and Kebyc v and Melas v and Yoxgit and stuff, so he was draining for 3 there total and I couldn&#39;t touch it.  After I cleared him out of space though, it seemed he had over deployed majorly at CC so he was real low on cards and I took the win.  Another FW by 17 or something similar.<br />
<br />
Game 3 vrs Mike Kessling&#39;s dark deck<br />
Mike is an old school ATL player who recently came back to the game.  His first tournament back was our last cube which he won.  We were both undefeated at this point also.  This game was really close.  I started the throne room again and luckily drew my y4: Jedi Academy early because he went to the throne room with a spy asap and made me deploy 5 characters there.  2 died in battles, leaving me with only chewbacca protector, corran h, and I think Fallen Jedi.  He thought he&#39;d stranded them there... but no!  I had my y4 drain 2 site to move them to.  I also went early to Sullust with Dash (v) + Outrider and a 2/2 rebel forfeit fodder.  And then I made a dumb mistake.  Mike was spreading on ground because he couldn&#39;t touch my space or the 2/2 y4 site (guess he didn&#39;t have much dark space either?) and I had nabrun in hand.  So I&#39;ve got something like power 15 at the 2/2 y4 site setup for a nabrun beat, and I stupidly play my own insurrection just to give the 2/2 rebel in space forfeit 6 instead of 4.  I was worried he would kick me out of space, but forgot about the anti-nabrun text and screwed myself.  He was at 4 drain 1 sites, and I had the 2 drain 2s, but I was ahead from draining in space early in the game.  Then I drew the blowout card - Battle Plan!  And I had gotten a couple mon cals in my hand by this turn too, so I knew I&#39;d be able to take whatever space he tried to put up there.  He played an icsd + tarkin in an attempt to try to drain for free, which I cleared with both mon cals.  I was able to clear him off the ground eventually too before the end of the game.  FW by 14 I think?<br />
<br />
Game 4 vrs Mike Kessling&#39;s light deck<br />
So if I win, I win the event.  If Mike wins by 24, he wins the event.  If Graham wins and I lose, Graham wins.  This game was really tough for me though.  I always felt like I just wasn&#39;t drawing useful cards.  I think the main mistake I played early on was playing a 2/2 site.  I thought I could hold it, since all I had in my hand was ground stuff, but I really couldn&#39;t.  We battled there some (2/2 cc site), but at the same time Mike was able to go to my 2/0 executor site with a spy + backup and cause some extra force loss.  I did take that out with Prince Xizor + Vader&#39;s Cape.  Then I made my 2nd mistake, elising Xizor over to help Vader (v) at the cc site.  Vader&#39;s help had been cleared out and I had forgotten that Xizor is quite vulnerable to weapons (even with a pretty cape) and Mike had a Republic Trooper with epp Rifle silliness.  So I elised Xizor there just to have him be shot up dead.  I think if I hadn&#39;t done that tough, Vader would have died, but I could have just run vader away.  Instead of helping Vader, Xizor could have gone to Mike&#39;s 2/0 endor site to drain for 2 all game.  After that it was just downhill.  I was tracking around a 5 and a 6 destiny for a long time but even with abusing that as much as possible, it didn&#39;t make much of a difference since Mike was tracking a 5 at the same time.  I tried going to space with GAT + dominator v + a forfeit 4 non-pilot (all I had in hand).  My 2 bds were a tracked 6 and a random 1, which would have cleared his system unless he hadn&#39;t reacted w/ the spiral, and then it just killed the spiral :(  So he was left with big power + a bd there, and his bd was high so I had to lose thrawn and not have a bd.  He battled the next turn and I lost 8 and basically the game.  FL by 14 or something.  <br />
<br />
I ended up coming in 2nd, the 1st loser.  There&#39;s no prizes for losers!!!  Graham won his first tournament - awesome job btw!!  Its about time he won one of these.  He wins $50 worth of swccg cards from some online store ($5 per each player we had there).  Even though I didn&#39;t win the event, I was really pleased with how I played even with the little mistakes in the last game.  I tracked really well all event, never missing a draw and often tracking multiple destinies.  I think its easier to track in the Cube as opposed to normal constructed since you aren&#39;t searching your deck as often.<br />
