Now after studying various designs, I have made one of my own (using Brian Fred’s as a mold).  I decided to write this article first to share my crazy ideas and combos before posting the deck.  It is a tad lengthy, but I am trying to be as thorough as possible.  A lot of time has gone into this; please don’t review until you’ve seen the entire article.  Thanks a lot!<br />
<br />
<br />
First, some history.<br />
<br />
Decipher has gone on record as saying that the last four sets it produced before losing the license to Star Wars were not of as high a quality as they would have liked them to be.  They were rushed and pressured to finish the Episode I cards before they lost the license to continue making any SWCCG cards.  As a result, many cards that came out from Tatooine-Theed Palace were either ridiculously overpowered or just plain horrible.  The two objectives released in Theed Palace were deemed horrible and were never seen placing at major events.  It looked like WHAP would have to forever sit in card binders and serve only as eye candy.<br />
<br />
Then came the v cards.  With the release of vset 5 and the help of Scott Lingrell, new life was given to WHAP.  With Secure Route (v) as its saving grace, WHAP even managed to place 2nd at Worlds under the direction of Brian Fred.  Things were looking up for WHAP.<br />
Then came vset 6.  WHAP fans around the world groaned as they read Imperial Decree (v).  WHAP began to fall out of public favor, and although it did pop up at events now and then, it almost certainly was never chosen over the new v6 powerhouses for light side like QMC, Hidden Base, crazy Profit, or even TRM (yeah EBO).  Surely this was the end of WHAP.  Or was it?  This article will attempt to analyze WHAP to determine if it is still playable and competitive in a post v6 SWCCG environment.<br />
<br />
OK, so we all know what we’re dealing with, here’s the text of the objective.<br />
<br />
We Have A Plan:  Deploy Theed Palace Throne Room, Theed Palace Hallway, and Theed Palace Courtyard.  For remainder of game, you may not deploy cards with ability except (ep. 1) Jedi, aliens, (ep. 1) vehicles, Republic characters, and (Republic) starships.  Your Destiny is suspended.  You lose no force to Vengeance Of The Dark Prince.  While this side up, you may not deploy characters to interior Naboo sites.  Once per turn, may activate 1 Force.  Flip this card if you control Theed Palace Throne Room (with Amidala there).<br />
They Will Be Lost And Confused:  While this side up, you lose no more than 2 Force to any Force Drain.  Your (Rep.) starships are power +2 and immunity to attrition of (Trade Federation) starships is cancelled.  If opponent just drew a battle destiny greater than three, you may use 1 Force to cancel that battle destiny.  During your control phase, opponent loses 2 Force for each battleground site you control with Amidala or Panaka.  Flip this card if opponent controls Theed Palace Throne Room.<br />
<br />
So there we go.  Next I’ll divide the article into two sections- strengths and weaknesses.<br />
<br />
STRENGTHS<br />
<br />
Obviously this objective would go nowhere without Secure Route (v).  This fantastic effect not only lets you deploy to the Throne Room right away (making a first turn flip very possible), but also lets you have an almost infinite card hand!  See something you want in your lost pile?  Just deploy a Republic character and get it back.  It’s a shame that there can’t be an infinite loop with characters with Route (v), but more on that later.  Let’s not forget the built in Ultimatum either.  This can give you a big edge against decks based on draining like deal and decks like CCT that often try for one really large drain.  Direct damage is obviously another huge strength for light side.  When you really sit down and think about it, how many light side decks can you think of that do well with direct damage?  Profit maybe, LS senate maybe, TIGIH maybe.  MBO of course and RST can do it although the latter is almost NEVER seen anymore.  Speeders are a good choice, but decree (v) can really shut it down.  Speeders don’t have the options to be as flexible as WHAP, but we’ll get to that later.  Asteroids?  Not likely.  So what you have is an objective that can flip quite quickly, and start the damage rolling almost instantaneously.  Now if only it had some help with battling.  But what’s that?  It does!  How many times do you have your opponent draw a battle destiny greater than 3?  Tracking is all the rage, everyone knows that.  And there’s no limit to how many times a turn you can do it, as long as you have enough force.  Fett on crack and Vader aren’t nearly as dangerous now as they would be against any other LS deck.  Oh, and let’s not forget that the objective comes out and almost kills two entire dark decks:  Black Sun and Bring Him Before Me.  Not that these two decks are that popular nowadays, but hey, every little bit helps.  Activation is also rarely an issue with this deck as many characters deploy for dirt to Naboo, and you can activate a force EVERY turn.  Surprise your opponent by grabbing one of his Used Interrupts on his first turn!  To my knowledge TRM is the only other deck that can do that, unless if you’re playing Blue Milk or something silly like that.  Anyway, I digress.<br />
<br />
WEAKNESSES<br />
<br />
Of course to be fair I have to address these as well.  Thankfully, the most glaring problem with the objective is solved by Secure Route (v).  Having to deploy to the courtyard, then move to the hallway, then to the throne room is just silly…even with the all-powerful Ascension Guns!  (he said sarcastically)  Many people may look at the character selection as a weakness, and that may be so.  You won’t see any Lukes or Leias in this deck, but I believe that with a little creativity one can find that this isn’t a very serious weakness at all.<br />
NO SPACE<br />
Yeah, I admit the possibilities of going to space are pretty limited with this deck.  Granted, the Bravo fighters are awesome when they’re all together and doing their thing…but they just don’t tend to work in most circumstances.  Too many card slots are required to fit them all in, and a good dark space deck wouldn’t have trouble at all getting rid of Ric Olie and his crew.  The Executor with Guri aboard, or maybe some Admirals would rip through them before they knew what hit them.  Dash is a possibility, but again you’re looking at a lot of card slots if you really want to have a good space package, and that sacrifices your potential on the ground.  WHAP is definitely meant to prosper on the ground.  This calls for creativity too, and I will address this weakness in the next section of the article.<br />
SAC<br />
Not quite as deadly, but still a definite threat if you play an intelligent opponent who wants to Alter your precious Secure Route (v).  I’d start with the Wise Advice shield out almost every game to prepare for this, maybe even Do, Or Do Not.  And of course you’re packing plenty of Controls too just in case.  Definitely use Wise Advice, if that effect hits your lost pile, you’re in a world of hurt.<br />
FIRST TURN PALPY<br />
This one definitely deserves its own section.  Dark side players are notorious for putting out first turn Palpys, largely because they think they’re invincible.  It really is a shame Down with the Emperor (v) got changed, but oh well.  This is indeed a tricky problem to overcome.  In many instances, it’s probably wise to let him sit there a turn while you prepare an assault.  Try and bait the Force Lightning so that he loses his immunity, then just attack with anyone who can draw destiny.  This is definitely a serious problem, but certainly not insurmountable.  Patience is the key, if you attack too early, you’re likely to accomplish nothing.  But as long as you keep presence at the Throne Room after that you don’t need to worry about him coming back.<br />
DECREE (V)<br />
OK, the one you’ve been waiting for.  It really is a shame that when the PC gave us the dark side version of Honor they didn’t give us the light side version of No Escape.  I imagine it’ll come in a future vset, but for now, WHAP will have to confront Decree (v) alone.  This effect can almost single-handedly shut down a WHAP deck.  Great efforts must be taken in order to get around this card.  Without nice direct damage, WHAP is basically reduced to a battling mains deck with a bit of draining thrown in.  Now it’s time to put your creativity to the test.  Let’s see if we can solve these problems.<br />
<br />
SOLUTIONS TO WEAKNESSES AND OTHER NIFTY TRICKS<br />
<br />
Let’s tackle the space problem first.  Obviously, if you’re going up against SYC Fear, or some other big blue type of deck, you’re going to have your mettle tested.  One obvious suggestion is I Hope She’s All Right.  This adds to your direct damage and is definitely to be considered, just watch out for SYC.  They have NO trouble satisfying the requirements for this effect and they take no battle damage at their docking bay.  Don’t spread yourself too thin without a Houjix or some evasion.  Against a big blue deck, it’s essential to minimize damage as much as possible.  Alter their Fear, Atrocity (v) their damage and drains, etc.  Use Route (v) to get cards back from your lost pile as well as Flash of Insight (v).  Don’t underestimate It Could Be Worse either, but obviously never do it unless you feel safe from its dreaded killer.  The Light Side has a ton of ways to minimize damage that is dealt against it, you’ll need them for this type of matchup.  Thankfully your Obj has a built in Ultimatum to use against the likes of Chiraneau, Presence of the Force, and other dark side tricks to increase drains.  If you can use your mains to keep them off of battleground sites, I Hope She’s All Right will be a lifesaver here.  Other nifty damage tricks will help too, which I’ll talk about later.<br />
The SAC problem is definitely the easiest problem to solve.  Like I said before, simple controls will help a great deal, and as long as you play with Wise Advice, Secure Route (v) should never be out of reach.  I hesistate to play Do, Or Do Not because with all of the Jedi I’d like to run my own SAC package here.  This problem shouldn’t hinder you that much.<br />
OK, now the big one.  Until the light side gets their No Escape, it will have to live with Decree (v).  In essence, you can expect your objective damage to rarely be over one, but let’s think about this for a minute.  You definitely have the option to send your mains to knock them off of battlegrounds, although this may not be always easy.  Make sure to have some trick up your sleeve if you get Barriered or something.  My solution to this problem is to cause lots of little damage.  Eventually it will all add up.  Here are a few ideas for getting through Decree (v)<br />
<br />
Mace damage- get Mace at the council chamber when Ami’s out.  This will cause another damage of 1 a turn.  Be sure to be ready to go for Maul, OOC Phantom Menace if necessary, then get OOC back to put Maul OOP.<br />
Rebel Artillery-It’s a 7, and it’s fun!  It’s easy to put Amidala’s gun and Panaka’s gun in here, so why not take advantage of them?  WHAP plays with SO many interrupts, they can’t possibly grab them all.  If they don’t grab Artillery, that’s a lot of damage you can cause if you’re good at tracking.<br />
Horace Vancil+Leesub Sirln-this one’s a bit more odd, but bear with me.  Use Horace first to reveal a random card from your opponent’s hand.  They put it in used or lose a force.  If it’s a really good card, they’ll of course lose the force (at least the first time, haha).  Here’s the trick…keep your eye on that card.  Leesub doesn’t say pick a card at random.  She says pick a card.  Point at the card that was just revealed to you.  Then think really hard and guess what type of card it is.  It’s lost anyway!  That’s two additional damage in your control phase!  Of course they may just put it in their used pile, but you can still guess with Leesub and worst case scenario, you’ll know a card in your opponent’s hand.  That’s never a bad thing.<br />
I Hope She’s All Right-already been discussed and probably the most difficult to pull off.  If you can do it tho, this little damage can be huge.<br />
Drains-duh.  Play the lightsabers that add to drains.  Also, I’d pack Lightsaber Proficiency to add even more.<br />
So let’s assume that Decree (v) is out and running full force.  It is still not impossible at all to hit your opponent up for maybe 8 damage.  (say one from Leesub, 2 from one drain, maybe 2 from another, plus Artillery, plus Mace, plus your objective).  Remember that’s an average guess, could be easily more, or easily less.  That’s huge with all of your other damage minimization going on!  If Decree isn’t out, I shudder to think about how much damage that could be.  ICBW and Atrocity (v) and Flash (v) and Route(v) will help you to keep getting cards back from your lost pile or will help to keep you from losing too much.<br />
This by no means kills Decree (v), but I think it’s manageable.  <br />
<br />
All right here are some cool tricks that may or may not work, but lemme know what you think.  I certainly do not claim any or all of them to be my own.<br />
<br />
Wokling (v)-Yeah, this has been around for a while, but I guess I should mention it anyway.  Typically you use your first 3 force of the game to pull Secure Route (v) with Wokling (v).  Plus you get even more activation and a little desperate retrieval.<br />
Goo Nee Tay+Naboo Celebration:  OK, Lord Vader wants to rush me, he’ll be 12 force.  Maul w/stick?  He’ll cost you 11.  It’s pretty hard to pull off, but there’s no harm in keeping your throne room safe.<br />
Any annoying interrupt+Secure Route (v)-I hinted at this before, and it is by no means a new idea.  It’s a Trap!  is a good one to abuse, as is Control and Tunnel Vision.  There is just simply NO way your opponent will grab all of your interrupts.  And almost all of them can be abusive.  Who doesn’t love infinite loops with OOC/TT?  Have fun with which ever ones don’t get grabbed.<br />
Jerus Jannick-duh, he’s just awesome in this deck.  Make sure to run K’lor’slug (v) tho, as a quick choking from DVDLOTS will absolutely ruin your day.  Oh, make sure to use Disorder (v) to get him right back when he dies.  Which brings me to:<br />
Civil Disorder (v)-I think I’ve saved the best for last.  This card is HUGE in WHAP.  And not just because it drastically hurts combat, which was definitely a tricky matchup before.  Thanks to Route (v) and Disorder (v) there is NO card in your lost pile you can’t get to.  The infinite loops get even sillier when you battle to get a character back, then deploy him or her to get another card back.  Disorder (v) and WHAP were made for each other.<br />
<br />
Congrats on getting this far, you’re almost done!  I’m going to list a few matchups here, but most will be with my deck when I post it.<br />
<br />
Walkers-While building a WHAP deck, I constantly thought of how it could counter walkers, I knew it wasn’t going to be easy.  Walkers is so popular right now tho that it would be foolish to build a deck without considering it at all.  Here’s my thinking:<br />
<br />
First action- get out the DDTA shield.  Pull Heroic Sacrifice (v).  I know that most walker decks love to abuse Blizzard 4 to pull Vader to blow the poor defenseless shield generators.  This will punish them, at least a little bit.  Plus, it reduces Blizzard 4’s power and gets rid of its ability to draw battle destiny.  It’s possible to attack now, but still I would never ever ever recommend it unless you’re ready for Ice Storm, Trample, or whatever.  Pack a Houjix before ever visiting Hoth.  OK, again damage minimization is the name of the game.  Flash (v) is a great friend in this matchup.  Atrocity (v) the damage from blowing the generators, and atrocity the direct damage after that, as well as whatever drains you can.  You can use T-47 Battle Formation to get rid of Garrison, but Sense works as well.  Don’t rely on the sense, as Controls are all too common.  Hopefully Leesub or Horace will help you get a key card out of their hand, this will be a tough matchup.<br />
<br />
Here’s another idea I had.  This would certainly be a lot of fun, and I think it just might work.  Pack a whole bunch of Imperial Atrocities, I’ll say six for now.  Make 4 of them v and 2 regular.  Use the v ones as much as possible to reduce as much damage as you can as fast as you can.  Oh, and above all DO NOT FLIP.  You heard me, keep Amidala out of the throne room.  If you flip you ruin the whole strategy.  Then, once you have the 4 virtual atrocities out, wait for Garrison.  When Garrison comes, BAM!  Play the non-v Atrocity and they lose 10.  If they do it again they lose 12.  I’m not sure if this would really work or not, but it sure would be fun.  Worst-case scenario you’d have a bunch of sixes in your deck.  If this works for anyone, let me know, I’ll try it if walkers get to be huge around my area.<br />
<br />
CCT:  Another reason I wanted to make WHAP was because I was sick of losing my Han.  It’s really annoying to have to battle out on Cloud City to free the popsicle.  With WHAP, I have no problem with Han chilling in the Security Tower.  They can keep Lando too.  You can Atrocity (v) their drain at the tower, and you should have little trouble getting set up on Naboo.  Feel free to harass them on CC, but don’t get too crazy.  As always there just isn’t anything you can do about their space, but you can stop Occupation by knocking them off of battlegrounds.  Keep the damage up and you should do well.  They should be hard-pressed do really get Decree (v) rolling unless they play a lot of space.  This is definitely winnable.<br />
<br />
So while WHAP definitely does have its weaknesses, I do not by any means think these weaknesses are insurmountable.  I think WHAP can definitely be tourney worthy, and who knows, it may be able to win consistently.  I personally think this deck would be a blast to play though, and I’d definitely like to hear any other stories you guys may have about WHAP, especially if they’re post v-set 6.<br />
<br />
Well that’s about it I guess…look for more matchups and stuff when I post the deck shortly.  Thanks a whole bunch for reading!!<br />
