Dan has been with the company for a long time, and if there&#39;s ever any tournament information you needed to know, Dan&#39;s the guy to go to.  In addition to being closely involved in Star Wars, Star Trek and Lord Of The Rings CCGs, Dan has just got off the Black Rider tour.  Since there&#39;s few people around more closely tied to Decipher&#39;s activities, I asked Dan about the past, present and future of Decipher&#39;s CCG ventures, as well as his opinion of the Player&#39;s Committee.<br />
<br />
JT: What do your duties at Decipher entail?<br />
DB: Well, I have a couple of official titles:  &quot;Marketing Coordinator, Organized Play&quot; and &quot;Director of the DGMA&quot;  The things that I&#39;m responsible for are:  Tournaments, Leagues, Online TCGs.  My day-to-day work schedule is diverse.  Some days I am working exclusively on things like prize support or email.  Other days I work on big-picture things like budgeting, new tournament programs, proposals, convention schedule planning, etc.   <br />
<br />
JT: How long have you been with the company?<br />
DB: Here&#39;s the breakdown by involvement (my path to employment):<br />
<br />
Player (started with SW:CCG): 7 years<br />
TD: 6 years<br />
Product Champion: 4 years<br />
Playtester: 3 years<br />
Decipher Intern: 1 year<br />
Decipher Employee: 2 years<br />
<br />
<br />
JT: I imagine you get to travel a lot as a result of your position.  What is your most memorable trip?<br />
DB: Two trips come to mind immediately.  <br />
<br />
1.  My first convention as the Organized Play Coordinator for Decipher (Origins, 2001).  I had only been in my position for a few months and I was thrown into the fire!  I remember running the SW:CCG open at that convention.  I was stressed out, but I think it went well.  I remember that the final was between Clint Hays and TJ Holman.  I thought that I had to do everything, so I didn&#39;t delegate much.  This led me to VERY long hours and a VERY exhausting convention.<br />
<br />
2.  My recent Black Rider tour.  I had a blast traveling to retail locations and hanging out with the players.  It was also nice to be able to participate in the events, which I very seldom get to do when I&#39;m working.  It was great to see everyone so hyped about the Black Rider card and the Booster Draft format.  Can&#39;t wait to get back on the road in a month (hitting Virginia and North Carolina).<br />
<br />
JT: Do you play CCGs very often?  Which one do you enjoy most?<br />
DB: I have been very active in my local community throughout the past three years here in Virginia.  All of my friends were gamers, all of my weekends were spent at the card shop, every Friday night I had friends come over to game, etc.  Recently (3 months ago), I got married to my 8-year college sweetheart.  This has changed my lifestyle a bit (to put it mildly), so I don&#39;t get in as much gaming as I have in the past.  My first love will always be SW:CCG.  It was a great game.  Honestly, I haven&#39;t played it much since Decipher lost the license, but I&#39;ve heard good things about the virtual cards.  The game that I like the best right now is LOTR:TCG.  A great game with lots of strategy and deck-building options.  I really like the direction it&#39;s going and can&#39;t wait for some of these sets that we&#39;re playtesting to come out.<br />
<br />
JT: What fluctuations have you noticed in the frequency of Star Wars CCG tournaments since Decipher lost the license?<br />
DB: Good question.  We have been keeping tabs on tournament activity for all of our games.  Initially, there was a pretty steep drop-off in tournament activity for SW:CCG.  This was happening at the same time that LOTR:TCG was taking off in a big way.  After that drop-off leveled off, it has remained relatively constant.  They have been on a slow decline in the <br />
past year, but are still doing very well.  Kudos to the Player&#39;s Committee for keeping the interest alive.<br />
<br />
JT: What is your opinion of the Classic format?<br />
DB: Well, I haven&#39;t played in it, but I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s fun.  I came i to SW:CCG just after Hoth came out, so I missed out on the Premiere-only environment.  Would be interesting.<br />
<br />
JT: Do you think the Classic format has increased the popularity of Star Wars?<br />
DB: Not sure.  The only thing I have to go by are tournament numbers (which are on a slow decline) and word of mouth.  <br />
<br />
JT: Some of us are very excited about the new Star Trek second edition.  Can you tell us if Decipher has any big marketing plans for this game?<br />
DB: We are excited about it, too.  I cannot &#39;spoil&#39; any of the plans that we have.  Many are still in the works and I don&#39;t want to prematurely talk about something that may or may not happen.  As far as Organized Play for Second Editon goes, we would love to do more.  The DGMA would love to do big things with ST:2E (Premier Series type events), but we&#39;re waiting for <br />
the player base to grow a bit.<br />
<br />
JT: Have you noticed a decline in the first Edition of Star Trek since the second edition was released?  Are a lot of first edition players switching over?<br />
DB: Yes.  We have noticed that a lot of the 1E players are switching over, but we&#39;re also noticing that we are getting completely new players (which is exciting).  <br />
<br />
JT: Star Trek is Decipher&#39;s longest-lasting CCG.  To what to you attribute its success?<br />
DB: Well, it&#39;s a great property that is adored by millions of fans world-wide.  The game is also very good and Decipher&#39;s art team has always given the collector&#39;s top-quality images and card art.<br />
<br />
JT: Lord Of The Rings is now the first Decipher game (to my knowledge) to ban cards instead of using an errata.  Why is this?<br />
DB: Well, to be technical, we created a new tournament format where these 15 cards cannot be played.  There is a difference.  We wanted to maintain an environment where ALL of the cards were still playable (OPEN ENVIRONMENT).  At the same time, we knew that we needed to make a change to the play environment.  We did consider the option of errata.  We felt <br />
that changing the text on 15 cards would be worse in the long-run.  Personally, I worried about the &#39;getting it right&#39; factor.  Nothing is worse than having to errata a card multiple times (see the Mirror of Galadriel)  When tweaking one card, it&#39;s difficult.  When tweaking 15 cards to try to alter the environment, there are LOTS of different ways <br />
to go wrong.  One card could be left too strong, while others would be rendered useless.  And then there&#39;s remembering and explaining what each new text is.  Yes, all of us SW:CCG players out are able to keep track of dozens of errata.  However, we feel that all of the rules changes and errata were a steep barrier to entry to SW:CCG that limited the player base in the later years.   The Standard environment is up and running now, and we&#39;ve gotten reports in from around the world.  They are stating that deck diversity increased and the players enjoyed the format immensely.  We are looking forward to seeing the Standard format in action at the high-level tournaments.  Also, back in the day, Decipher did ban a ST:CCG card (Raise the Stakes).<br />
<br />
JT: Has LoTR&#39;s popularity actually been affected one way or another since the bans were announced?<br />
DB: Difficult to say at this point.  After the initial shock, there have been MANY top-level players that have publically (and privately) praised the Standard format.  They have emailed me privately to say thanks for making this change.  We have also seen this from the road on our Black Rider tours.  I would suggest that everyone at least give a Standard tournament <br />
a try.  We&#39;ve been playtesting the format for a long time, and it&#39;s really good.  Time will tell, but I think that this will increase the popularity of LOTR:TCG.  <br />
<br />
JT: What Cons can we expect to see you at this summer?<br />
DB: All of &#39;em!  I&#39;ll be at Origins, San Diego, Gen Con, DragonCon, and Essen. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=4796&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
