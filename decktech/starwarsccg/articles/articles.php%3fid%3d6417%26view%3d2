Always great to set down with the champ!<br />
<br />
Q1) First off let’s introduce you to people who may not know who you are. How did you get your start in star wars ccg?<br />
<br />
Back in the late 90’s everyone around where I lived played Magic and gradually the game just died off in NE Ohio and the next game just happened to be Starwars. I remember learning it from some guy that worked at the local card store right after Dagoba came out. We used to have a solid group of guys that played in the Akron/Kent area who all started around the same time (early 99’ish). <br />
<br />
At any rate we started having locals and whatnot for a few years, drawing some of the better players in Ohio at the time and some of the dudes from western PA. Despite playing all of the time we never really went to any big tournaments until Ohio states 2000 (which back then was still a 30-45 person turn out, don’t know if anyone else remembers that one, but we ended up playing in some jank-ass restaurant with the best Mountain Dew EVER). I remember going 3-3 and thinking that it was pretty good for the competition I faced. <br />
<br />
Next year, same tournament, I went 6-0 (WYS and ISB, go figure) and subsequently quit the game because of real life issues. I was getting into college and we were having some little arguing problems within our play group. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I came back to the game in late 2004 after a three year break and found what the V-sets had added to the game and started having fun playing again. <br />
<br />
And here it is, almost 2007 and I’m still in College, for the 6th year, studying Education.<br />
<br />
Q2) At world this year you slammed your way through days 1 and 2. Can you tell us what decks you played and why you chose them?<br />
<br />
Sure, on day three I wanted to play two decks that could pretty much play any style that the game demanded. I didn’t want to be stuck w/ a deck like HB for the LS, or ROPS for the DS that gets stuck doing its own thing w/ very little ability to disrupt off their own platform. With that in mind I picked Scum for the DS and Reid’s pipeweed HAT (AITC KDH v) deck. Both decks are very versatile. They can setup at their own sites if necessary, both can go to space and ground, and both can lay the beats anywhere. In other words, I wanted decks with which I was responsible for the wins and losses, neither have auto losses, however, neither have auto wins either. <br />
<br />
Q3) What was your favorite part of worlds this year (besides winning)?<br />
<br />
Ha.. well favorite and oddest are not really the same, but I’ve got to tell the story anyway for those who haven’t heard it. Justin Stratton and I left for Chi-town at about 10ish EST. Around 1-2PM I start thinking about what crappy decks I am going to play in the team tournament and I started to think about one of the HD decks that I brought. After thinking about what I needed to add to the deck before we started I realize that my backpack, w/ all my decks in it, never got put in Justin’s car before we left. shimmer. I panic a little bit and Justin calls his wife Rachel for the super tech play of the day. She breaks into my house, baby in-tow, and FedEx’s my cards overnight to Chicago. Best 35$ I ever spent. Rachel FTW.<br />
<br />
Q4) On that same subject, what has been your top 3 favorite SWCCG moments?<br />
<br />
Hmm, that’s a tough one. One of them would have to be my first game back after a three year break. I’m playing “try and blow stuff up w/ the DS through a ROPS engine” against Justin’s MWYHL. I manage to blow up Dagoba and still lose the game because Justin picks up Yoda like a device w/ the damn backpack. Silly rules. If Dagoba gets blown up, DS should auto win. <br />
<br />
Another would have to be the semi-finals this year at Coruscant regionals. I’m playing Steven Yeager and Reid is playing Johnny Chu. Before the games start Reid and I walk like half a mile to the gas station to grab 2 giant things of water b/c we’re thirsty as all hell. At any rate, after the half a mile walk we get treated to an Amish horse taking a giant crap in the parking lot of the mini-mart, score. After this I somehow manage to drink all of the water that I bought in about 20 minutes, it was about a gallon give or take. Well a gallon of water + no food all day = the lose. During the 2 games that I play against Yeager I think I had to go to the bathroom about 75 times. I think at one point M. Carr was getting ready to finish the game for me if I went to the bathroom one more time. Not to mention it was the weekend of Booker getting made fun of by random old women, so, all in all it was pretty good. Oh, one day Booker, one day you will know the elite sweetness that is the Applebee’s alcoholic beverage <br />
<br />
The last isn’t really one game in general, but the entirety of the 2005 season with AITC. While making people quite and throw their cards on the floor isn’t a good thing for the game, it was funny as hell, and even more funny when people claimed the deck was dead from the counter cards. IIRC I made 5-6 people drop from tournaments w/ that dumb deck. I play 6 characters, drain for 18, retrieve 7 a turn, guess I win. Not to mention that the 2005 season of SWCCG saw the ultimate ban: Kroger’s. I mean, who would have suspected that when I went in to get one case of beer I would wait in line behind the two dumbest individuals on the planet, literally. “No, you can not use the coupon that has a picture of a hotdog on it on mustard, it doesn’t work like that.” I believe that when I walked out of the store towards the car w/ Justin, Reid, Booker and Eier I may have caused a few children to prematurely lose their faith in childhood. (Nate Meeker: Warning, Parental Advisory, Explicit Lyrics.)<br />
<br />
Q5) You’ve had a chance to play some of the best players in the world. Who do you think is/was your toughest opponent and why?<br />
<br />
Not even a contest. Reid Smith. I’ve never played against another player that has consistently kicked my hiney in tournament play like R. Smith has.<br />
<br />
Q6) The Meta. Everyone is talking about it, what is your take on the state of the game and the meta?<br />
<br />
Honestly I really like the meta. Outside of WTO v being a really dumb card I think the current meta is great. There are 4-5 decks for each side of the force that are actually tournament viable, maybe more for the DS in all honesty. I can’t remember another time in my playtime where I have seen so many different decks being played at high level tournaments.<br />
<br />
Q7) What do you think we, as a player community, could do to keep the game alive and attract new players?<br />
<br />
Justin and I talk about that all the time, and outside of some drastic changes to either the current rules (allowing certain things), or the restrictions that decipher has on the PC, its going to be pretty hard to get completely new players into the game. IMO allowing full proxies to be played in tournaments might be one way to go. I know it doesn’t feel all that good for the people who have a ton of money invested in the cards, but I don’t see any other way that we can attract a large amount of new players to a game that not only has a huge learning curve, but also a gigantic library of cards.<br />
<br />
Q8) We’ve been hearing a lot about a match play championship coming in late December or early January. What do you think of this, and the possible seeding structure?<br />
<br />
The match play tournament is something that I am personally really looking forward to. I was kind of disappointed that worlds went to swiss play this year but this event should fulfill that play style. Seeding is kind of difficult with an event like this. IMO the best way to go about it would be have some kind of preliminary rankings (like what we are doing now with the multiple coaches polls) in place a month or so before the tournament happens so that by the time it does actually roll around the seeds should be fairly well in place, also gives plenty of time for people to argue different positions. On top of those rankings I think we should try and get a set list of people that are actually going to show up before it happens so it’s ready to go when everyone gets there. That way there are not a ton of problems that come up because 5 of the top 10 don’t show.<br />
<br />
Q9) If you could change one thing about Star Wars CCG what would it be and why?<br />
<br />
In all honesty I think the game is going about as well as it could for the players currently playing. The PC is doing a great job for the most part and players are showing up for tournaments. The only thing that I would like to see for the next swccg season is a few more large scale tournaments if there is interest for them in the player base.<br />
<br />
Q10) Again Nate thanks for doing this. Any closing remarks or advice you’d like to give to aspiring World Champions? <br />
<br />
Practice and collaboration. No way in hell I could have won day three had I not play tested w/ the rest of team Ohio, Justin Stratton, Brad Eier, and James Booker along w/ Reid Smith and minions.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much Nate! <br />
