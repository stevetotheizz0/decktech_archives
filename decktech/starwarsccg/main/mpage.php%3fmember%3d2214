<br><br>

Gonna start posting some information in regards to Schedule C and Sole Proprietor businesses and the IRS, since I&#39;m seeing some issues pop up on the site from some small business owners.<br><BR>
I&#39;m going strictly off of information taken from news letters our tax research service provider has on their website, information from our CPE courses, and other certified pieces of information.  I will not be discussing my opinion here, simply information provided to me by sources that are known to be trustworthy and have been examined by people with twice my experience and knowledge.<br><BR>

<b>You Are Not a Professional Gambler</b><br><br>

While most individuals are not professional gamblers, the Supreme Court ruled in <i>Groetzinger</i> that an individual could be in the trade or business of gambling (i.e., a professional gambler) if he pursued gambling full-time, in good faith, with regularity, and as a livelihood rather than as a hobby. In that case, the taxpayer had no other employment and gambled full-time at pari-mutual dog racing. The Court found that his activity required skill, which he applied, and was more than a mere hobby. In <i>Castagnetta</i>, the taxpayer held a part-time job in addition to spending about 40 hours per week carrying on his gambling activity (horse racing). Even though the taxpayer was employed part-time in a job unrelated to gambling, the Tax Court held that the amount of time devoted to his gambling qualified this activity as a trade or business. Consequently, the taxpayer can deduct his gambling losses on Schedule C as business expenses and not on Schedule A as miscellaneous itemized deductions.<br><br>

For everyone else - your winnings must be reported on the “other income” line on the front page of your tax return. To measure your winnings on a particular wager, just use the net gain on the wager. For example, if a $20 bet at the race track turns into a $100 win, you have won just $80, not $100. If you lose $50 on a different race, however, you cannot simply offset this amount against your $80 win. <br><br>

You must separately keep track of losses. They are deductible, but only as itemized deductions (on Line 27 of Schedule A of your Form 1040). Thus, if you take the standard deduction (i.e., do not itemize), you cannot deduct your gambling losses. On the other hand, if you do itemize, the gambling losses fall into the category of “Other miscellaneous deductions.” These are fully deductible as itemized deductions and aren&#39;t subject to either the 2% of adjusted gross income (AGI) “floor,” or the 3%/80% phaseout of total itemized deductions. (Some types of miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses and unreimbursed employee expenses are only deductible to the extent they exceed, in total, 2% of AGI. In addition, if an individual&#39;s AGI exceeds a specified dollar amount, certain itemized deductions are also reduced by the lesser of 3% of the excess of AGI over that dollar amount or 80% of the otherwise allowable amount of those deductions.) <br><Br>

A second important limitation is that your gambling losses are only deductible up to the amount of your gambling winnings. That is, for tax purposes, you can use your losses to “wipe out” your gambling income but you can never show a gambling tax loss. <Br><br>

Be careful to keep good records of your losses during the year. Keep a diary in which you indicate the date, place, amount and type of loss as well as the names of any people who were with you. Save all documentation, such as losing tickets, checks or credit slips. You should also save any related “side” documentation, for example, if you have losses on a trip to Las Vegas, save the hotel bill and plane ticket, as well as your records on the gambling losses themselves. (If you are a member of a slot club, it may be possible for the casino to print out a record of your play.) Since anyone can just pick up, e.g., an unlimited amount of losing tickets at a race track, IRS may require more data and documentation to substantiate gambling loss deductions. <br><br>

<b>How is the Value of My Business Calculated</b><br><Br>

Note:  For this part, I&#39;m using one example of how a business&#39; value is calculated.  It is a conservative calculation, so it will be the one a buyer is most apt to use - it gives them the greatest bargain, which means it pays you the least.<br><br>

A small business&#39; value can be calculated using a combination of 9 factors.<br><br>

The first factor is a weighted factor of adjusted net income for the past 5 years.  This calculation takes your net income for the past 5 years, adds back any deductions that were related specifically to the owner, deducts payroll for a manager to come in and perform the same job you were doing, and then weights the most current year by a factor of 5, the least current year by a factor of 1, and the other years by similar factors.  In short, the most important number in this calculation is your end of year net income for the 5 years prior to the sale.<Br><Br>

The rest of the calculations are based on ratios compiled based on your industry.  You can find samplings of these stats by googling Pratt&#39;s Stats.  A single industry&#39;s ratios can cost around $199 to look at.  So its generally something you only want to look at when you are serious about selling your business.<br><BR>

The following are the ratios used:<br><br>

<u>Equity Price to Net Sales</u>: take Net Sales and multiply it by the Equity Price/Net Sales ratio; calculate this ratio for both a 5 year average and the most recent&#39;s year end.<br>
<u>Equity Price to Book Value of Equity</u>: take your total Equity value (retained earnings, additional paid in capital, capital stock) and multiply it by the Equity Price/Book Value of Equity ratio; calculate this ratio only for the most recent&#39;s year end.<br>
<u>Market Value of Invested Capital to Gross Profit</u>:  take Gross Profit (Sales less Cost of Goods Sold) and multiply it by the Market Value of Invested Capital to Gross Profit ratio; calculate this ratio for both a 5 year average and the most recent&#39;s year end.<br>
<u>Market Value of Invested Capital to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization</u>: take your Net Income Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization and multiply it by the Market Value of Invested Capital to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ratio; calculate this ratio only for the most recent&#39;s year end.<br><br>

These previous calculations you use based on the total industry evaluation provided by a business valuation resource such as Pratt&#39;s Stats.  The next two you use an average ratio based upon other businesses in Pratt&#39;s Stats who&#39;s industry and sales are comparable to your own (comparable are considered anything from half of what your gross sales are to 5 times what your gross sales are).<br><BR>

<u>Market Value of Invested Capital to Gross Profit</u>:  (yes Calculate again) take Gross Profit (Sales less Cost of Goods Sold) and multiply it by the Market Value of Invested Capital to Gross Profit ratio; calculate this ratio for the most recent&#39;s year end.<br>
<u>Market Value of Invested Capital to Sales</u>:  take Sales and multiply it by the Market Value of Invested Capital to Sales ratio; calculate this ratio for the most recent&#39;s year end.<br><br>

So the important numbers in this calculation?  Equity (which is the accumulation of the prior years net income), Gross Profit, Net Income, and Sales.<Br><Br>

<b>Calculating Social Security Benefits and Social Security Disability Benefits</b><br><Br>

Social Security benefits are based on earnings averaged over most of a worker&#39;s lifetime. Your actual earnings are first adjusted or "indexed" to account for changes in average wages since the year the earnings were received. <b>Then we calculate your average monthly indexed earnings during the 35 years in which you earned the most.</B> We apply a formula to these earnings and arrive at your basic benefit, or "primary insurance amount" (PIA). This is the amount you would receive at your full retirement age.<br><br>

Your Social Security disability benefit is based on the amount of your lifetime earnings before your disability began and not the degree or severity of your disability.<br><br>

<b>Audit Rates</B><br><bR>

The Department of Treasury issued a report in 2007 asking the IRS to reduce the number of Schedule C losses by increasing the number of IRS audits of taxpalyers with Schedules C, and to establish a "bright-line" test for determining whether an activity is a business or not.  The Treasury Department calculated approximately $2.8 billion in lost taxes to the treasury in 2005 alone.<br><br>

Taxpayers with Schedule C&#39;s are the most likely to get audited by the IRS.  The following are 2006 audit rates based on gross revenue:<Br><Br>
<$25K - 3.8%<Br>
$25K - $100K - 2.1%<Br>
>$100K - 3.9%<br><br>
The general audit rate of an individual is 1%.  The IRS has stated they will be increasing the number of audits they perform on Schedule C businesses.<br><Br>

<b>Hobby Loss Rules and Schedule C Businesses</B><br><br>

Like many of us, you&#39;ve probably dreamed of turning a hobby or avocation into a regular business. You won&#39;t have any unusual tax headaches if your new business is profitable. However, if the new enterprise consistently generates losses (deductions exceed income), IRS may step in and say it&#39;s a hobby—an activity not engaged in for profit—rather than a business. <br><br>
What are the practical consequences? Under the so-called hobby loss rules, you&#39;ll be able to claim those deductions that are available whether or not the enterprise is engaged in for profit (such as state and local property taxes). However, your deductions for business-type expenses (such as rent or advertising) will be limited to the excess of your gross income from the hobby over those expenses that are deductible whether or not the enterprise is engaged in for profit. Deductible hobby expenses are claimed on Schedule A of Form 1040 as miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to a 2%-of-AGI “floor.” By contrast, if the new enterprise isn&#39;t affected by the hobby loss rules, all otherwise allowable expenses would be deductible on Schedule C, even if they exceeded income from the enterprise. <Br><Br>
There are two ways to avoid the hobby loss rules. The first way is to show a profit in at least three out of five consecutive years (two out of seven years for breeding, training, showing, or racing horses). The second way is to run the venture in such a way as to show that you intend to turn it into a profit-maker, rather than operate it as a mere hobby. The IRS regs themselves say that the hobby loss rules won&#39;t apply if the facts and circumstances show that you have a profit-making objective. <Br><br>
How can you prove that you have a profit-making objective? In general, you can do so by running the new venture in a businesslike manner. More specifically, IRS and the courts will look to the following factors: how you run the activity; your expertise in the area (and your advisers&#39; expertise); the time and effort you expend in the enterprise; whether there&#39;s an expectation that the assets used in the activity will rise in value; your success in carrying on other similar or dissimilar activities; your history of income or loss in the activity; the amount of occasional profits (if any) that are earned; your financial status; and whether the activity involves elements of personal pleasure or recreation. 
<br><Br>
The classic “hobby loss” situation involves a successful businessperson or professional who starts something like a dog-breeding business, or a farm. But IRS&#39;s long arm also can reach out to more prosaic situations, such as businesspeople who start what appears to be a bona-fide sideline business. <br><br>
