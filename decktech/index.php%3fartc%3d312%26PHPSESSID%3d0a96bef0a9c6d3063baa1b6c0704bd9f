<tr><td colspan=2><font color=#FFFFFF face="arial" size="2">Most of us have used some type of card organizer or deck-building aid in our card-playing careers. Speaking for myself, most of the programs I've used have been written by two or three guys with a semester or two of high school programming experience between them, and the result is an "adequate" CCG utility that just barely does the most basic operations. Enter the Lone Wolf company. What originally started out as two or three guys with a little programming experience quickly turned into a CCG and miniature software company that has become the dominant force in keeping straight just how many Darth Vaders you have, or what the odds are of you drawing Aragorn in your opening hand. <br />
<br />
I downloaded the trial version of Card Vault when it was first released, just to see what the big deal was. As it turns out, Card Vault is hands-down the best card organizing utility I have ever pointed and clicked at, and it's been recently updated to incorporate even more great features and make it a more streamlined product. If you don't believe me, go try it out for yourself. But first, read what Edward Bolme thinks about it. <br />
<br />
JT: What part do you play in the creation of products by Lone Wolf? <br />
EB: I primarily handle marketing and communications. I create advertising and promotions. I work with manufacturers and data file authors alike to ensure that the games are handled in a timely, accurate, and useful manner. I also write the documentation and tutorials for the product, as well as come up with wacky ideas that create more work for our programmers. As the person in the company with the most card-game experience, I also act as a reality check for new features. <br />
<br />
JT: What CCGs are able to use Card Vault? <br />
EB: Card Vault is designed to support all collectible games, both cards and figures. For active games, we have data files for Buffy, Dragonball Z, A Game of Thrones, HeroClix (all types), Legend of the Five Rings, Lord of the Rings, Mage Knight, Magic: the Gathering, Magi-Nation Duel, MechWarrior, Pokemon, Shadowfist, Star Wars (WotC), Vampire, Warhammer 40,000, Warlord, WWE Raw Deal, and Yu-Gi-Oh! We also have data files for a variety of inactive games: Babylon 5, Dark Eden, Doomtrooper, Dredd, Harry Potter, NetRunner, Star Wars (Decipher), and Wheel of Time. We also have complete spoilers for Doomtown and Rage, and we'll post those as soon as we find either a programmer fan or some more free time. <br />
<br />
JT: Tell us a little bit about the features of the product. <br />
EB: Card Vault does it all. At least, that's the goal, and we're most of the way there. The program handles both deck building and inventory management with as much or as little detail as you wish. We have powerful filter tools. You want a list of all the Star Wars cards that remove build points? We got you covered. Want a list of all Warhammer 40K Space Marines that have a die roll of 3 and are illustrated by either Matt Wilson or Brian Snoddy? No sweat. Need to know how many Scorpion non-Ninja non-Cavalry Samurai with an odd-numbered gold cost are Jade-legal? Easy. The views and list sorting are entirely customizable. See what you want, how you want it. When building a deck, Card Vault tells you if it is legal for the selected format, and if it's not, it tells you why. It also has four Info Windows that can help you analyze your deck's performance. You can display cost curves, quantities of various card types in your deck, or even the odds of drawing a Plains, three Forests, and two Beasts of any type from your deck over the course of various card draws. And if all that data is not enough, you can draw test hands. For inventory, you can track just the number of each card you own, or you can track each card in your inventory by language, release, style, and quality. You can set buy, sell, and trade preferences, and set prices. And, by means of Exchange Files, you can have Card Vault help you find trades with other players. <br />
<br />
JT: How much does the program cost? <br />
EB: The program costs $29.99, and comes with a free year of upgrades and automatic data-file retrieval. It requires a Windows machine (or a Mac with a partitioned Windows emulator) and an Internet connection. <br />
<br />
JT: There are already several programs out there that are useful for card organization and deck building, many of <br />
which are free. What does Card Vault offer that those programs do not? <br />
EB: This can be a tough question to answer, since I am not personally familiar with all the freeware out there. The top thing that Card Vault offers over these programs is flexibility. Our average user plays four different collectible games. Instead of having to learn four different deck-building programs, and tracking his or her collections with an online tool for one game, a custom spreadsheet for another, and checklists or binders for the last two, Card Vault owners only need to learn one program. For deck building, the analytical tools are far more powerful than anything I have seen out there, and the validation ability and test hands are great. For inventory, the ability to use Exchange files to automate trades is cool. Plus, we're working out the arrangements with no less than three sites to allow Card Vault users to download pricing information directly to their computer. Furthermore, Scrye now hosts Card Vault deck files. That means that Card Vault users can download the file of their favorite Scrye deck right to their computers. Once it's there, they can compare the deck to their inventory to see what's missing... and tell Card Vault to add the missing cards to their want lists. As one of our fans put it, "Card Vault is the greatest program you didn't know you needed." I will be the first to admit, it's a program I myself would not have purchased a year ago. Now that I have it, I can't imagine living without it. Naturally, we don't expect people to buy Card Vault sight unseen. Instead, anyone can download a demo version of the program for free and take it for a test drive. Just go to and download it. Step through the tutorial; it's easy and takes just five minutes. We'll also be releasing a free Deck Viewer program shortly. Finally, if you want to read the various reviews of Card Vault, go to and see why everyone thinks we're great. <br />
<br />
JT: Many players have turned to online play via Card Table. Is Card Vault compatible with Card Table? If not, is it implementing an online playing environment of its own? <br />
EB: We're working on coordinating the interface between Card Vault and several online play platforms. <br />
<br />
JT: What inspired the creation of Card Vault in the first place? <br />
EB: Lone Wolf Development actually started by creating Army Builder, which has become the industry standard for miniatures gaming. Although it started out as a tool for the lead programmer and his friends, there are [now] more than 60 different sets of data files currently available for AB, spanning over 55 games (some are foreign language versions). There are at least another 20-30 games that AB is capable of supporting but for which data files simply haven't been written yet (these are tiny games in terms of player base). It seemed only natural to branch that success into collectible cards and miniatures. <br />
<br />
JT: Does the program display card images? <br />
EB: It is capable of doing so, and we're working out arrangements with various manufacturers to do this. <br />
<br />
JT: For those who are unfamiliar with the Lone Wolf company, what other products do you sell? <br />
EB: As mentioned previously, Army Builder is the do-it-all program for miniatures gamers. It covers everything from Disk Wars to Warhammer. And while they are not products, Card Vault's Partner Sites will add a lot of value to the program. Online shopping, auctions, trades, deck archives, price downloads, and more. <br />
<br />
JT: What other products can we expect in the future from Lone Wolf? <br />
EB: We're deciding on our next course of action, but we should be able to make an announcement by this summer. I hope. <br />
<br />
JT: What CCGs do you play yourself? <br />
EB: I am versant in Magic and Star Wars, but my games of choice are L5R, Magi-Nation, 40K, Rage Across Las Vegas, and Doomtown. I also really enjoy MLB Showdown, but I can't scrounge any opponents. <br />
<br />
After our interview, Edward sent me a complimentary copy of Card Vault, so I could share my perspective on the product. Since Star Wars CCG is my primary game, I loaded up the Star Wars (Decipher) file to build some decks. First of all, the list of games and decks you can download directly from the site is massive. Second of all, Card Vault includes every detail of every Star Wars CCG card, right down to how many uniqueness dots there are in front of the card title. My only problem is that the Star Wars (Decipher) file does not yet include cards from the Reflections III and Virtual Sets, but Edward assured me that it would soon. If you play a non-Star Wars CCG game, then Card Vault has all the cards from all the sets (that I know of). This is an excellent tool for a number of reasons. If you just want to keep track of your collection so you know what you have and what you need, Card Vault has no equal. The program is also good for just building a deck. I put in a decklist I had, and not only did Card Vault allow me to draw a "sample hand," which is infinitely useful in refining your deck, but it also showed me the average power, ability, deploy, forfeit and destiny of my deck, as well as a whole horde of other deck aspects that are very useful when you are doing some fine-tuning. Edward said it best - you don't realize how much you need this program until you actually start using it. I've been using the program for less than an hour, and already I have no idea how I ever built decks without it<br />

If we made it for free, we couldn't make it. Part of the reason that it is so good is that this is our job. On the other hand, I am taking apart my binder sets, because I no longer need them for reference, so my collection has just grown by all the cards that sat unused in my binders. <br><br />
The Reflections 3 and virtual sets are now available. <br><br />
Finally, we also have a Card Vault Deck Viewer, which is a free program that lets you view CV deck files like the ones now available at www.scryemag.com and soon to be available here. </font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Edward Bolme</font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Mon Apr 14 2003  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Oh, and we are up to date on all the other games covered by DeckTech. <img src=/news/smileys/smile.gif></font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Edward Bolme</font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Tue Apr 15 2003  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Excellent Edward.
