<br>
First, the DeckTech Player of the Year<br>
<br>
At FreedomCon, we will be presenting an award to our first ever <b>DeckTech Player of the Year</b>.  Now what what makes a DT Player of the Year?<br>
<br>
As you know, here at DT we keep things simple.  Therefore, the Player of the Year will go to the <a href="http://www.decktech.net/dpc/leader/index.php">DPC LeaderBoard Leader for 2002</a>! (Season ends at FreedomCon - starts again after a brief layoff next December)<br>
<br>
So let's briefly recap the LeaderBoard Positions...<br>
<br>
Last we left off, DT Legend <b>Brian Hunter</b> had a narrow $55 lead over another legend here <B>Steven Lewis</b> due to a $40 win at Swtcg!  However, $40 in the high priced world of cash tournaments is not much of a lead.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the indefatiguable <b>Gabe Alonso</b> has been hot on the heels of the two all year, currently clocking in at a mere $95 behind Brian!<br>
<br>
Add in the fact that DPC Seattle could bring about a new entry into the field, and outsider <b>Andy McClure</b> who excells at two games and you've got the makings of one wild showdown in Philadelphia.<br>
<br>
With Brian coming, Gabe and Steven presumably coming, it's going to boil down to that last event.  SWEET!<br>
<br>
Now what does the DT Player of the Year receive?  First of all, he is going to be profiled and enshrined on the DPC Website forever as Player of the Year 2002.<br>
<br>
Secondly, and more tangibly, due to our good friend <b>David Evans</b> at <a href="http://www.myrook.com" target="x">Rook Steel Storage</a>, the winner will receive a special Rook Steel Card Carrying Case with the DeckTech logo!  Cool, eh?<br>
<br>
So there you have it, I know I am seriously awaiting this<br>
<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<br>
Next topic, <b>DeathMatch for Dollars</b><br>
<br>
As you also know, FreedomCon will be featuring a CounterStrike and Medal of Honor tournament for money.  This is Mike Carr's brainstorm, and a fine addition to our lineup.<br>
<br>
The main store in attendance for FreedomCon, <a href="http://www.neoquestgames.com/metadot/index.pl" target="x">NeoQuest Games</a>, regularly runs tournaments like this, and has the schematics all worked out.<br>
<br>
Here follow the rules for each game.  You've got to know the rules to play, right?<br>
<br>

<br>
DPC Counterstrike Tournament Rules<br>
<br>
1.00 TOURNAMENT OVERVIEW<br>
<br>
The DPC Counter-Strike Tournament is a competition using Half-Life Counter-Strike (tm), an action-oriented multiplayer computer game. The tournament series consists of a team format, meaning it consists solely of team vs. team matches. Teams compete for cash prizes.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.00 PLAYER ELIGIBILITY<br>
<br>
2.00a The DPC Counter-Strike Tournament is open to players regardless of nationality, sex or race.<br>
<br>
2.00b The DPC Counter-Strike Tournament is open to both amateur and professional gamers, regardless of tournament experience or corporate sponsorship. Players need not have participated in a previous tournament to be eligible for registration.<br>
<br>
<br>
3.00 REGISTRATION<br>
<br>
3.00a Registration for the DPC Counter-Strike Tournament will take place at the event location at a time to be specified by the DPC .<br>
<br>
3.00c Tournament registration is limited by the size of the hosting venue. A maximum of 40 players will be accepted. These players will be randomly split into teams of 5.  Those who are not registered will not be allowed to compete for that evening.  It is possible that 1 team may have less than 5 players or that players may be bumped from competition if there are less than 3 players on their randomly determined team.<br>
<br>
3.00d By registering and participating in the DPC Counter-Strike Tournament, each participant agrees to be bound by the official rules of this document.<br>
<br>
3.00e Players may not submit multiple entries into registration. Players with multiple registration entries will be disqualified.<br>
<br>
3.00g All registration entries are subject to verification. If an entry has false or misleading information that player will be disqualified.<br>
<br>
3.00h Sponsors and other tournament affiliates reserve the right to use a registered player`s name, photographs, video footage, and/or any other likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without consent from the player beyond their willingness to register and compete in the DPC Counter-Strike Tournament.<br>
<br>
3.00i Submitted registration information may not consist of vulgar language, or any such language that is not suitable for the public.<br>
<br>
4.00 TOURNAMENT STRUCTURE<br>
<br>
4.00a The DPC Counter-Strike Tournament will be a single elimination ladder.<br>
<br>
4.00c All tournaments will be run on an isolated tournament network.<br>
<br>
4.00d There will be no provisions for the replacement of any peripherals.<br>
<br>
4.10 TOURNAMENT MATCH RULES<br>
<br>
4.10a Game Definitions: Match - A game played with each team playing a half match as Counter-Terrorists and the other half as Terrorists. Half - One 8 round map session. Two halves equal a Match. Round - One 3-minute cycle on a map.<br>
<br>
4.10b Each Tournament Round will use one map. Maps will be announced on the day of the event. <br>
<br>
4.10c Only team leaders are allowed to use public in-game messages (messagemode1, referred to as MM1) within a game. This rule also applies when dead. Use of MM1 by any member but the leader could result in a forfeit and loss at the discretion of the referee, unless purely accidental. Other clan members must only use team messages (Messagemode2, referred to as MM2,) while in the game.<br>
<br>
4.10d Team members may communicate verbally if they are alive in the game or if all team members are dead. When a player dies he or she must not utter a word after the instant his character reaches zero health. This means a player may not verbally communicate with team members while his character is dying.<br>
<br>
4.10e Default player models and skins must be used by all team members, any player using enhanced/colored models/skins will result in a forfeit loss for their team. This includes hostage/grenade and bomb skins as well.<br>
<br>
4.10f In the incident of a tie, the two teams will continue playing into sudden death overtime.<br>
<br>
4.10g Each team will consist of 5 players. Only registered players are allowed to participate in the tournament. Should any team have unregistered players, the team will be disqualified immediately. Each team must select a name for their team and also appoint a team captain to represent the team.<br>
<br>
