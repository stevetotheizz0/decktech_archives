DOnt support the new game, let it die, and hopefully it will die quickly </B></font></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="table_bg"><td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Submitted By: sean miller<BR><BR>I havnet bought a Scrye since december or january so i dont know how the swtcg is doing, or lotr for that matter, but i think it will fail, it could get popular for awhile but i doubt it, most people who play swccg are sw fans, sw doesnt pick up a lot of new comers who dont like the movies, so what i mean is, the real sw fans will play swccg because swtcg just cannot capture the essance of star wars in its lame A$$ game. <BR>sean miller<BR><BR>I think Earl hit the nail on the head with that one.  Escaping reality is the point of the game for me, not higher rankings or winning cool prizes, but having fun living in a virtual world where running secret operations for the empire, making smuggling runs to kessel, fighting imperial walkers on Hoth, or training to become a jedi is possible.  I will never give up hope, no matter what (so called) reality throws at me. <BR>Casey Honeysett<BR><BR>Here is how I see things, not if anybody really cares. I live in a world where anything is possible, and I have seen the impossible happen. Hope is what keeps a lot of things alive, and I think we are all entitled of a little hope that one day our beloved game will get their license back. Yes the chances are very small, and if you want to shoot down that hope by looking at that reality by saying that Decipher will never get back their license... well that is your right. When I sit down and play the game, I escape reality. In a lot of ways, that&#146;s what the game is about... for me anyway. So if it&#146;s possible for a Rebel Trooper to shoot Darth Vader with a regular blaster, why isn&#146;t it possible for Decipher to get their license back? What I really mean is if we all start looking at everything in reality, then would we be losing touch of all the things that brought us all to love this game in the first place? No matter what others will say, I will continue to carry hope whether if it is for more virtual cards, Decipher getting back into the game, or even if another company continues where the game left off. <BR>Earl Sessions<BR><BR>Here it is: Lucas owns a lot of stock in HASBRO, which owns WOTC.  Moving Star Wars to WOTC was purely a business decision, since HASBRO already has every other Star Wars license in existence under their umbrella.  The only way that Decipher could ever get the license back is if 5 years from now (the license agreement is rumored to be a 4-5 year deal) SWCCG is still as popular as it is now, and WOTC&#146;s SWTCG is forgotten.  Considering the resources of WOTC, that is a pipe dream and we should forget about it, move on, and just keep playing SWCCG without any unrealistic expectations.  Face reality people.  I think this topic has gone on long enough, and it should end now.  I don&#146;t mean to be anti-Decipher because I&#146;m not, I&#146;ll keep playing SWCCG for-frikkin-ever.  But it&#146;s not healthy to be unrealistic about the game.  I think it&#146;s fine the way it is, and the virtual cards are really awesome.  I&#146;m perfectly content to play with the cards I have, gluing together some virtual cards once in a while, and spending my money on LOTR.<br>And by the way, I am the moderator of the message boards here, and I delete messages that don&#146;t pass.  Ask Casey Merry, his rarely get through... <BR>Ryan French<BR><BR>Since when has an announcement been made that Decipher has absolutely no chance of getting the license back, even if the SW:TCG bites the big one? I have never seen any official notice from LucasArts, WotC, Decipher, or Hasbro to that effect. Do you all really think that LucasArts is going to keep the license with Hasbro/WotC if the game fails to make any money or become popular? They moved the license to Hasbro/WotC because they promised them a lot of money. Do the math, people. <BR>Uriah Watkins<BR><BR>why was my post deleted? DOes not everyone have the right to there opinion here? <BR>sean miller<BR><BR>Had Decipher not made the LOTR:TCG I would feel bad about this a lot more. However they did make LOTRs so people need to stop @#$%ing about a incident that happened half a year ago and go play the new really badass game that Decipher has made. If not then at least shut up and stop bothering the people that knew enough to realize Decipher is NOT getting the license back. <BR>Tom Potter<BR><BR>excellent post, Casey.  as long as we continue to play star wars ccg, it will never die, regardless of what wotc does to their star wars game. <BR>Ryan French<BR><BR>When I first heard about the license deal, my heart sank.  I had been playing SWCCG ever since A New Hope came out, and I was heartbroken.  Suddenly my favorite card game in the world had been taken from me-the game I had been playing for years and had invested many, many hours, not to mention a WHOLE lot of money in.  I didnt seem to talk much for the rest of the day, and I kept moping around, feeling deep depression that would leave an everlasting mark upon my soul (sounds corny, I know).  This feeling lasted for many days, until I decided to watch the three movies that I had grown up on, the three movies that had me captivated with their brilliance and depth.  The Star Wars Trilogy!  After viewing the three best movies of all time, I looked at my Star Wars CCG deck, and suddenly the sad feeling left me.  I picked it up, and decided from that point on that I would never leave my favorite card game.  I will play it until I die, and never give up hope that one day, in a galaxy far, far away, the best card game company and the best movie franchise would be reunited once again...   <BR>Casey Honeysett<BR><BR>i think everyone needs to give up on the idea that decipher could magically regain the star wars license.  it will not happen.  let it go.  even if swtcg flops big time (which it hasnt), the license will not return to decipher. <BR>Mike French<BR><BR>yo, take a chill pill.  WotC&#146;s game is different, not better or worse, just different.  and the reason YJ and JK didn&#146;t do well is because they targeted an audience already involved in SWCCG...WotC&#146;s game doesn&#146;t really have that problem... <BR>Ryan French<BR><BR>Tom, just let me say this: you suck for giving up on the SWCCG. The WotC game will fail for the same reason that Young Jedi, Jedi Knights, and Pokemon failed: the game is too simplistic so when the players get older than about 14 they lose interest in it and look for something more complex. Decipher has already tried marketing a Star Wars game to younger audiences (Young Jedi) and it lasted for only about a year. The WotC game uses dice and counters to play while the SWCCG only uses your deck. For the SWCCG all you need is two 60-card decks and you can play whereas WotC expects you to carry around a bunch of other stuff. And how is WotC going to solve the Anakin/Vader problem when they release the Vader card in the fall? Are they going to make the different eras incompatible? They&#146;re probably going to release a banned and restricted list, too, just like they&#146;ve done with Magic and now even Pokemon. Decipher, however, allows you to play with every SWCCG card they&#146;ve ever made. How can you compete with that level of complexity and randomness? Speaking of complexity, I&#146;ve heard a lot of people complain about how complicated it is to play the SWCCG. Let me say this about that: it&#146;s a fairly easy game to learn how to PLAY, but it gets more complex as you learn how to PLAY REALLY WELL. From what I&#146;ve read and heard, the WotC game is easy and quick to learn and not complex enough to make it a challenge to excel at playing it. Sorry this is such a long post, but I felt this stuff needed to be said.
Like others have said about the WotC game: use it a recruitment tool to get more people to play SWCCG.
The question of Decipher getting the license back is not a question of IF, it is a question of WHEN!!!
Thanks for reading...

:-)> <BR>Uriah Watkins<BR><BR>IT HAS RICKSHAWS!!!!! <BR>Tom Potter<BR><BR>This is how to deal with  the new game. We will play the game . Why? To expose ourselves to those that do. Why? To tell them about the SWCCG from Decipher. Why? To turn them toward the game we love and play. The new game is a tool for recruitment and nothing more. Use it as such and do not bag on it. It can be fun to play even though it lacks everything that we as Star Wars gamers have come to love. <BR>Jason Herrin<BR><BR>i am no longer bitter towards WOTC.  besides, how in the world would Decipher have made Anakin fit into the game??  besides, people will naturally realize that the tcg isn&#146;t complex enough...the game they need is Star Wars CCG, and it&#146;ll always be around. <BR>Ryan French<BR><BR>Hmmm... now where did that reality go? Oh its over there with Wizards basking in the glow of a crap load of money. I got a box of the new game and it doesn&#146;t suck. It no where near the quality or depth of SW:CCG but that won&#146;t mean people will stop buying it. I have come to accept the death of my favorite card game. I know no mater what I do it simply will not return. Now I have go build a deck for the LOTR Open next week. <BR>Tom Potter<BR><BR>Right on dude! I dont like the new SW game.  May Decipher reign with Star Wars once again! <BR>Casey Honeysett<BR><BR>oops, didnt mean to make the title so long, but i was going to say that hopefully it will die quickly and hasbro/wotc is go away.
