<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Mega Announcements for Gamers Today: DPC to restart in Atlanta posted by DeckTech on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br><img src=/news/images/dpc_logo.gif align="right"><br>
You asked for it; you got it.  That's right, the return of the <b>DeckTech Players' Challenge</b>: The DPC.  For our launch event we head back to the South and the home of one of last years most successful DPC's :<b>Atlanta, Adam Drake, and The War Room</b> on <b>April 26-28</b>! <br>
<br>
For those of you not in the know, the DPC was a series of hugely successful cash prize Star Wars CCG events last year.  With the best players attending and winning, guys like <b>Brian Hunter, TJ Holman, and Clint Hays</b>, and the expert play and competition due to the large cash prizes, the DPC quickly became the premier series of events for Star Wars CCG.  The decks became the meta standards, and the players became instant legends.  The DPC events also received tremendous praise for their professionalism and organization.  The culmination of these events was FreedomCon, which became the defacto championship for Star Wars CCG, Star Trek CCG, Jedi Knight and Young Jedi.  In total the DPC gave away over $18,000 in cash prizes last year!<br>
<br>
This year's focus will be on <b>Lord of the Rings</b> with our other games supported as events permit.  These other games will be of course our classic <b>Star Wars CCG</b>, the immensely popular <b>Magi-Nation Duel</b>, and the raucous fun <b>Raw Deal</b>.  Watch for specific event details as they become available. The venues for these events will focus on some of the oustanding retailers across the country.<br>
<br>
Speaking of outstanding retailer's let's get to specifics of the first event.  You don't get any more outstanding than Atlanta's top gamer sanctuary: <a href="http://www.thewarroom.com" target="x">The War Room</a>.  With tons of gaming space, huge card selections, regular tournaments, one of the biggest miniature scenes in the country, friendly staff and ownership, and cheap drinks and eats, the War Room is easily one of the finest gaming establishments in the country.  Bringing you this event will be none other then DeckTech Raw Deal admin <b>Adam Drake</b> himself.  Adam, a DeckTech favorite, was the event co-ordinator last year in Atlanta, and has been a hugely successful promoter of games such as Star Wars, Raw Deal and Lord of the Rings in his area.<br>
<br>
Here is the current schedule for Lord of the Rings<br>
<br>
Friday night(April 26):<br>

<br>
As a "Master Series" event there is no set limit to the prize payout.  It is completely scalable to the event.  The payout structure looks like this<br>
<br>

of that...<br>
50% to first<br>
25% 2nd<br>

10% 4th<br>
<br>
Please note Lord of the Rings players that Number 1 ranked player in the world <b>Trevor "Jangofett" Bradley</b> will be in attendance and ready to take on any upstarts!<br>
<br>
As for other events, there is a strong possiblity of a Magi-Nation Duel event, and Star Wars and Raw Deal are being considered.  To volunteer to help run one of these events, contact <a href="mailto:adamdrake@decktech.net">Adam Drake</a>.  They may be added as space and time allow.  Note that all DPC main events will follow the "Master Series" payout scheme, meaning: Cash Prizes!  To the best of my knowledge this may very well be the first ever Magi-Nation Duel professional tournament!<br>
<br>
As for future DPC's, the next one is scheduled for Las Vegas sometime in May run by another DeckTech legend, <b>Tim Guzman</b>.  Look for details on this and additional events soon!<br>
<br>
With that, I want to say Adam Drake, David Akers and myself, Neal Razi, look forward to seeing all you Lord of the Rings fans and players, all you DeckTechers and everyone else interested in Atlanta.  Bring your most fell decks and your grimmest face and prepare for battle Middle Earth style at the War Room!<br>

The DPC is scheduled for the weekend of April 26th-28th. Things kick of on Friday night and roll throughout the weekend. Also not announced, The War Room will be open 24 hours a day through Sunday.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>Man, i was so excited I knew I'd forget something!  I got it now.  Everyone going make sure you thank Adam.

Neal- Do you have times for the SW Money tournament you just mentioned?  Or if not times, what day it is?  Thanks.  And props to you drake, because you're my idol.  lol<hr>Alexander Bagasra said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>Are there prizes for the people who don't get 1st-4th place?<hr>Andrew Howard said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>Looks like this is gonna be another great year for gaming with Decktech and the DPCs back in action. <hr>Mark Wootton said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>From your comment about 'retailers across the country' does this mean that this will be a US only series. Not being a SWCCG player or from the US I have never before heard of DPC and am curious as to whether it is a world phenomenon or just a local thing <hr>Mark Wootton said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>From your comment about 'retailers across the country' does this mean that this will be a US only series.

I think it should be held in huntsville scence almost 1/2 of the people there are normaly at huntsville every weekend not to mention you we have a stronger player base then atlnata. <hr>Danny Young said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>I have no idea why you chose Atlanta, but Thank You!! What can we expect in the way of MND?<hr>Jonathan Chu said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>Man the Vegas DPC was pretty sweet. I would love to go to that one. Please post details as soon as possible for that venue!<hr>Legolas Greenleaf said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>Yay!!!  More DPCs means more TR's for me to read!!  I'm to poor to make it to any major tournaments and their are very few locals in my area. (closet player, if you will)  I wish they'd hold a DPC in Seattle, Washington or Portland, Oregon cuz' I could probably arrange to go to that.<hr>edmund gray said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>don't worry. i'm sure there will be plenty all around the US in the future.<hr>Ryan French said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>when can we expect an swccg/lotr DPC in seattle?  Soon?  please?<hr>Andrew Harwell said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>Great!  The last DPC Atlanta was outstanding, I know this one will be just as good.  I can't wait to get in on some MND money ;)<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>Glad to see so much interest.  Here you go<br>
<br>
mark Wooten: Europe is a definite possibility, and we really want one there.<br>
<br>
Ryan: Seattle is also a possibility we discussed.<br>
<br>
<hr>Daniel Robertson said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>Great! I hope you put up some MND dates soon ^_^<hr>Hayes Hunter said on Tue Mar 12 2002 <br>damn my profs are going to hate me for missing so many test dates (all of my tests are fridays).<hr>Mark Balderston said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>crapinawrapper . . . i have AP exams the next week . . . and umm they're kind of important . . . but after like may 16th i will be good to go  . . . it's not looking good for this one . . but i'll see what happens.  <hr>Tim Guzman said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>I have a Vegas Date, and A venue ready to go.  Details coming Very soon.  SWCCG, LOTR, and DBZ will be events, if all goes well, but no promises yet, as to what events there will be. :)  And if I can I will be at Alantic as well.<hr>Tim Guzman said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>Hey that is kinda cool, I type in Info Broker, and then my name just shows up instead...maybe because I added my Email address. :)<hr>Steve Marshall said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>HOORAY VEGAS!!! The Vegas DPC last year was the most fun I've ever had on a SW adventure, and I will most definitely make every effort to be there!!! Sweet!<hr>Charlie Herren said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>I -will- be there...<hr>Ricky Myers said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>i'm new to decktech and all this big time tourney stuff, but i'd like to see one of these in michigan, ohio or wisconsin.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>I don't know about those, but look for the possibility of one in the chicago area :)<hr>Matt Lush said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>Vegas? I'm there. Period. <hr>Adam Beauchamp said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>Huntsville better than Atl.? <hr>Adam Drake said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>First of all, in response to Jason Wade, The DPC in Atlanta was on the weekend of a SWCCG world qualifier in Miami, (we scheduled the DPC ahead of the qualifier btw) which cut into attendance. PLUS, i have never heard of any tournament in Huntsville paying out over $1000 in cash prizes or I would have been there. Don't hold your breath for "DPC Huntsville"...<BR><br>
<BR><br>
Now onto other things, any other events, whether they are SWCCG, Raw Deal, or MND will have to be held on either Friday or Sunday. Saturday will be far too busy with a Magic Junior Super Series event, a Warhammer tournament, AND the LOTR tournament on the same day. If anyone would like to volunteer to run an event on Friday or Sunday it would be much appreciated. <BR><br>
<BR><br>
Huntsville.... Hehehehe!<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>DPC's are normally held in larger cities where they will attract the most people. Doing a DPC in Huntsville is a nice idea and would get people from Atlanta and a few other places but doesn't exactly scream, I HAVE TO BE THERE!! like Las Vegas, Atlanta, New York, Chicago, or Orlando.<br>
<br>
It is much easier to fly into the larger cities, especially for our European players and there is simply more to do in the larger cities. I figure after a tournament is over, where would you rather be? Las Vegas, gambling, strip clubs, and world class shopping, or Huntsville.<br>
<br>
I am sure your gaming scene is great but it just isn't the place for a world class tournament like a DPC.<br>
<br>
Atlanta is not far away, drive over and have some fun. I have to drive 8 hours but I will be there.<hr>Steven Lewis said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>My wife and I will be there.<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>Dude, steven, you wil be?  That's awesome!  Man, it'll be good to have you there.<hr>Andreas Petz said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>sweet...<br>
<br>
COME TO EUROPE GOD DAMNIT ;)<hr>Chris O said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>Funny how when I pointed out to Decktech that the players actually put up the prizes they took down my post? <br>
<br>
I don't know about you but $200 for one days work seems like a good deal to me. I have known all of the TD's in Michigan who have run big tournaments (50+ for Wars you have to admit it's big, some even got 80+!) and all have recived far less compensation. <br>
<br>
My point was only to say that if you want to hold a big tournament then shouldn't you put up the prizes? I mean the savior of Wars (joke!) puts up $25,000 of thier own cash to Magic players. Why shouldn't the DPC put up thier own money? If they want the recognition and status that comes with being the "big tournament" why do I have to pay for it? They claim that they are providing what the players want, right? So why don't they put THEIR money where their mouth is? Why is it my responsibility to make thier prizes and torunments a success? <hr>Michael Dalton said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>when you go to a local tournament, do you pay your $5 entry fee?  Why?  Is it your responsibility to make that TD's (or that store's) tournament a success?  Why don't they put up their own money for prizes if they want you to come?  I mean geez, the nerve of these people.  They want you to contribute to something that will benefit you?!?  What kind of people are they?<hr>Scott Anderson said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>To All - If I could make it there I would, but we will have to see.  Am I the only one that hasn't picked up a Decipher SWCCG card in the year 2002?!??!<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
To Chris O. - You ask for 'Decktech' to put up THEIR own money, perhaps you lost site of the fact that you posted on THEIR website.  Which was registered as a domain by THEM, created by THEM, with THEIR own time, and THEIR own money. <br><br>
Oh, and then THEY have the audacity to create DPC's.  This website has been a bonanza for SWCCG players.  Before decktech, everyone knew decipher's website was lacking in certain tournament, and deck areas.  If decktech did anything they at least gave us a 'home' with a freedom to express our voices.<br><br>
Or to break it down for you in simple layman's terms "Step off Neal and David."<hr>Adam Drake said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>Chris, Wizards of the Coast charges AT LEAST $25 for every major tournament they hold. With the number of players that participate in PTQs and Grand Prixs a year. they can "give out thier own money" if that is the way you look at it. What is really happening is they are stockpiling all entry fees for 3 months to a year, and then distributing said amount. ALSO, WOTC is the maker of the game, they make a percentage off of every pack sold. Decktech is a fan site that has no say in the making of the game or a profit from its sales. What we try to do is offer a competitive series of events for cash prizes, and the cost of those events and those prizes is divided up into a small amount for each participant to pay in entry fee. Oh by the way, it is not YOUR "responsibility" to make the tournament a success. That goes to all the hard working folks who sacrifice their time and money to volunteer and give of themselves. Nothing YOU do will make the DPCs a success.<hr>jason wade said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>what was that one toury you held out in illiosis . I forgot what it was called but I never heard of it (no offense to who ever is out there). Look I am not trying to be a hard a$$ but that was not a "larger city" as Mike Blugrum called it. All I am saying is that if you check deciphers web site for which areas have had a constistin toury action every week end then you will see alot of place that would be great for a dpc . Im sorry I was just statin a fact.<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>Come on, spell my name right dude.<br>
<br>
The DPC was held in Normal, Illinois which is just outside of Chicago, IL and that had a huge turnout.<br>
<br>
I was not dissing Huntsville at all, I was making the point that Decktech is going to choose cities where the turnout will be best and a city like Atkanta, Vegas, or Chicago that will attract more people is a better choice than say Mankato, MN, Huntsville, AL, or Rochester, NY. No offense to any of those places at all but they will not attract as many people as the bigger cities will.<br>
<br>
The venue is a big consideration also. The War Room in Atlanta is THE best gaming store I have ever seen bar none. Its huge, the people are cool, and you have a choice of about 5 Mexican restraunts in the same shopping center (lol) and there is much to do in Atlanta besides gaming. Plus, the War Room allows the use of the room for very little compared to others and the prizes will be larger.<br>
<br>
Anyone who thinks Decktech is doing this to make a living better flush out your headgear and realize they do this for love of these games and they are cool people unlike some others out there who think it is because of them that DPC's do well. What a joke. Players show up to play and try to win prizes, so if you think paying $20.00 for a weekend of fun is a lot than by all means stay home and play with yourself.<br>
<br>
Don't complain about the prizes you ingrate, complain to Decipher that they hold 1 large tourny a year and the one they were going to do with cash last year was cancelled for various reasons, while the DPC's went on and gave out a crap load of dough. Decipher doesn't want to get into the money side of it, fine. Decktech did and the games are better for it. Decktech holds big cash tournaments, Decipher sells more cards, everyone is happy.<hr>Michael Dalton said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>Huntsville might have a great local scene, but it's not about local scenes it's about drawing lots of players. No one wants to travel to Huntsville to play, whereas Atlanta is a whole different story.  Besides, Huntsville is under 200 miles from Atlanta, I travel half that far for locals.<hr>Geoff Gallo-Cornell said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>aw man, its during the school year, that means its gonna be a HUGE bitch to talk my mom into lettin me travel all the way to atlanta. dpc atlanta was such a blast last year, id hate to miss it this year :(<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>Geoff, we're thinking about coming up your way, bud too bud!  It was fun hanging out with you at DPC atlanta last year, big time, though.  DOn't worry man, there'll be more, assuming this one goes off like we expect.<br>
<br>
As for huntsville, no offense to it, it's probably a cool place.  I know people in Atlanta, it's got a great store (and owner) in the War Room, and it's got a killer gaming scene.  I hope someday we are big enough to have a DPC huntsville.  It's all good, dude!<hr>Chris O said on Wed Mar 13 2002 <br>Neal, you think you can put my original message up so people can understand what I'm talking about? Or was the truth too difficult? <hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>No chris, I can't.  Because your posts are completely ignorant.  You think you are clever, but really you are pretty moronic, sorry.  As a matter of fact, I'll probably delete anything you say.  You aren't smart, and you really are just making yourself look dumb<hr>Chris O said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>I'm not the one who claims to have given away $18,000. When in fact the players gave away $18,000 to themselves and you pocketed 20%. I don't understand how that is stupid. You put the figures there. I just wonder how you arrived at them?<br>
<br>
Make mine real,<br>
<br>
Chris O.<hr>Dunya Ertan said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>I think having big tournaments made this game (star wars) bigger than it was. It attracted people who wsa just a collector and turn them in to players. I accept to pay 20 or even 25 dollars for a good tournament. This way i know good people will come. Also having tournaments in big cities have there advantages. Everyone can get a room and enjoy there time when they are. Going to vegas for a tournament and turning in to a vaction with friends sounds nice. <br>
<br>
Also, why should decttech give out mass money for a tournament. Last time i look i never pay for anthing here. I dont pay for using there service or there boards. They never asked there members to pay for services. <br>
<br>
Why should decipher give out money? Just beacuse they are rich? no... they are a company that out to make money. Not a non-profit organization. If decipher needs to give money out to lure more people into the game and its in there budget they will. If they dont its there lost.<br>
<br>
<br>
I had stupid arguments about money and what should a company do. Its not up to us. Its up to the CEO, president and stock holders decision. I like big money tournaments just like the next guy, but not push people or companies in to poverty level. THe tournaments must have a even level between entry fee and prize support. To pull people in it should have 500 to get them there and a portion of the entry fee. THis way u know people would show up and encourgage more to show up. THis way win win stitution. <br>
<br>
<hr>Conor Brace said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Come on Chris O., be reasonable.  If Decktech doesn't have any real income itself, where is the prize support supposed to come from?  Neal's personal bank account?  It's purposely reasonable to have the players provide their own prize support.  Wake up--even if Wizards gives out more prize support than the entry fees cover, the players are still paying for it when they pay big bucks for a lot of colored slips of paper.<br>
<br>
And as for the 20% that is "pocketed," that's what allows the tournament to actually happen in the first place.  It costs money to advertise, rent the space, etc.  And even if the organizers keep a little on the side, so what?  Will anyway say they don't deserve some thanks for all they've done for Decipher's gamers?<hr>Justin Desai said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>damn chris a moron, the entry fees for dpcs cover renting halls, chairs, and other such things.  The excess profits then go back to the players...how can you critisize decktech for this?  Anyway what about a DPC boston?  Several good locations, decent player basem big city.  <hr>Efridge Engelhardt said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>I cant wait. I'll be there. And by the way, don't pay attention to Jason Waid. Noone from Huntsville has any problem driving to Atlanta.  Huntsville is so much ass compared to Atlanta. I can't wait. And anyone who hates on decktech should be banned. heh<hr>Law Sterling said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>In regards to Huntsville: If this were only for MN, then Huntsville would be far better than Atlanta; north Alabama is basically the most competitive region in the southeast, and a majority of players that go to the MN event in Atlanta will probably come from here. However, as for the other games, they are dead here, so Atlanta is the better choice.<br>
<br>
In regards to Chris O. - Every organization that awards prizes, be it corporate, such as WotC or Decipher, or private, such as DeckTech, makes claims of how much they hand out at times. And none of it, in any case, is out of their own pocket. As has been reiterated, the prize money is generated by qualifiers, entry fees, and profits from sales, which come from the consumers or users to begin with...<br>
<br>
Do tell me, what ground are you standing on to make your argument? It is weak at best...<hr>Adam Drake said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Hey Law, you still interested in doing MND, maybe on Friday or Saturday night? It probably couldn't start til 8 or so, but there is all night gaming... let me know.<hr>edmund gray said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>If it wasn't for Decktech those prizes never would have been handed out. If you have a problem with a person making a little money for putting time into making a tournament for your benefit...then don't come, it's as simple as that. And guess what Chris:  No one gives a #&!% if you don't.<hr>Damian Loback said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Well its good to see dpc going he efrige and i hope andy can some. This is the only good thind about me moving down south the game play is much better the wisconsin and hey any wisconsin crew coming down to the dpc aim me and we can talk room and board. <hr>Dunya Ertan said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>I think LA needs a dpc tournament. I can put in my time if i get some help..<hr>Chris O said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Ummm what hall and rental fees? Have you ever been to a DPC? I have. They don't pay anything for advertisement, rental fees, etc. If they did do they care to post those costs here so we can see what they are? Also, post how much $ you took in for those events. I think it's called a balance sheet? Any financial documents would be nice. <br>
<br>
This isn't a convention your going to. It is your local tournament put on by two guys from Florida (or where ever). <br>
<br>
Here is where I am comming from: Why do we need to pay 20% to Neal and David? What service do they offer? Why don't they just stay in Florida (or where ever their from) and the guy who runs the local Atlanta tournaments can run the DPC, he will probably be the TD anyway. Then 100% of the fees collected can be given out as prizes. As far as the "world's best" showing up. Go look at the list of names that played in DPC events last year. Now go to any of the big cons this year. Wow the same people. Heck if you want to play them you can probably drive to thier hometown and pay maybe $5 (around here locals are free) and play them. It would cost you a lot less to do either alternative. Heck you could even run your own DPC event and just tell Neal and Dave to stay home. So again what service do they offer for 20% of my money? <br>
<br>
But really, these guys wanna compete with the big tournaments, right? They say they are the biggest, right? Then why are there no garunteed payouts like all the other big tournaments? You can go to a DPC event and pay $20 to win 80% of it back or you can go to Decipher Con and pay $20 (?) and win $10,000. In order for DPC to get that kind of money at it's events you would have to have 600 players. <br>
<br>
So lets say that Neal and Dave garuntee us $3,600 at the DPC Atlanta. That is only 20% of the $18,000 THEY gave away last year, shouldn't be too hard to come up with. Then they can keep the entire $20 fee (like WotC and D do). In case you think they don't have it, remember they pocketed $3,600 last year. If they did give out $18,000, then that was their 20% take and since they are a non-profit organization they should invest that money back into thier events. So how about Dave? Neal? You gonna garuntee $3,600? <br>
<br>
No, I didn't think so.  How about giving away some of that money WotC paid you guys last year? And hey if you guys truly are non-profit where are your balance sheets showing how much you took in and what costs you really had? In case you were unaware that information is public record. Could you post that somewhere on the site? <br>
<br>
Comon' guys get real. They want you to belive they are the biggest and best when in reality they just want 20%. These two are in it for the same reason as WotC and D: $$$. It's not "For the players by the players" any more. It's "For the Neal and David, by the players".<br>
<br>
I'll get off my soap box now,<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Hello, my name is Neal Razi, and Hi, I am David Akers...we here at Decktech run a fantastic webite, charge nothing for it, get a few bucks from ads, put thousands of hours into it every year, and are lucky if we break even. We decided to run DPC's now by giving all of the money out of our own pocket and all the money that is charged for each tournament will go onto a ledger so we can make sure we pay a bunch of taxes this next year.<br>
<br>
We will also pay for the hotel, your rooms, your airfair, parking, food, and your anal bleeding medication from sitting on your duff all day, playing in a free tournament.<br>
<br>
How's that sound Chris O.?<br>
<br>
I would have to say you are a stutard.<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>I was going to email you Chris but I would rather publicly humiliate you instead.<br>
<br>
You obviously know nothing about business at all. Decktech doesnt have to show a balance sheet of any kind, where did you come up with that bright idea?<br>
The dollars they take in are none of your business you idiot.<br>
<br>
I know both of these guys personally. They bust their humps every day to see that this is the best website for gaming on the web, and they do it for free. You think the $3,600 they took in was profit?<br>
<br>
Ever ran a server that hosts about 6,000 members, each with its own dmail account, web page, and trillions of bytes of info? No of course not, if you did, you would know that it costs MONEY and before the DPC ever even started, these guys gave out their own money to keep this site running and it was close to shutting down more than a few times.<br>
<br>
A guy with your intelligence and attitude couldnt make this happen if you tried so piss off and get a life.<br>
<br>
I dont know what your problem is but grow up dude. You wont be on this site for long and while we are at it, I vote for a total ban of your sorry self from Decktech and all decktech events. I mean, who needs your sorry attitude?<br>
<br>
Adios jerk off.<hr>Michael Dalton said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>It's blatantly obvious that Chris O. (Ohara for those of you who'd like to point and laugh when/if you see him in person) doesn't know anything about the DPCs.  Or running big tournaments, or running a website, or doing much of anything really.  He's just some little guy w/ some big personal issues who thinks he knows more than everyone else.  He spouts off this garbage wherever anyone will listen, even over at GPN, and guess what?  Even over there they tell him he's wrong.  These people have no love for DeckTech (or David and Neal) but even they can see past that and realize what a crock of shyte Chris O. is.<hr>Dunya Ertan said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>wow. I can not believe this stupid argument. Hey chris, relax dude. If u are unhappy about the dpc then do not go. Stay home and learn who won the tournament. Let us give are money to dect tech or who ever it is. We do not mind. I think these guys do a real good job (i mean a fabolous job) doing this events. I do not need to kiss no bodies ass concerning this site but these guys and this site is free. They keep it together and offer nice services. SO WHAT IF THEY POCKET FEW DOLLARS HERE AND THERE. Seriously, they do deserve more. I do not know who is david and neal is but they do great job with these events. They built hype, provide mass prizes and activily promote communite selfawareness.<br>
<br>
If u are dissatify about the dpc or there events dont go. Seriuosly, save your money and buy a car, house, another blow up doll or a life. Come on dude, this is not the place for it. If people are dissatified with their work and efforts people would not show up for it. They will be holding the bag. Its not up to u to decide what they should do. U dont pay for the web site end of the months. I dont think u ever send money to deckteck to keep them going. U never lost sleep about keeping the site alive. I think these guys did. Did u ever write to them and say hey do u need help with anything? NO<br>
<br>
SO seat back and let the kids do there jobs. Shit they are doing a good job. I'm happy so is most of the people who use this site. <br>
<br>
<hr>jason wade said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>when you say none of huntsville has a problem you mean you chris and andy but in fact I am not alone on this issue in huntsville. unless you can fit 12 people in andy van then there is no way we are getting ot atlanta.<hr>Chris O said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Funny how this whole arguement is about false advertising. If Neal would put my original comment back you could see that. <br>
<br>
Neal and Dave do a good job of censoring things they don't want you to read. Hey it's their site they can do that. I mean is it really "for the players by the players" if the player has a dissenting opinion? Your right we should ban all those dissenters. Get rid of them so we can all live in a happy utopia where the two guys who started this site took a bunch of money from WotC (pop-ups) and then issue a statement to not boycott thier new game. ( http://www.decktech.net/index.php?l=45&cat= )<br>
<br>
When asked how much they make off of the site they say "nothing". Yet I calculate they made at least $3,600 last year off DPC events alone. That is not counting the banners on the site or Freedom Con profits (yes they donated those but anyone seen a balance sheet proving that?). <br>
<br>
Now in no way am I saying that they can't make money. I also, like you all, don't really know if they did indeed make any money from this. In fact I am happy if they do make money and sadened if they lost their shirts. And I would hope thier profits go up so it would make them some money. I am also glad I don't pay for this site. If they had to charge to keep it afloat I would even pay a small fee to use the site. I am really glad they are filling a void with their DPC events. I also think Freedom Con was a great thing. I have even stated this to them multiple times. <br>
<br>
Oh, yeah that's right David and I have had a lot to say to each other in the past. In fact he agrees with everthing I say. But he still won't show anyone how much money this site, DPC or Freedom Con took in last year. He won't tell anyone what his expenses really were. Why? What is he hiding? I have continually asked him to prove me wrong. Please shut me up, I even asked him. He won't. All I ask is that he (like any other bussiness in America) show us his financial statements. How much money did he take in from WotC? Hasbro? Lucasfilms? Decipher? etc. I wanna know how unbiased he is. I wanna see for myself exactly what "nothing" is. You should question the motives of people who do things because they are "for the players" but when asked how much they make off "the players" they have no comment. <br>
<br>
Yes, I have asked if they wanted my help before. I even told them they could hold Freedom Con in Michigan (that's where you can come see me and laugh at me if you want!). I still have that offer on the table. But I wanna know how much these guys make first. So should you. We all know money talks and what walks. So what is the big deal about seeing where two of the most trusted and coolest people in the game today stand? Why is that so difficult for them to do? <br>
<br>

PS<br>
<br>
Please feel free to email me any comments. I would rather do that then sit here and argue with you all in general. I don't mind responding to your emails. Anyway I figure after this comment Dave and Neal have 2 choices. Reveal the statements or ban me. Which do you think will happen?<hr>Justin Desai said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>balance sheet?  Are they a puplically traded company?  heck decipher doesn't even offer balance sheets nor should they.  Have i been to dpcc?  Yes.  DPC ramapoo, you think it was cheap to rent that?  get 100 chairs at the lest minute?  DPC montreal, the convention hall they rented out?  OH i forgot that was cheap too.  Not all dpcs are in a card shop-h2o<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>I wonder just who you think you are that someone has to answer to you. And why do you really even care.<br>
<br>
I saw your original 5hit stirring comment before it was taken off and thats all it is, 5hit stirring.<br>
<br>
I went to Freedom Con, I saw what was given away, and who cares if they keep the money? They can do what they want to do, and they can ban you or me or anyone one else that they think is a NEGATIVE. Anyone can have a say so to a point and then it becomes stupid, like your silly argument. Get over it.<br>
<br>
I don't think there is anything you can say that would have me or anyone else with a brain in his head believe that they have done something wrong or falsely advertised.<br>
<br>
Frankly, its none of your business.<br>
<br>
When you are a partner or investor, than you might matter, until then shut yo face.<hr>Dunya Ertan said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>i dont think they should ban u. thats extreme in my view<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Dude, we never said decktech is non-profit.  It's a corporation.  Want to know the results?  We're slightly profitable as a corporation.  Which is awesome and I'm proud of that considering the array against us.  But if you look at david and my hourly wage, it's probably like 2 cents an hour.  Boy am I ever making the big bucks doing this!  Besides, even if it were non-profit, which it isn't, we still wouldn't have to prove anything to you.  In case you haven't noticed, you're loser #1, I don't really care what you think or say except that it is irritating and a waste of my time.  I feel completely justified in banning you, because I have things to do, but I just enjoy watching you make a complete fool out of yourself.<br>
<br>
Uh, furthermore, you must be drunk if you think I'd let you organize even a tea party in the name of DeckTech, let alone a DPC.<br>
<br>
Nice to know we're appreciated by everyone else though, really.  I say this in all serious, running DT is a hell of a lot of work and time.  Really, monstrous amounts of time.  But I enjoy it, and the effort is worth it, with all the friends i've made, and all the play improvement i've gotten.  I just try to forget about all the kooks and wackos.<hr>Chris O said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Ok since we now know your a corporation, please publish your financial statements, like every other corporation in America does. That is all I ever asked of you. And I get all this flack for it.<br>
<br>
<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Let me think about it?  no!  that answer your question, Loser #1?  Why don't you publish your tax record?<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Since i know you're dumber than a rock i'll explain, much like DECIPHER, we're a PRIVATELY HELD corporation.  I know these are big words for you.  Tell you what, punk.  When you get decipher to publish their records, we'll publish ours.  If you can't do that then SHUT THE HELL UP, you freak<hr>Michael Dalton said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Try to get financial statements out of Decipher.  When you do that (which you'll never do), then you can come ask for them from DeckTech :).  DeckTech has no stockholders that can hold them accountable, there's no investors who want to see a return, none of that.  Their financial records are their own.  Yes, they might have to file taxes, and guess what, that's none of your business too.<hr>Michael Dalton said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Damn Neal, you're too quick for me :(<hr>David Akers said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Sorry Chris but your a lunatic. You have accused me of all kinds of reprehensible behavior without a shred of anything but conjecture and speculation. It must be truly sad for you. You live in a world where you see foul motives and greed behind everyone you meet. <br>
<br>
I don't even think showing you DeckTech's balance sheet (not that I would) would make any difference, you would rave about how you knew we doctored it or had hidden assets. Do you think for a minute anyone takes you seriously? It's pathetic the level you have lowered yourself to because of your own acidic agenda. <br>
<br>
The truth is simple. We don't collect the remaining 20% from the entry fees, that money is used for paying for expenses, judges, and maybe other prizes if the organizer wants to. Any thing left over is profit to the event organizer. DeckTech sees zero percent of the entry fees.<br>
<br>
You see the whole point is to motivate intelligent people to run high quality events, by giving them a financial incentive. People who run great events like Adam Drake distinquish themselves as great organizers and are given additional opportunities in the future. Bad organziers are not given another shot.<br>
<br>
DPC's are not the only tournaments of course. If you don't like the idea don't come. Or better yet, run your own tournament and make it free and give away $3,000. I bet you could get quite a few people to come but how long could you keep that up? One tournament? Two? The goal is to build a system that supports itself. Going in the red is a surefire way to prevent any longevity. <br>
<br>
Of course no one has to come to the DPC events if they are opposed to them. But do you have to rain on everyone elses parade simply because of your own personal issues? Let people have a great time in peace, or come up with constructive suggestions to improve the system that are financialy viable. Either way, get a grip man. Life is too short to obsess about such a little thing.<hr>Dunya Ertan said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>wow. can i the record too. lol  <hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>neal - please don't ban this guy. my days can be long and boring and this just gives me something to do.<br><br>these guys are 100% open about the DPCs payout and cost. they set the stakes - you decide if its worth it....i only wish i could go to Atlanta.<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>I love this. Very entertaining.<br>
<br>
What I really want to know, and I want to know as bad as Chris wants to know what he wants to know is: Why do you want to know that stuff Chris? What is your agenda here?<br>
<br>
You seem very emphatic and passionate about someone elses business. Last I heard that was called being a busy body.<br>
<br>
You have some malfunction or disease that I dont want to catch but I do love watching you make a complete fool of yourself so feel free to keep it up.<br>
<br>
I help run a corporation that has about $20,000,000.00 a year flowing through it. Do you actually think I would show you my records because you think it is your right or something? Of course not. Why do you think they are obligated to show you financial records? What kind of a moron are you? You really showed your a55 on this thread.<br>
<br>
Here is the definition of a privately held company: PRIVATE<br>
<br>
Get it? Probably not so let me take this opportunity to extend an extra large go eat a bag of 5hit to Chris O'Hara.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.<hr>Chris O said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Thank you for all of your comments. I will no leave you all alone and continue my conversation with Dave.<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Thanks.....I think.<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>i hope "Dave" is your imaginary friend and not David Akers. Because he has got about a million things better to do with his time then deal with you.<hr>Ricky Myers said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>yeah, hopefully this chris o guy hasn't made michigan look bad, cause not all the swccg players from michigan are like him.<hr>Adam Drake said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>I actuyally want to thank Chris for a couple of things... First, I want to tank him for showing us what a grade A a$$hole he is. It is obvious to me that the majority of people who have posted to this article have a modicum of sense and know where Decktech and myself stand on this issue. Let me say it again, LET THOSE WHO WANT TO COME AND PLAY DO IT AND STOP PONTIFICATING ABOUT AN ISSUE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH AND HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT. Secondly, I want to thank him for generating such a buzz for what will be the best tournament held for LOTR since the game came out. We look forward to seeing everyone, whether you are from Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, Florida, or anywhere else you wanna come from. This promises to be a great tournament. Hope to see you all there! <hr>Steve Marshall said on Thu Mar 14 2002 <br>Hey, Neal! I'm sitting here thinking about what makes a good SW player, and a possible DPC side event hits me. Would there be any way (or possibility) to implement something of a tracking contest?<br><br><br>
I see several catagories of hall of famers on the community boards, and Best Tracker would just be good fun. Whaddaya think? ;-)<hr>jason wade said on Fri Mar 15 2002 <br>so what if we don't have the rights to swccg anymore. we can still play and hold tournys for sw even if we don't have the rights. that would be stupid. as long as I have wars decks I will play tournys no matter what.<hr>shawn banwell said on Sat Mar 16 2002 <br>Freedom of speech is a fundamental right in the U.S.A.. Chris, thanks for demonstrating that.  Furthermore, I too, wish to extend my appreciation to the founders and visionaries behind this site.  Make all the money you can so you can quit all external work and make this even better if that were possible.  I feel sorry for Chris because he dug a hole and may never get out.  Please have pity on such a pitiable person.  <hr>Neal Razi said on Sat Mar 16 2002 <br>Check out what WE are doing for LOTR.<hr>jason baretta said on Sun Mar 17 2002 <br>how funny was that? chris o. is clearly a moron. that much is obvious to everyone else here on DeckTech. To Neal and David, why bother even responding to this pro-decipher @ss lick? no-one is bothered by how much money you get from dpc or whatever, we are just so happy you provide us all with the best ccg site on the web, while asking so little in return. Just ban him or let the rest of us amuse ourselves with his ravings, but i wouldn't bother dignifying him with a thoughful response.<hr>Steve Marshall said on Mon Mar 18 2002 <br>um, I refuse to get into this a whole lot, but freedom of speech is a fundamental right that the GOVERNMENT can't take away. DeckTech can do whatever it damm well wants to. ;-)<br><br>
<br>
DeckTech rules.<hr>Paul Myers said on Mon Mar 18 2002 <br>Hey Adam, if you are still looking for a tournament director, I think your best bet might be Jim Colson.  You can find his e-mail on decipher under Tournaments in alabama.  I think I a ton more people would be interested in attending(including myself) if the SW tournament got scheduled or set up.  Thanks man.<br>
<br>
-Paul M.<hr>jason wade said on Mon Mar 18 2002 <br>I can talk to Jim Colson about it too. I am sure he would be excited to run a LOTR tourny in Atlanta for decktech at a DPC. Still would like to see a major event held in Huntsville though :P. lol<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Mar 19 2002 <br>Jason, go for it.  Jim did a bang up job last year, plus I really like Jim.  I think he's irritated with me, but here's how you get him: Tell him there'll be LOTS of stuff to trade!  He can't refuse that :-)<br>
<br>
Paul, buddy, if you want a sw tournament, organize it dude!  We're thin and stretched here, it all depends on what players can pull together.  Talk to some people who might run one, talk to adam, then get it together!<hr>Andrew Howard said on Tue Mar 19 2002 <br>Any chance we will know anytime soon if there will be a SW event? That is the only way I will be showing up and would like to know :)<hr>John Yakulevich said on Tue Mar 19 2002 <br>Dang! I'm  personally dissapointed that Dave and Neil are NOT living like rock stars.Trade the Falcon in for a Mercades! Personally I hope they can earn a living doing this web site and organization. Welcome to America land of the free, home of Capitalisim. Sorry dude , nobody rides for free, you wanna play you gotta pay. You are gonna line somebodys pockets, big D ,or  Wizards for running the tournaments... BUT gentlemen  we have promoted 2 of our own to represent us to the corperations  in the industry.Decktech is a force to be recconed with. They have the attention and respect of the card industry.We air our concerns they (David and Neil) make the concerns known to the card companys.<br>
 Ok so lets say , hypothetically that what has been said is true. Lets say 3,500.00 was EARNED, ok so split that between 2 guys... so you are fussing about 1,700.00  aproximate dollars  a piece. Consider the costs of travel, phone, web site, etc. for making games and tournaments actually GOOD, ok so most kids earn MORE doing a Summer job. Not to mention that they( David and Neil) have to put up with people , like yourself , who frankly , are just envous and make totally UNfounded slanderous personal attacks on them. Sorry, some people need to grow up.<br>
 GO DECKTECK! Yea David and Neil! woo-hoo!<hr>Steve Marshall said on Tue Mar 19 2002 <br>Geez, John - a little excited? ;-)<br><br>
I guess I can't talk. I feel the same way.<br><br>
<br>
Guz (or whoever) - are you looking for any help with the Vegas DPC? I wanna play in the main SW tourney, but I'll volunteer to help out with anything else you need. dmail me.<hr>Scott Anderson said on Tue Mar 19 2002 <br>There seems to be quite a few SWCCG players that are just chomping at the bit to go to a DPC in Atlanta.  I for one would do everything I could to attend, if it were announced.  Alas, the feeling I am getting is that this event will not get organized due to a couple logistical problems involved. <br>
<b><br>
Issues:<br>
<b><br>
Number One - LoTR will be the main event, and rightly so, at the DPC, and as such will be the event on Saturday.<br>
<b><br>
Number Two - Currently a lot of energy by the players and community is being directed at LoTR, again I have no qualms with that it’s just the facts.  LoTR is THE hot game, and as such deserves the main focus and attention of the decktech admin community.<br>
<b><br>
Solutions:<br>
<b><br>
Point One – With LoTR being the main draw, a SWCCG event has two options, as I see it, when it comes to the Atlanta, and future, DPC’s.  One way is that it could be run on a Friday or Sunday.  But we all know that an event on Friday or Sunday, except for big Conventions, is the Red-Headed Step Child Event.  You lose turnout from people who have jobs, and other concerns.  The other solution would be to find another location for the SWCCG event, on Saturday, which now creates two unique problems of its own.  Now the expense for the event has grown, both for the cash cost of the site, and time for organizers to find, locate, and direct players to this ‘other’ site.  _AND_ you now directly compete with players who play both games.  <br>****   Can a LoTR tourney be run in the evening and a SWCCG tourney in the morning?  I don’t know because I have never been to a LoTR tourney.  Maybe start the SWCCG tourney at 9:00AM, run 6 games, out by 5PM, except for the final duels.  Force drops of players that are mathematically eliminated to expedite the tourney.<br>
<b><br>
Point Two – With the main energy being directed towards LoTR we are lacking in anyone who can, or will, step up and run the events.  And I don’t blame them, with LoTR being hot, and the problems mentioned above it becomes a headache.  Perhaps the Players Committee has a solution in the works…  I’ve heard good things about a possible SWCCG in Vegas, we shall see<br>
<b><br>
Da Wrap-Up – I wish I could offer my time, and abilities, to solving this problem.  Alas my job is very uncertain and as such I never can give an absolute guarantee of where I will be.  Any paper work, phone calls, or other jobs that don’t require my physical  presence I am willing to do, lmk.<hr>edmund gray said on Tue Mar 19 2002 <br>what do you guys think about having double/single elimination for SW? that might make things quicker. but might make the winner a little more random...<hr>Kris Lavigne said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>If there is  a Vegas DPC with SW i will surely play, ,even thouhg i havent played in a year, should be great fun.<hr>Tim Guzman said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>Yes Kris there is, and Finally as of now, all is set.<hr>Jim Colson said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>Neal...<br>
<br>
I'm not irritated with you.  I just get busy and don't get to email.. or web pages as often as others do.<br>
<br>
Adam did contact me about the SWCCG event for Atlanta.  I am currently trying to re-arrange my schedule to accomodate for it.  I should know within the week.<br>
<br>
Jim<br>
<hr>Neal Razi said on Wed Mar 20 2002 <br>Cool, dude.  I just posted something about you on the other hof, nominating you, wish i had read this first.  I'm gonna incorporate this in my next announcement.<hr>Adam Drake said on Thu Mar 21 2002 <br>Scott... Right now we are looking at SWCCG on Sunday. The reason we cannot do both in the same day is that the War Room is holding a major Magic tournament and a Warhammer tournament on that Saturday. We are looking at having the premium space, but asking for more is pushing it. We really are looking forward to having a full weekend of gaming. NEAL! I need you to get in touch with Law for me and see if either Friday night, Saturday night, or Sunday will work for him. Thanks! <hr>Paul Myers said on Sun Mar 24 2002 <br>Sounds great Neal, looking forward to the next announcement.  I did actually check in with some people.  Stephen Michael said he couldnt do it and I did contact Jim Colson and informed him about it.  I told drake to conatct him since he is a great TD and practically our best bet.  Thanks for considering all the wars players Adam.  Later.
