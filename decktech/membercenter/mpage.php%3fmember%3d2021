<b>Supply</b><br>
The USA produced 5.9 million barrels of oil per day in 2002, and about 12.6 million barrels of oil per day is imported.<br><br>

Of imported oil in 2002, 31% of the USA&#39;s imports came from arab countries, or only 3.9 million barrels per day. The top countries supplying oil to the USA, and their percentage of the impots, are:<br>
1. Saudi Arabia: 16.9%<br>
2. Mexico: 15.1%<br>
3. Canada: 15.0%<br>
4. Venezuela: 14.4%<br>
5. Iraq: 11.4%<br>
6. Nigeria: 5.9.%<br><br>

(note that canada and mexico together supply almost as much oil to the USA as OPEC countries)<br><br>

The USA:<br>
1. is formerly the Number 1 global oil producer;<br>
2. is currently the Number 2 global oil producer;<br>
3. has produced more oil, cumulatively, than any other country (180 billion barrels from 1918 to 1999);<br>
4. has produced more oil, cumulatively, than the current reserves of any country but Saudi Arabia.<br>

<b>Demand</b><br>
the USA consumed 18.5 million barrels of oil per day in 2002. Of this,<br>
1. 32% is produced in the USA;<br>
2. 68% is imported;<br>
3. 21% is imported from Arab OPEC countries;<br>
4. 20.5% is imported from Canada and Mexico.<br><br>

Of oil per day consumed in the USA, about 65% is used for transportation. This includes gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and residual fuel oil (used for tankers).<br><br>

Of oil per day consumed in the USA, about 45% is used for gasoline.<br><br>

<b>Case Study
Hybrid vs Non Hybrid</b><br><br>

Gasoline Consumption, city driving:<br>
1. Honda Civic Hybrid Sedan -- 48 mpg<br>
2. Honda Civic Sedan -- 29 mpg<br>
3. Honda Accord Hybrid Sedan -- 29 mpg<br>
4. Honda Accord Sedan -- 26 mpg<br>
5. Ford Escape Hybrid SUV -- 36 mpg<br>
6. Ford Escape SUV -- 22 mpg<br><br>

On average, of these 3 vehicles, the hybrids show a 30% decrease in gas consumption. Using this calculation and applying this straight to gasoline consumption (which is a slight overestimate), this would decrease USA oil consumption per day in 2002 to 16 million barrels of oil, a 13.5% decrease. If this decrease was all taken from oil imports in Arab Opec countries, then of oil consumed in the USA, then:<br>
1. 37% is produced in the USA;<br>
2. 63% is imported;<br>
3. 8.7% is imported from Arab OPEC countries;<br>
4. 23.7% is imported from Canada and Mexico.<br>

<b>Conclusions:</b><br>
Replacing the entire USA automobile fleet with hybrid vehicles can be expected to have a significant effect on oil consumption in the USA. While it won&#39;t &#39;solve&#39; the oil problem like hippies want you to believe, decreasing oil consumption by 13.5% is no small feat. Also, if all of this &#39;saved oil&#39; is used on middile eastern oil, more than HALF of middle eastern imports just won&#39;t be imported anymore.<br><br>

However, due to &#39;smart business&#39;, any oil saved due to hybrids would probably come from USA produced oil. Use up other countries oil first, and save your own until the other countries run out.<br><br>

Cost:<br>
1. Honda Civic Hybrid Sedan -- $19,900<br>
2. Honda Civic Sedan -- $13,260<br>
3. Honda Accord Hybrid Sedan -- $30,140<br>
4. Honda Accord Sedan -- $16,295<br>
5. Ford Escape Hybrid SUV -- $27,515<br>
6. Ford Escape SUV -- $19,995<br><br>

On average, a hybrid costs 58% times more than a regular vehicle. That&#39;s a 58% one time cost vs a 13.5% per day savings of oil. To find out how many years it would take to see if this is a good idea from a basic economic standpoint (with the assumption oil supply is unlimited) would require an assumption about average miles travelled per day by american auto users, rate of inflation, and rate of gasoline price increase. I&#39;m not in the mood, tookes.<br><br>

Note that the assumption of an unlimited oil supply is important to simplify the calculation, otherwise the function which represents the rate of gasoline price increase becomes much more complex and reliant on many more factors than I would like to rely on. <br><br>


<u><H1>Hybrids</h1></u>
<b>Is a hybrid more efficient than a regular car?</b><br>
Some basic motor theory will say yes. An electric motor has this huge advantage over a combustion motor of being able to work in a regenerative phase -- that is, work like a generator. For example, if you take an electric motor and put energy into it, you get energy out.<br><br>

How does this translate to a vehicle? Braking recharges your battery! Compare this to a combustion engine only, where braking only slowed you down. Where else does the energy go? heat.<br><br>

<b>What are the downfalls of electric motors?</b>
Well specifically there&#39;s that whole TORQUE thing. An electric motor is SUPER INEFFICIENT with torque. Hugely. Massively. Disgustingly bad at it. Electric motors are VERY INEFFICIENT at low rpm high horsepower regions... basically, Acceleration. Holy crow can you drain a battery dry in no time flat with this. pretty much instantly.<br><br>

But, gas motors are also best at high speeds. where does this leave the electric motor?<br><br>

A large combustion engine is not really needed for high speed, it is needed for horsepower. Tons of fuel is &#39;wasted&#39; when you have a bigger engine than needed. A hybrid has a smaller engine. This engine is not powerful enough to really give a car the &#39;get up and go&#39; it really needs in city driving. Here, the electrical engine kicks in and gives it a hand. Ideally, when the car breaks, all the energy the car had at the higher speed is stored in the battery and then re-used to get the car back up to speed.<br><br>

in a 100% efficient world, a hybrid would only use gas for the first time it accelerates to a high speed ever. After that, all energy &#39;lost&#39; when slowing down is stored, such that if you never accelerated faster than it&#39;s first time, you would never ever consume energy from an external source ever again (barring going up hills).<br><br>

This is also why a hybrid has pretty much no difference between highway driving and city driving -- the engine is already being fully used at highway driving, the extra energy is the electric motor.<br><br>

<b>Wow, that sounds great!</b><br>
Yes, a car with regenerative potential is very good!<br><br>

<b>Why do i feel a but coming on here?</b><br>
Something most non-engineers ignore is that everything is made somewhere, and energy is used to make it. There&#39;s a reason a hybrid costs about $5,000 more... the energy in that battery came from somewhere! Guess what makes energy? oil and pollution. You, by the SOLE act of buying a hybrid car, are consuming more than a person who buys a regular petroleum car. (barring any other acts such as using it). There is NO GUARANTEE that the gasoline you don&#39;t buy by using a hybrid car is equal to the extra consumption you have comitted by buying a hybrid car.<br><br>

Also note that the electric motor is being used in a region which it SUCKS POWER LIKE THE WORLD WAS ENDING. Electric motors are not efficient in this region. The amount of energy put into that electric batter/motor is far less than what you are getting out of it since it&#39;s being used in this region. The only small consolation here is the advantages of regeneration allowed by this motor. Of course, I&#39;m not qualified to tell you if the extra energy not wasted by allowing regeneration is able to offset the energy waste by using an electric motor!  It&#39;s possible hybrids are <i>more</i> energy inefficient than regular cars -- they just get their energy from elsewhere.<br><br>

<b>There must be an advantage to moving some of the energy consumption away from the gas station and to the factories and power stations, though...</b><br>
Yes, if all our energy comes from one source, it&#39;s easier to clean up and/or replace. Moving our consumption closer to the source isn&#39;t a bad idea... but it doesn&#39;t solve anything on it&#39;s own. It&#39;s still energy and it&#39;s still polluting.<br><br>

<b>What about that expensive hiney battery?</b><br>
Current estimates say the battery will last 150,000 to 200,00 miles. Nothing i could find *KNEW* though, it was all supposition. I wouldn&#39;t worry about replacing the battery.<br><br>

<b>Maintenance?</b><br>
Be aware that hybrid&#39;s have more mechanical parts, meaning a higher chance of mechanical failure (Fast supposition from propability knowledge: the increase in failure is most likely super minisucle. a car already has a gazillion mechanical parts -- adding a few more isn&#39;t really going to matter).<br><br>

<b>Why get a hybrid?</b><br>
A hybrid simplifies where our energy consumption comes from, moving it closer to the power plants instead of in our backyard. While this may not reduce our consumption nor our pollution, it at least moves it away from our cities, and concentrates it in a spot from which we will be more able to clean it up or make it more efficient.<br><br>

<b>Would Sagan&#39;s new car be a hybrid?</b><br>
I would definately consider a hybrid over a regular petroleum vehicle -- but not because of energy reasons nor world-wide pollution reasons. As I&#39;ve stated, a hybrid is Not neccesarily more egologically friendly on a global level than a pretroleum vehicle (in fact, it may be WORSE. It might be better, it might be worse, no guarantees). A hybrid is ecologically friendly on a Local level though! <br>
