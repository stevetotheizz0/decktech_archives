No, I’m not discounting my opponents’ skills, I had just been stuck running tournaments and not being able to play. The one tournament I did hit was a three-round Storyline where I lost one game, got the bye and then won the final game. Needless to say, I was in a bit of withdrawal. So I get my little brother Luke and we hit late night league tournament at Century Magic.<br />
<br />
We get down there and see that they have the Core league stuff and decide to sign up. Well, the store has changed a bit of their pricing scheme and the total is $7.00 each for League sign-up and tourney. That was a bit of a pill to swallow seeing as the store doesn’t throw in extra packs for prize support. Generally they had let you play in the tournament for no additional cost if you were signing up for league. So I fork over the money and start looking forward to when End Zone Comics will be having a regular League night. Their league price and tourney price is much better suited to the players.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I digress. I am in a conflict over which deck to play. I’ve got an Underneath deck based closely on Andrew Harwell’s Unmake deck and a Core Flip-Kill deck with a Warrada/Golthub/Harror line up. I tease the Tournament Director Jason Neilson if I should go mean or meaner. He tells me to play tough as there were a few quality players in attendance. Well, meaner was the Core deck. Even though it still needs a few kinks worked out of it, the deck is very efficient and can be quite quick. I fill out my paperwork and wait for pairings. Jason gets things running pretty quick and we are off and running with eight players in attendance.<br />
<br />
Here are the details of the games:<br />
<br />
Game 1: Me vs. Cory Stowe’s Arderial deck.<br />
<br />
Cory’s a younger kid and so I get a bit sloppy. I underestimate Cory with his Arderial deck and proceed to setup Warrada and blow through his first Magi of Aula, Mindseeker too quickly with a Cataclysm (should have just used a Shockwave) from Tomes of the Great Library and a Maelstrom from hand. Lasada comes into town and plays two Xyxs and then I realize that I had left Warrada with only 4 energy. Oops! Xyxs get boosted up by Lightning and such and then zap Warrada into defeat. Golthub comes out ready for a flip kill but then I realize that Lasada still has 5 energy on him. I have no Maelstrom or Dark Ayebaw so I try to go on the defensive. Golthub gets killed on the next turn without taking out Lasada but sets up Harror fairly well. I plow through Lasada with a Dark Ayebaw trick (where I unwisely discarded a couple of Maelstroms for the Implode power) and hope to draw into another Maelstrom one fairly quickly. Ora comes out for Cory and plays a Yarothis (Yikes! Anti-Core) and an Elder Xyx that he pumps up to huge proportions. He leaves his Magi at 0 energy. I energize up to 13 or whatnot and I’m primed perfectly if I can draw into a Cataclysm. I play Dark Portents and see 4 creatures so I end up back up to 15 energy. Then Secret of the Books comes down and I use it to try to draw into a Cataclysm. I see 5 creatures and draw to the max of 4 cards but don’t get squat. I’m merfed and Cory feels it. I play a Dark Furok in vain and draw my two for the end of the turn. Cataclysm ends up to be the first card I draw! DOH! I helplessly watch Cory sweep through to take me on his next turn. Full Loss.<br />
<br />
Props: Cory played well and held on for the win.<br />
Slops: One more card is all I needed to draw…. One more card!<br />
<br />
Update on the Luke: Luke’s Kybar deck trounces a Orothe Interchange/Control deck rather handedly with only Kazm going down. He’s pretty pumped because he’s always had problems with Orothe and he took it to town. Good for him!<br />
<br />
I try to play a game with another kid (not with my Core deck) between rounds for more League points but right as it gets interesting the new pairings are called and I have to end it.<br />
<br />
Game 2: Me vs. Jason Neilson’s Hyren Weave.<br />
<br />
Jason is the Tournament Director and generally only plays to prevent a bye. He’s a great guy but the infrequency of playing kind of brands his playing style. That said, he’s got a Weave Hyren deck that really shows a bit of promise. I win the roll but opt to go second. He sets up several Hyren with his Wence, The Wanderer but they all get swept away by a Tomes’d Cataclysm. He shakes his head and proceeds to his next Magi. Learning from the last game, I had left an Orok out in front of Warrada just for some protection. Jason plays a Blade Hyren and Chasm Jile with his 2nd Magi (can’t remember who it was) and Brushfires my Orok down to 1 energy. I attack his Blade Hyren with the Orok and then play Turn to grab the Blade Hyren from him. Jason shakes his head, leaves the Chasm Jile there for defense and plays another Blade Hyren with another creature. I play Haunt on his Blade Hyren and then attack with mine netting me another full strength Blade Hyren! We both chuckled that that was a fun little play. Anyway, a Dark Ayebaw comes out to take out the Chasm Jile and his other creature gets killed trying to take down the Blade Hyren. I take out his 2nd Magi leaving Warrada open to an assault. Jason’s scrambling to make up lost ground when he reveals his third Magi Scyalla. He named ‘Forest’ as his type so I figured a Forest Hyren or so would be showing up soon. He takes a turn to set up Scyalla before taking Warrada down and before I go to my second Magi he has two Forest Hyren and two Grass Hyren waiting for me. He’s feeling pretty secure when I ask him if the Forest Hyren count as Weave or not due to Scyalla choosing ‘Forest’. He assures me they are. I proceed to flip Golthub, Maelstrom his Magi to zero energy and choose Weave as the region to defeat. Golthub pops it and Jason is defeated. Full Win.<br />
<br />
Props: Jason for his attitude. Getting flip-killed isn’t fun but he was very impressed with the mechanism. Blade Hyren attacking a Haunted Blade Hyren was uber-cool.<br />
Slops: Not much. Warrada sure whupped on things pretty good.<br />
<br />
Update on the Luke: He’s on a roll and trounced a Cald player pretty convincingly with his Kybar deck. If he can hold out he has a real chance of taking his second tournament in a row.<br />
<br />
Between games, I end up trading a foil Wasperine Stalker, Foil Cauldron of Ice and an Iceberg Hyren for a hug load of D’Resh cards and a first edition Ormagon. Not a steal of a deal but fairly favorable to my side. Got to love between round action like that.<br />
<br />
Game 3: Me vs. Joseph Houskeeper’s Orothe Interchange/Control deck.<br />
<br />
Joe’s an older player more along my age-wise.  I had seen him around but hadn’t played him before. We introduce each other and get to business. He’s playing an O’Qua/M’Rika/Shaper’s Apprentice lineup that doesn’t focus on relics. Through the game he plays a ton of Wellisks, Phrups, Coral Hyren and Reef Hyren. Unfortunately, this control type deck doesn’t fair too well against creature less decks and fairs even worse against Cataclysm that can’t be Phrup’d. O’qua comes out and gets wiped fairly quickly due to Cataclysm. M’Rika comes down, sets up a bunch of creatures and then interchanges with Shaper. I play another Tomes and Cataclysm things again as I am going totally creature less. I Corrupt a couple times which nets me a couple Phrups and Turn a couple Sea Barls that he had used and suddenly have literally the same draw engine that he is using! Joe’s playing like a pro though and searching for a way to get out. Unfortunately, Warrada was the queen of control with this deck and had 40+ energy on her one time. Shaper goes down and M’Rika tries to do the job. When Joe finally did have creatures out, he couldn’t get enough to take Warrada down. While I’m enjoying amazing card drawing, I can’t get to anything to take him down with both Tomes gone and no way to play the Cataclysms or Shockwaves that I need. Finally Joe is setup with a used Sea Barl and a big Coral Hyren and is able to kill Warrada. I play Spirit of The Core to steal his Coral Hyren when I flip Golthub. Rather than waste Golthub, I Maelstrom his Magi and Dark Ayebaw his Sea Barl. We shake hands and talk about how his Control deck got Controlled! Full Win.<br />
<br />
Uber-Props: Joe was great. He had a great attitude all the while his deck got clocked by a creature less deck that was Controlling.<br />
Props: Spirit of the Core. No better Spirit card for game-turning advantage!<br />
Slops: Hmmmm….. 40+ energy on Warrada and not being able to kill off my opponent?<br />
<br />
Update on the Luke: Well, he went down to the wire against Heather Dismuke with a very well built Naroom deck. At the end, he was able to belt the Baby Furok’s effect and blast through to win the game on his last Magi! Great game and great tournament win for my little brother!<br />
<br />
Final: Well, I end up in third place and congratulate Luke on his win. The Naroom <br />
<br />
Final Props and Slops:<br />
<br />
Props:<br />
* Jason Nelson for running yet another great tournament.<br />
* My brother Luke for winning his second tournament in a row. Don’t start getting y quite yet my friend!<br />
* Joe and Jason for their good natured approach while taking a beating. <br />
* Cory for dealing a blow to Warrada and the Core<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
* Me for playing Flip-Kill Core. While it didn’t run the table as I thought it would, I’m glad people weren’t offended at the thought of having to play against it.<br />
* Century Magic. Great store but $7 for League and Tournament isn’t too conducive to a lot of players. Hopefully I can figure out their thinking one on one.<br />
<br />
Take care and keep on gaming!<br />
