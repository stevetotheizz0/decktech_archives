Tournament time! I hadn&#39;t been to a tournament for quite a few monthes, and as an added bonus, it was a base-set sealed deck tourney - something I had never tried before. I was pleasently surprised.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there were only four people there, which was a bit of a downer. However, having been to a tournament at this same location before (Twin City Comics), I happened to know everyone there. Along with me came my friend, Ryan, who had never been to a tournament. The other two players were Barry Callisto, the tournament director, and his nephew, Sabian. After waiting for a bit, we decided that it was only going to be us four, so we quickly began choosing our decks.<br />
<br />
As luck would have it, I ended up playing Orothe, the one region I had never touched before. Ryan, on the other hand, got a nice dice roll and chose to play Arderial, one of his most experienced regions. Sabian happened to get his favorite region, Cald, and Barry wound up with Naroom. We proceeded to build our decks for about thirty minutes. Getting a particularly odd set of cards to work with, my deck resulted in this:<br />
<br />
Magi -<br />
Orlon (Starting: Abaquist, Sea Barl, Submerge)<br />
Mobis (Starting: Bwill, Submerge)<br />
Orthea (Starting: Sphor, Paralit, Corf)<br />
<br />
Creatures - 18<br />
Karak x1<br />
Paralit x1<br />
Corf x1<br />
Wellisk Pup x1<br />
Sphor x1<br />
Bwill x1<br />
Abaquist x1<br />
Thunder Vashp x1<br />
Gum-Gum x1<br />
Arbolit x1<br />
Colossus x1<br />
Orpus x2<br />
Plith x2<br />
Sea Barl x3<br />
<br />
Spells - 12<br />
Undertow x1<br />
Will of Orothe x1<br />
Shockwave x1<br />
Vortex of Knowledge x1<br />
Lightning x2<br />
Submerge x3<br />
Implosion x3<br />
<br />
Relics - 9<br />
Corf Pearl x1<br />
Relic Stalker x1<br />
Water of Life x1<br />
Dream Balm x1<br />
Ring of Secrets x1<br />
Channeler&#39;s Gloves x1<br />
Baloo Root x3<br />
<br />
TOTAL: 40 Cards + 3 Magi<br />
<br />
So...that&#39;s the best I could make. I put in all the multiples I had of any card in the deck (in other words, everything that&#39;s a single is because I only had one), and I put in every Orothe card I had. For what little strategy I had, I used Orlon first because he starts with a Sea Barl, so he became my setup magi. I played Mobis pretty offensively, and he was second so his effect would be of some use. Orthea didn&#39;t have much going for her, but she was the only other magi I had. Anyway, on to the results.<br />
<br />
The first match had me up against Ryan and his Arderial deck. He began the match with Lasada, and myself with Orlon. His deck mainly consisted of low energy creatures like Thunder Vashps and Lightning Hyrens, and he was particularly fond of his Pharan/Cloud Narth combo - after all, this was only base set, and in this case it was quite nasty to deal with. After some offensive play with Abaquist, Sphor, and Corf (primarily), Orlon triumphed over Lasada. Next up was Shimmer, who&#39;s new bunch of energy was quickly used to bring about a healthy swarm of low energy creatures, which (one turn later) became a rather unhealthily large Lightning Hyren and an accompanying Xyx. After a lucky draw for Orlon, I came up with my Shockwave, wiped out the Hyren, Vashp-ed the Xyx, and finally attacked and defeated Shimmer with a rather large Karak and an Orpus. Ryan brought out Stradus last, and brought down the severely hurt Orlon with some Shockwave-and-attack action. My next magi was Mobis, with whom I used a Colassus/Will of Orothe combo (destroying his newest bunch of small creatures) and soon had Ryan on the ropes. As the time limit of 45 minutes was coming to a close, Ryan realized that he probably couldn&#39;t defeat both of my remaining magi in time, so instead he worked on creating an extensive creature wall. I used lightnings and small creatures to counter it, and victory was within my grasp when the time limit ran out. Score: 0/0/1.<br />
<br />
In the opposite match, Sabian was facing Barry. A particularly long stalemate ensued between Evu and Gar, with many Grows versus Fireballs. They tied as well.<br />
<br />
The next match had me up against Barry. Under normal circumstances, I should have had the advantage in this duel; however, due to the fact that my direct discard was extremely lacking, I wasn&#39;t able to utilize one of Orothe&#39;s biggest strengths. Barry led with Evu, and drew. And drew. And drew. Having a massive hand, he summoned out a small army of Naroomlings and began using Grows and Tap Roots to make them nice and big. On my side of the field I was not so fortunate. I started with my Abaquist and Sea Barl, but proceeded to find a distinct lack of creatures. Through the use of Carillions, Evu soon defeated Orlon. With Mobis I threw down my Bwill and eventually couple of Pliths to make nice little wall, but after that my creature drought continued. I managed to get rid of his largest creatures with Shockwave and Undertow, but he recovered quickly with a Giant Carillion. After going for four turns without any creatures in my hand, Mobis was soon brought down. Orthea was up next, and once again I had creatures to work with. After a bit of Corf-ing, his Giant Carillion was defeated, and soon Evu followed suit (his energy expenditures finally caught up with him). However, this had taken its toll on me, too - I was left with a fair amount of energy on Orthea, but no creatures on the field or in my hand. As Tryn popped up, Barry sent down a massive army of Pliths and Weebos and was able to quickly beat down Orthea. After a six-turn drought of not drawing any creatures (excluding those I got from Orthea&#39;s starting), Orthea was defeated. Score: 0/1/1.<br />
<br />
Another tie at the other table. Ryan&#39;s Arderial deck had Sabian&#39;s Cald down to its last magi, but in the end the time limit prevented a decision.<br />
<br />
The final match of the day put me against Sabian and the Cald. I was determined to at least pull out one win, and luck was on my side this time. Sabian started with Gar, and played out a Lava Balamant, A Bwill, and an Arboll. Utilizing Orlon&#39;s above average energize, I Shockwaved the Arboll-ed Balamant, played an Abaquist and a Sea Barl, Submerged the Abaquist, Lore-ed with the Barl, possessed the Bwill, and finally Implosioned with the remaining cards in my hand, defeating Gar. Whew! A rather shaken Sabian played Sinder next, and proceeded to make a pumped-up Quor. Because Orlon was lacking energy and I lacked much of a hand, I just threw down a meat shield (I can&#39;t remember what) and let Orlon gather up his energy. Sabian summoned a few small creatures and ended his turn. Sadly, this is the part of the match which is simply eluding me; I cannot remember exactly what happened. However, what I do know is this: Sinder was defeated before Orlon, and Orlon was left with 0 energy and a two energy Sea Barl. Grega was up next for Sabian, and she made short work of Orlon after bringing out an Arboll-ed Lava Balamant (again). Next up for me was Mobis. Lady luck had brought me an Undertow, a Hubra&#39;s Spear, and an Implosion, and...well, the rest is obvious. Using his massive amount of energy, I Undertowed the Balamant, Speared Grega, and Implosioned her mangled self. Hence the match was over. Score: 1/1/1.<br />
<br />
Barry was triumphant again, and Ryan&#39;s Arderial suffered a loss. So ended the tournament.<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s that! Barry came out on top with 5 points, followed by myself with 3 points, and Sabian and Ryan tied for third with 2 points apiece. As for prizes, I won 25 animite and a Morag&#39;s Gift, Ryan got 10 animite and a Comet Hyren, and Sabian got 10 animite and Pyte (an advantage to having so few people at the tournament was that prizes were spread gratuitously). Barry refused a prize due to the fact that he directed the tournament, which was a class act. All in all, this was a great tournament - I got to try a region I had never played before, we all got some promotional cards, and, most importantly, we all had a bunch of fun. Finally, to anyone within a couple hour&#39;s drive away from the Twin Cities, I&#39;d highly recommend coming to the tournies held at Twin City Comics every other Saturday (if you&#39;re interested, d-mail me).<br />
