When I first read about the triple DPC on decktech, I was thrilled and dismayed at the same time.  On one hand, I was extremely excited that a DPC was coming up and it was relatively close to my house.  On the other hand, the tournament would be very close to Christmas, when plans are always hard to solidify, and I would not have my box of Voice of the Storms until after Christmas.<br />
<br />
That said, I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to put together a Nar or D&#8217;Resh deck like I wanted too, but I did devise a few deck options that wouldn&#8217;t require too much of the new set.  First, a given deck choice for me was an Arderial deck with the new Shimmer.  I love Arderian Adept, and I love Arderial, and I love being able to Cataclysm and then Jetstream a creature to one-turn kill the opponent.  My other option was a long-awaited Underneath strategy.  I have always said that if Underneath got a solid draw engine it would be a very viable deck type (see my article on decktech, &#8220;Less-Creature Deck&#8221;).  When I read the new set, specifically Gogor&#8217;s Spade, I knew the time was right for Underneath.  At the same time, Myka, Celebrated Hero, Emaal, and Unmake were all knew to the region, and they are all SUPERB cards.  So, I made versions of both decks and tested repeatedly online.<br />
<br />
Both decks were looking strong, but I couldn&#8217;t find any deck that would beat my Austrian friend Darkness&#8217; D&#8217;Resh deck.  I never got a chance to test my Underneath against it, but I knew the Arderial deck couldn&#8217;t beat it, and the Underneath deck went undefeated in playtesting.  So, after many friendly opinions and much deliberation, I decided to go with the following Underneath deck:<br />
<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Unmake</font><br />
Magi (o3)<br />
Myka<br />
Emaal<br />
Celebrated Hero<br />
<br />
Creatures (22)<br />
Akkar - 3<br />
Ormagon - 3<br />
Hubram - 3<br />
Granas - 3<br />
Sikra - 3<br />
Pylofuf - 3<br />
Grakkanden - 2<br />
Freep - 2<br />
<br />
Spells (14)<br />
Thunderquake - 3<br />
Unmake - 3<br />
Resonate - 3<br />
Crushing Fungus - 3<br />
Impact - 2<br />
<br />
Relics (4)<br />
Gogor&#8217;s Spade - 3<br />
Rayje&#8217;s Belt - 1<br />
<br />
Total : 40 + 3 Magi<br />
<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Day of the Tournament</font><br />
I had a four hour drive ahead of me, and though originally I was planning on driving and bringing some of my pals from Georgia along, none of them were able to go, and my mom didn&#8217;t want me to drive alone, so she decided to take me (which was great, because I slept the entire trip).  When I get to Alabama, I eat at the Atlanta Bread Company (go figure) and then go on to the tournament location.  When I walk into the store, I only see two people playing (the website said to be there at 12:00, it was about 12:30), and I was a little nervous.  Five minutes later two more guys walk in and we all start talking and playing.  I play my Aderial deck in pickup games, and it performs extremely well.  I begin to doubt my deck choice, but when a few of the guys say they are going to play Core in the tournament, I remember the DPC Atlanta (see my report) and decide to stick with the Underneath.  As 1:00 rolls around, Jamie Kelly, the tournament director at the Atlanta DPC, his girlfriend and Haven owner Jennifer Tibbs, and some more players show up.  At this point I get really jittery, and not because I had already drank four Mountain Dews- every person present was a great player, and  I knew accomplishing my goal of a top four performance would be difficult.<br />
<br />
When Law arrived we began registration, and just for entering the tournament we each received the Storyline card Rejuvenate.  We give thirty more minutes for any last minute arrivals, and we start at 2:30 with ten OUTSTANDING players.<br />
<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Round 1 vs. Jamie Kelly- Harresh/Ythra/D&#8217;Jarvish</font><br />
I should have known that with my luck I would receive my hardest pairing first round.  He wins the die roll and goes first, flipping Harresh.  I cringe at having to play D&#8217;Resh first round.  His first play is a Bottled City that nets him an Ormagon from my deck.  He says this isn&#8217;t the creature he wanted because it was only a beat stick against me, plus it was too expensive even with the Bottled bonus for his current plans.  He Time Shuffles like crazy, and  plays a Xala.  I flip Myka, draw five random cards, Unmake the Xala, resonate the Bottled City and play a creature.  <br />
<br />
Well, from here on out Harresh&#8217;s Time Shuffle really nets him an advantage.  His hand got large very quickly, allowing him to Rayje&#8217;s Belt my Burrowed creatures (and Magi) and destroy them with Sunburn + Bulabantu, Crushing Sands, and Unmake.  I had the most difficult time destroying Harresh because of two cards that would reappear in nearly all my matches: Climbing Staff and Spirit of Rayje.  Every time I would attack Harresh to zero he would have a Spirit of Rayje ready, and every time I would Impact or Resonate he had the Climbing Staff.  Once again it was Harresh&#8217;s insane drawing ability that kept him with the resources needed to stop me.  I finally kill Harresh by attacking after battling back and forth between his illusions and my defensive creatures.  <br />
<br />
Ythra flips, and with Jamie&#8217;s insane hand and Ythra&#8217;s insane energy advantages, Jamie destroys me quickly.  Props go out to Jamie for his great Illusion deck, I am always pleasantly surprised with the Alabama tech.<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Lessons:</font> In testing, I never realized how much trouble Rayje&#8217;s Belt would give me.  I should have thought about it and included Beam of Light, but because I didn&#8217;t Jamie was able to Belt Burrow (one of my main advantages), Invulnerability, Rolling Thunder, or any other power that would otherwise have helped me.<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Record:0-1-0</font><br />
<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue>Round 2 vs. Patrick Walker- The Dark Twins/Warrada</font><br />
He flips the Dark Twins and grabs Entomb, Corathan, and Corrupt.  He first Entombs Cleansing because he knows I am playing the Underneath, which is usually a good play, but a dead one against me.  He plays Corathan, Dark Furok, and Corrupt and passes the turn.  I flip Myka and draw my five cards.  I give him Hubram with Corrupt, which returns Entomb because of Corathan, then play a Granas, and finally Crushing Fungus my own Hubram so that he cannot energize.  On his turn, the lack of energize hurts him, and he only Entombs Thunderquake before passing the turn.  On my turn I play Pylofuf and pass the turn.  On his turn he energizes and plays another Corrupt.  I energize, Unmake the Dark Furok, Unmake the Corathan, attack the Dark Twins, and Impact the Pylofuf to kill them.  He flips Warrada and gets Tomes of the Great Library, Warrada&#8217;s Ring, and Orok. I don&#8217;t remember exactly how the following happened, but I know that he destroyed Granas, I played a Grakkanden and Crushing Fungus&#8217;d something, and was then able to attack and kill Warrada with Grakkanden.<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Lessons:</font> Thanks goodness I played the Underneath, since Entomb and Corrupt hurt the Arderial more than you know, not to mention he would have been able to reek more havoc with his large creatures.  Plus, Impact is a great Dark Twins killer since it counts as two magi.  <br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Record:1-1-0</font><br />
<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Round 3 vs. Jennifer Tibbs Delia/Sorreah/Ora</font><br />
Jennifer is the owner of Haven Comics, and she&#8217;s a great person.  She was extremely nice to me the entire day, and made my eight hours of driving/riding in the car worth while.  If you are reading this Jennifer, thank you again!  Well, Jennifer is also playing Arderial beats, and when she tells me Jamie helped her with her deck I am thinking Spirit of Rayje of Climbing Staff all over again.  I win the die roll and go first, playing an Akkar.  She reads it and knows it has to go since she is playing Swarm, so she plays Vellup, Elder Vellup, Alaban, and Undreams the Akkar.  On my turn, I know from playing with Delia swarm that if she doesn&#8217;t die quickly I will be doing the dying, so after a disclaimer that I am not always this reckless, I Thunderquake her all her creature for ten, play a Sikra, and Impact the Sikra.  She doesn&#8217;t having the Climbing Staff or the Spirit, and both Magi go down in flames.  <br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to me this was a better play than I realized since her next magi is Sorreah.  Normally she grabs spells to take out whatever the opponent has in play, but since I had nothing in play her Crushing Winds, Shockwave, and Sorreah&#8217;s Dream won&#8217;t be as useful.  She has a Japanese Foil Vellup in her hand from her opening draw, and he plays a min-swarm with Sorreah.  We both laugh about the oddity of Sorreah having more Vellups than Delia, and she tells me that after the large Thunderquake she misses playing Bograth because of Moob Ring and such.  On my turn I flip Emaal, Crushing Fungus one of her little creatures, and play Grakkanden (since it is Shockwave/Crushing immune).<br />
<br />
We battle back and forth for a while, and even have a Lockdown war (my shiny first edition Belt versus her shiny first edition SIGNED belt).  She is locking down Grounding and Rolling Thunder, while I am locking down Suppress so that she can&#8217;t kill Emaal and get away with it.  Finally Emaal takes Sorreah, but Ora comes out, plays Xyx, Xyx Minor, Xyx Elder, Rayje&#8217;s Belt Emaal&#8217;s Sabotage and then kills her with a five for the Xyx Elder.  This makes me extremely nervous, since I had never gone to Celebrated Hero unless I was losing.  I Crushing Fungus the Xyx and play a few creatures.  I remember her Jetstreaming out something and we had an all out creature brawl.  Finally my immense discard engine (fueled by Gogor&#8217;s Spade) overtakes Ora, and I barely eek out the win.<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Lessons:</font> This game was tough and nerve racking.  It was a true test of my wits under pressure and luckily I was able to think it through.  Grakkanden is a beast against Arderial since it is out of attacking range for most and can shut their spell removal down.  Creature discard is some good.<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Record:2-1-0</font><br />
<br />
Going into the next round, there were only two undefeated players- Jamie and Casey Pirtle- and Casey had a draw.  I knew that if I won this next match I would make top four, but if I didn&#8217;t win my day would be done.<br />
<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Round 4 vs. Max Stevenson- Harresh/Ythra/Hasseth</font><br />
All day everyone has been telling me that Max is one of the good players in Huntsville, and believe me, that is saying a LOT.  I also know that he is playing an Illusion deck, and although it is pretty different from Jamie&#8217;s deck, it is still D&#8217;Resh and D&#8217;Resh is still good.  I don&#8217;t remember many of the specific details of this game because it was rather long and kept a steady tempo of you play a creature, I kill it, you play a creature, I kill it.  Here is what I do remember:  Gogor&#8217;s Spade netted me a lot of cards when it remained in play or un-Belted, and Tradewinds, Harresh, and Daydreams netted him so many cards that for most of the game he had EVERY SINGLE CARD IN HIS DECK in his hand.  That is a first for me.<br />
<br />
However, even with the large hand, I kept Harresh low while I built a large hand with Myka, and every time he would play a creature I would Unmake, Thunderquake, or Crushing Fungus it so that he couldn&#8217;t make any serious gains.  He was also running Spirit of Rayje, and I ended up using a dice to count how many times he played it, and needless to say he used all three possible times during the course of the game.  I finally defeated Harresh, and when Ythra flipped and played a lot of creatures I had all three Ormagons in my hand to deal with them, even though it meant I had to kill the Xala in attacks first.<br />
<br />
Finally Hasseth flipped, but I don&#8217;t remember seeing any Warrior&#8217;s Boots from him the entire game, so my creature removal just proved too much for his Illusions.  For the win I ended up Resonating and Avatar&#8217;s Staff and two energy off his Magi at the same time.  <br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Lessons:</font> All day my deck performed as I designed it to.  In this match it did so particularly well, and I was able to win on Myka.  While my high energize rates made the difference in every game I won, they largely impacted my advantage in this game.<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Record:3-1-0</font><br />
<br />
I went over to watch Jamie and Casey&#8217;s match after I had finished, and I saw that Casey and Jamie were both on their last magi.  D&#8217;Jarvish was sick in Jamie&#8217;s deck, but Casey played supremely well to survive long enough for the draw that got him into the top four.  Because Casey and Jamie drew, I went into the top four in second place!!!!!  Here was the top four:<br />
<br />
1. Jamie Kelly (D&#8217;Resh Illusions)<br />
2. Andrew Harwell (<----------me!) (Underneath Spell Control)<br />
3. Casey Pirtle (The Dark Twins)<br />
4. Connor Gilliland (The Dark Twins)<br />
<br />

I had reached my goal of making it to the top four, but now I wanted to make the finals.  Knowing that Casey had performed much better against Jamie than I had, I did not for a second underestimate Casey&#8217;s ability, and this game required a lot of thinking on my part.  The details of this game were fuzzy, but I remember all the key plays.  He played Chaos Jile, Wudge, Zungg, Raveled Drush, Drush, and Orok, which, though usually the superior creatures of Core, all were easier targets for Thunderquake, Crushing Fungus, and Unmake.  At one point he had only a Chaos Jile in play- I had an Ormagon as my only creature removal in my hand, and an Impact.  I asked him how many cards were in his hand- seven.  With only seven cards in his hand, I thought the odds were in my favor that he didn&#8217;t have a Climbing Staff for the Impact..................  He did.  A few turns later I drew the other Impact, which invoked a Spirit of Rayje! (argh!)  <br />
<br />
Myka burned out after he used Tomes of the Great Library to Crushing Fungus my own creature, and she fell down hard.  Emaal flipped, and he was somewhat weakened.  We had some creature battles back and forth, with Gogor&#8217;s Spade netting me cards left and right.  A turning point came when I attacked and killed his Raveled Drush and Gogor&#8217;s Spade netted me a Crushing Fungus.  I Crushing Fungus&#8217;ed his Wudge and played a Grakkanden.  With little energy left on the Twins, there wasn&#8217;t much he could do.  On my next turn I was able to attack and kill the Twins (hooray!) and play a Granas and Sikra.  He flips Warrada and grabs all her starting and here we go.  <br />
<br />
He makes a large mistake here, but I almost did too.  With twenty two energy on Warrada and my Grakkanden at four from attacks, he pays twelve to turn the Grakkanden.  I sighed and was just about to hand him the Grakkenden, but right then I said , &#8220;Uh, I&#8217;ll use Grounding to cancel it&#8221;.  Boom, my three energy for his twelve energy.  From there he really wasn&#8217;t able to recover, and Emaal made short work of Warrada.<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Lessons:</font> While it does feel somewhat tainted that I won on his miscalculation, it does feel good that I made a deck that was able to handle that situation.  Another thing: After so many times of being reminded that taking a huge risk pays off only 10% of the time, I have finally decided that I will no longer kamikaze my magi and leave myself defenseless.<br />
<font color=&#8220;blue&#8221;>Record: 4-1-0</font><br />
<br />
So now I make it to the finals with Jamie Kelly.  I am so excited that I made it to the finals at a DPC that it doesn&#8217;t even bother me that Jamie is probably about to win.  I made a joke that this reminded me of those Karate Kid type movies in which the hero faces the super-nemesis early in the movie and fails miserably, then learns his lesson and beats the nemesis in the finals when it really counts.  Only time would tell if I would get my own slow motion sequence and dramatic sequence.  <br />

Well I certainly did get my battle music in the form of techno and Prodigy.  At first the game was light-hearted and humorous as one the store employees (nickname: &#8220;The Ultimate&#8220;) kept a running comic routine about Horse Races.........  After a while Jamie asked them politely if they would tone it down a notch, and the game went into to serious gear.  The game was almost exactly like our match-up in the first round.  His card drawing, death stallers, and Rayje&#8217;s Belts kept me in serious check, and I had nowhere to run.  A particularly deadly combo that he used a few times during the day to kill more than one of magi was to Lockdown Burrow (hurting both Myka and my defensive creature), then Sunburn my defensive creature, Warrior&#8217;s Boots in a Bulabantu, killing the creature, and then attack and defeat my magi.  The only difference between our first match-up and this one was that  I got him down to D&#8217;Jarvish this time!  Woohoo!  <br />
<br />
So...... I came in second place at a DPC!!! Yay!  My dreams have been realized :)  And just look at all the prizes I won for coming in second:<br />
AI Forest Hyren<br />
AI Rayje&#8217;s Belt<br />
AI Thunderquake<br />
Tempest Hyren<br />
50 Animite<br />
2 Japanese Packs! (Including Barak and Yaki)<br />
A Bag of Japanese Glass Energy Counters with the Energy Numbers Floating Inside!!!!!! (I thought this was hilarious, since only a week before I told my friend how awesome it would be if counters like these existed)<br />
<br />
The day was over and I made the long trek back, arriving home at 1:30 A.M.  It was definitely worth it!!!!<br />
