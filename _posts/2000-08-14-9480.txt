Strategy: 

I just made this deck last week so I haven't played it against alot of other type of decks.
This deck is really fun to play.All you do is pull out the docking bays and battle with the walkers so you have lots of cards under Insignificant Rebellion so it is easy to cross Luke the dark side. The reason Crush is in there is to get Evader to protect Vader from a beat down and have him go to the used pile and to pull I Have You Now for battles with Vader and the Emperor.
That is basics of the deck and how to play the deck.
