Strategy: '

The object of this deck is Capture that's why you want to start with Dengar with Dengar's Modified Riot Gun (for the +3 bonus and immediate capture) Once you get a couple of captives and there are a couple of different ways to do that, once that's done take them to the prision and drop them off...then wander over to the Interrogation Room and start Force Draining there with Bonuses...Also make good use of that Aiiii Ai Agggggggggg that's a good potential Force Drain with th bonuses of Dark Deal. With this deck and Dark Deal in affect with Aliens and Force Draining its a secure deck in what it's meant to do. Also don't forget the Bounties to be played before you capture because you want to retrieve that force and the Aiii Aii Agggggggg to use again and again.

Enjoy in good health '
