Strategy: '

*Deck Edit*
Toss Demotion, Landing Claw, and the YT Transport for Yoda, Daughter, and Test 1 in order to deal with space decks you think I’ll have such a problem with. If you want to find room for a Uncontrollable Fury, that’d be a good idea too. And as for the non-interaction; I didn’t say it wasn’t, I just said it was a good deck. I know it’s a pain in the ass to play against, but look at the meta. This is the best deck to play since it beats everything.

*Deck Edit*
The Signal x3 should be We Wish To Board At Once x3. Sorry. That makes so much more sense.

Hit and Run is a difficult deck to play because you have to make hard choices of what to play and when to play it every turn. With this deck, its all about early damage, and then the lockdown.

This deck should never lose the podrace. If you lose the podrace, you must be having insanely bad luck. This deck has, and should always beat Brangus, Watto, and HuntDown podracing. In fact, this deck is designed to beat those specific decks.

In any case, after you win the podrace, this deck is simply evil. Draw Their Fire + I Did It keeps the opponent from playing any interrupts during battles, or makes them lose force for doing so. Between the 5 AFAs, 2 Effective Repairs, and all your forms of retrieval, you will be playing more like 8 or 9 AFAs. Draw Their Fire damage will add up during the course of the game since you will be attacking so many times, and then you can finish your opponent off with drains if youve cleared all their characters or just use battle damage.

Some card choices

Jar Jar What a machine. Hes the spy that can go everywhere, he takes out key aliens and droids, and he always stays alive because of Brisky Morning. Huge part of this deck.

On the Edge Extra retrieval, but mainly for the beast combo. Also works to sucker opponents into deploying. Wait for them to commit, suicide your character, then beat down next turn.

YT + Landing Claw Personal preference. I like it because it gets you around CHYBC and because it can block a space drain. Between the Claw and Demotion stopping Chiraneu, space cant drain you for that much. But take it out for Test 1, Yoda and Daughter if you want. I might do that too.

Both Kinds of OOC The original is key to getting rid of important characters, but I switched two out at the last second so I could cancel Phantom Menace. But its your choice.

Gift of the Mentor This is the battle damage part. Jar Jar removes one character, Obi and Luke will both hit (near guaranteed), and you get 3 destiny that will average a total of 15. You can see where Im going with this.

Why not the combo DTF/BP Because DTF retrieval is so huge to the deck. In the average game, you will attack at least 10 times. Thats a 20 point force swing, almost as much as DS podracing. Huge. Plus, the Signals will let you pull Battle Plan without a problem.

Some basic deckmatchups

Any Podracing Deck 
You will win the podrace unless both people get extreme luck; you bad, your opponent good. Then its basically game over. The OOCs and Bith Shuffles stop Brangus from switching key things, Vader will not stay on the table for too long in a HuntDown deck (and hell probably be OOCed), as will Watto. Jar Jar can take him, or any Luke or Obi. Remember, between the 3 Resiliences and Bacta Tank, you will always have characters. 

Any Mains Deck
Just battle away. DTF will score a podrace type force swing in this game. You can clear stacked sites with no problem. I cleared this site - Vader, Tarkin, Dr E, Emperor, Iggy - in two turns. Jar Jar twice, Demotion on Tarkin, swinging with the EPPs. Too Close for Comfort stops swings and shots. This should be an easy game.

Space Decks
The harder matchups, but not an auto loss at all like you will think. You will destroy anyone that trys to satisfy Battle Plan so AFA will take its toll. You will win the podrace, and an early Jar Jar will stop Merrejk and maybe cause some battle damage. The Landing Claw will stop one drain while Demotion will stop Chiraneau. In the end, you just do more damage than them, and you have retrieval.

Senate Decks
Andy McClure already admitted in his strategy that he auto loses to Dagobah. This one is slightly different, but you can change 3 cards to make that auto loss a reality. Senate cant stand up to this deck, period. Lotti Doddi is the only version that has a chance, but not when the important characters are OOC and the beast combo is stopped. 

If anyone doubts the merits of this deck, it is 9-0 in tourney play, 4-0 of that at the Montreal DPC. It has proven that it can win. Enough of me. Enjoy the non-interaction.  '
