Strategy: '

This deck is ready for just about anything you throw at it.  The main purpose of this deck is to blow the Death Star sky high and make your opponent lose force fast.	Against operative decks it kills with force drains at systems and under the Hoth Shield.  This deck is good at hanging in to the very end with 2 Death Star Plans and a Bothan for massive Force Retrieval.  Against Operative Decks I'm usually draining for 8 on the 5th or 6th turn.  The Out Of Commission is included in this deck because people keep bugging me with Fears, so with Out Of Commission I place the thing out of play.  Most people think this deck sucks because it's based around Attack Run but with Attack Run I only need to draw 2 destinies with a total of 7 or more to blow the Death Star up.	This deck has never been in a tournament but I'm sure it will get past at least the third round.	 '
