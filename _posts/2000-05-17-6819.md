Strategy: '

I made this deck using TR start to try to throw them off. It also gives you good activation, start first, and give's you a place to deploy Incom Corporation.

The other locations are either twix where they can't drain or they are 2/2 or 1/1 sites where you can drain for 2. That means if you can't beat em down you can drain up to 8 a turn.

The 8D8 and Artoo are for numbers. First turn try to get one down and insert. ASP-707 is so speeders can deploy cheaper and you can get some back in your deck in the late game or if you need them somewhere else. Just recicrculate them and draw em up next turn. H'nemthe is good for Rops decks and they won't be able to get out their Imp's cheap enough. Romas Lock is for reacting decks and he's also a pilot so put him in a speeder.

The speeders are in that combination so you won't get Monnok'ed a lose like 10 Sandspeeders. Other than that customize your combination to your liking.

I only have 3 interrupts. I made this deck in like 15 minutes so it might not be too great. I just threw in Signals for effects and Transmission Terminated for Visage.

I have like a large number of effects. Multiples of Draw Their Fire, Frozen Assets, and Flaps cause they're kinda necessary for beatdown. I need 2 grabber's for Torture or SAC or anything else. Wise Advice is for SAC and so grabbers are cheap. Do, or Do Not is for SAC. Insurrection is for when you drop 5 or 6 speeders on a lone guy and he Elis Helrot's away. Yarna is to protect from Monnok. Civil Disorder and Wars Not Make One Great are to force the opponent to activate and deploy guys.

Nudj's are there so the fake start goes on for as long as possible and the small space package is for Battle Order or stopping a space drain.

Basically you want to insert and get droids out early. When they start to put guys out for Resistance or draining beat them down with speeders. If they don't lose from battles use drains of 2 at your 2/2 sites and 1/1 sites. I haven't tested this deck yet so let me know how it goes if you use it. Once I start testing it I'll post a revision soon. '
