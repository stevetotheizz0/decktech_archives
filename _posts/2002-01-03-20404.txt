Strategy: '

This deck can be either a beat down or drain making it a little more versatile.  Start 3 effects; strike planning, squad ass, and either menace fades or insight, depending on what dark side’s playing.  Get out your systems and some ships to them early.  Coruscant slows his deployment and it’s a nice drain system.  If security precautions is on table and they have air take it out before you flip or else they can probe like mad and not take battle damage.  ote helps if they keep running away.  On the ground keep harrassing them with your mains and then put your guys in the tank so they can come back 4 more.  If you lose a valuable card early get it back with tibrin’s text then retreive the 3 cards you exchanged with on the edge.  Liberty is in here for forfeit fodder since it can keep coming back after you forfeit it.


Match-ups

TDIGWAT Start menace fades as the third effect.  Use signal to get bacta tank and keep making suicide runs with your mains.  In the air control his bespin and his cloud city to slow him setting up dark deal and cco.   

HDADTJ  Start insight and get honour.  Cancel his visage with ooc/tt and kill his vader and make sure vader doesn’t come back.  After that just drain in space.    

Combat  Try to avoid combatting whenever possible.  The rest of the game is just draining.

Walker Garrison  Start menace fades.  Put projection of a skywalker on his 3rd marker.  Never leave your starships alone at hoth since he can get a star destroyer out there with prepare for a surface attack.  If you can keep menace fades working you should be alright.  This game will most likely become a drain race.

Defensive shields are close race, grabber, aim high, don’t do that again, do or do not, ounee tay, ultimatum, any 3 others
