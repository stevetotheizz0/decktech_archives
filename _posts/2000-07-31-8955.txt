Strategy: '

This deck is pretty self explanatory. Just use Squadron Assignments to get people and ther matching ships out  because they can Pretty much hold a system on there own. One of the cool things about this deck is on the second turn you can get lando out on the falcon.Use the Admiral Order to make all of your starfighters immune to attrition less than 6 and it really hurts the bounty hunter ships because they are all power -2.
One of the main things with this deck is that you want to have one of the 5 Barriers in your hand so you can try to avoid getting in battles that you wont win in especialy if you have StkrikeForce working because it gets placed in used pile if i lose a battle.Strike Force is definetly a big part of the deck if you can control a battle gruond site because my force drains may not be modifeid by opponet While im canceling 2 of his drains.I think the deck is pretty good any advise is appreciated.
