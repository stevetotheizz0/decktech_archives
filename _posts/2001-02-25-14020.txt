Strategy: 

     ***UPDATE*** Goo Nee Tay cannot hurt this deck too much. I have four Alters and enough people to use them. I can always use M’iiyoom’s text. If they use Shocking Information, I can use one of my four Senses. That is why I have four Senses and Alters!
     Strategy: This deck idea was taken from various Manipulation/Miiyoom decks out there on DeckTech. First and foremost, I would like to give credit to those people for providing me with such a cool deck idea.

     This deck plays for a non-flip of the objective, and uses it for activation purposes only. This deck can activate so much by turn two, its just incredible. First turn, pull Rendili, activate your five, then pull the Docking Control Room 327. Put somebody there (Miiyoom if you have her), pull ALL of your Docking Bays, and draw up for Miiyoom if you dont have her already. 

     Turn two, activate your 10-11 or whatever force, scan with Miiyoom, pull the War Room from reserve, then put guys at multiple docking bays for more activation. 

     All subsequent turns: Play reactive to what he deploys, scan him every turn, and maximize your usage of Mobilization Points.

     Reasons for cards: A Dangerous Time: All Manip decks should play this card. Its very effective if you know what the opponent will pick up, and you can maximize it if you Monnok away his doubles.

     Monnok: Bring his hand down to eight, then scan. Also gets rid of X-wing swarms, Chadra-Fans, Snowspeeders, the list goes on.

     Alter: Use it on Goo Nee Tay, if applicable. Also, its Alter! Who cares about the 2 force loss, its your choice if its worth it or not!

     Sense: See alter, also it can cancel Shocking Information and anything else that annoys you.

     Miiyoom: Please, just look her up.

     Ephant Mon: Protects Miiyoom from beatdowns by undercover spies.

     Matchups: EBO: If its X-wing swarm, use Monnoks. If its power ships (H1, Millennium Falcon, RS1), scan away his guys. Even better, scan his guys before they set up EBO.

     TIGIH: Scan his Eloms, Speeders, and whatever may be. Not too difficult.

     Hidden Base: Pretty tough, but play smart and you can prevail. Do beatdowns if he doenst suspect it.

     Agents: Monnok! This card will work wonders, and can even win you the game.

     WYS: Scan their main guys, RFCs can be a prob though. Try to control Kessel.

     Anything else: Havent tried much else, just play smart and you can win.
