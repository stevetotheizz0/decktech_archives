Strategy: '

     ***UPDATE*** Goo Nee Tay cannot hurt this deck too much. I have four Alters and enough people to use them. I can always use M’iiyoom’s text. If they use Shocking Information, I can use one of my four Senses. That is why I have four Senses and Alters
     Strategy This deck idea was taken from various Manipulation/Miiyoom decks out there on DeckTech. First and foremost, I would like to give credit to those people for providing me with such a cool deck idea.

     This deck plays for a non-flip of the objective, and uses it for activation purposes only. This deck can activate so much by turn two, its just incredible. First turn, pull Rendili, activate your five, then pull the Docking Control Room 327. Put somebody there (Miiyoom if you have her), pull ALL of your Docking Bays, and draw up for Miiyoom if you dont have her already. 

     Turn two, activate your 10-11 or whatever force, scan with Miiyoom, pull the War Room from reserve, then put guys at multiple docking bays for more activation. 

     All subsequent turns Play reactive to what he deploys, scan him every turn, and maximize your usage of Mobilization Points.

     Reasons for cards A Dangerous Time All Manip decks should play this card. Its very effective if you know what the opponent will pick up, and you can maximize it if you Monnok away his doubles.

     Monnok Bring his hand down to eight, then scan. Also gets rid of X-wing swarms, Chadra-Fans, Snowspeeders, the list goes on.

     Alter Use it on Goo Nee Tay, if applicable. Also, its Alter Who cares about the 2 force loss, its your choice if its worth it or not

     Sense See alter, also it can cancel Shocking Information and anything else that annoys you.

     Miiyoom Please, just look her up.

     Ephant Mon Protects Miiyoom from beatdowns by undercover spies.

     Matchups EBO If its X-wing swarm, use Monnoks. If its power ships (H1, Millennium Falcon, RS1), scan away his guys. Even better, scan his guys before they set up EBO.

     TIGIH Scan his Eloms, Speeders, and whatever may be. Not too difficult.

     Hidden Base Pretty tough, but play smart and you can prevail. Do beatdowns if he doenst suspect it.

     Agents Monnok This card will work wonders, and can even win you the game.

     WYS Scan their main guys, RFCs can be a prob though. Try to control Kessel.

     Anything else Havent tried much else, just play smart and you can win.  '
