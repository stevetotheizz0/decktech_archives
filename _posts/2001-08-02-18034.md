       Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi/Their Fire Has Gone Out Of The Universe 

'

Strategy: '

Ok here’s a deck inspired by Mike Hawley who conviced me that Hunt Down is indeed not dead, but yet still the best objective ever made.


Here’s what the deck does, I set up on an Endor site with Vader and his pals, and use Janus to set up everything I need.  Janus is a god and should be respected as such, his greatness is akin to only Harc Seff’s and the Naked Droid’s.  Well anyways it just controls the game with it’s high powered characters and such because they are just totally dominating.  Always start Crush, YCHF and No Escape.


Here’s some explanation of card choices for you all


Locations I play plenty for draining and a few safe twixes to increase activation.


Characters Bewil is the techest card against QMC and there is nothing like a good beatdown against that deck.  Darth Maul is killer against WYS.  Guri is a machine, literally and figuratively.  U-3PO is even more of a machine than Guri, and if you are not playing him you are on crack, there is nothing more useful than him.


Vehicle It’s just like a really big character that can hide weaker characters and can’t be hit by weapons


Starships These were well thought out, all have high immunity but Degar in punishing one, but he is the best most underused starship in existance, look at him, he screws every light decks space package right now, all rely on immunity to stay alive.  and he totally kills swarm, he’s just an awesome card.  and the stinger is so economical it’s great.


Interrupts Endor occupation is tech in this deck.  Most interrupts are self-explanatory and for battling purposes.


Effects  These are personal preferences and pretty standard.  Security precautions is the best activation card, destiny 5, can’t be drained for extra etc. and also has great game text if you do in fact go up against hb.


Weapons They’re lightsabers, what do i have to say about them.
