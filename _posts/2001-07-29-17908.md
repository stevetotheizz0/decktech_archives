Strategy: '

UPDATE Take out Oo-ta Goo-ta, Solo? and Captain Gilad Pellaeon.  It was brought to my attention that Oo-Ta is useless with IAO, though it still helps against WYS (to cancel Kessel Run), its not needed.  Replace those 2 with another Echo Command Center and Twi-lek Advisor to help get the ROC/MAIH combo gonig.




Im assuming everyone reading this knows the strategy of Responsibility Of Command, Much Anger In Him, and the Echo Command Center. I put in an Oo-ta Goo-ta Solo? in case they tried using Nabrun Leids to get there. 


The reason I have 4 Darth Vader With Lightsabers (instead of other versions) is because with dueling I will always want him to have a lightsaber, its a lot easier than drawing Vader and his lightsaber. And it cant be stolen. And since I have 4, usually it wont matter if one is killed, I can always deploy another. 


The effect I start with using Start Your Engines is obviously Wattos Box. With 3 Podracer Collisions its safe to assume Im going to win the podrace, especially with the high destiny of this deck. 


Mara Jade and Prince Xizor are just in there for support.  Myn Kyneugh, too, but hes also in because he has good destiny.


I have 2 Twilek Advisors because theres a lot of effects I need to get out. I dont think HoloNet Transmission needs any explanation in a Hunt Down deck. Put All Sections On Alert helps me defend the Holotheatre. 


Im using Sullust as my only system because it gives me good Force and a good Force drain. With my ships I think I can easily maintain control of it. 


I dont need There Is No Try because everyone I play against uses Do Or Do Not.  So I also dont need Senses and Alters.


You Cannont Hide Forever defeats numbers decks and also helps me hit opponents Jedis, making them defense value -1.  '
