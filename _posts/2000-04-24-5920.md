Strategy: '

The primary focus of this deck is ground battles. It can get down mains and aliens down quickly to set up drains. The aliens are used to get around a possible Bad Feeling Have I start. Melas and Boshek can help get around Zuckuss in Mist Hunter or be used on the ground. The spies are useful versus Hunt Down, to drop a surprise hit squad, and late game to set up some drains at unprotected 2/0 locations.

My ISP is having problems. I keep losing connection. I will finish the rest of this in depth strategy section tommorrow pnce I get it resolved. Thanks for your patience.  '
