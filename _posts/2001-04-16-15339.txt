Strategy: '

Hi, well I made this deck because almost no one execpts it. And when I see the look on their faces when I drop kabe at the audience chamber is priceless.
Here’s how to play
BHBM is a breeze, give em’ LS, RS earily and start dealing damage to them, but other wise pull Bo Shuda, drop Kabe and some other chump and give your Fan’s a power bonus. This deck pummels all type of ground decks execpt two Court and MKOS.  Because the dark side is much MUCH faster to get to the audience chamber, cancel Bo Shuda and thats it. But HDADTJ/TFHGOITU is dead to this deck beause of the OOC/TT and the 29 characters (three jedi that can sit at a battle ground and just laugh).  Force generation is great, first turn you get 5 force, next turn you get 8, next turn 11 plus what ever you get in your starting hand.  Sandwhirls are a great suprise, just don’t catch some of your better characters in one -).  Fan’s and Kabe can steal weapons so a well (very well) tracked site can steal Mara’s happy little beating toy, or Vaders stick, or is snoova bothering you? Thank you for that vibro axe I’ll draw a three.

other wise, ahev fun, it’s only a GAME
