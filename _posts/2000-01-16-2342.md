Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi/Their Fire Has Gone Out Of The Universe

'

Strategy: '

Start Hunt down stuff, and twilek, for crush the rebellion.

Against mains

This will be an easy game. Get vader out ASAP to keep the presure on. Expect him to be killed, but try to set up a healthy drain on CC with jodo. They will die due to all the visage and drains. Make a big battle happen if needed.

Against HB

This should be an easy game. Search for Security Precautions and Search and Destroy to make them come to the ground and flip. Probe, beat down on whatever they deploy. Drain more than them. After you probe, block there big drains.

Against Ops

Try to get first strike. Vader and stick at the farm 1st turn is TECH. Try to get mara down too. Beat the $%#@ out of anything they deploy. Beat them out of space.

Additions I think are needed

Those Rebels Wont Escape Us (FIXED SEE EDIT)
Bad Feeling Have I
maybe run the AC to get mara quicker.

Thanks,

Michael 'Troop1023' Kessling

****EDIT*******
I took out the two tortures. Add in resistance and Those Rebels wont escape us. '
