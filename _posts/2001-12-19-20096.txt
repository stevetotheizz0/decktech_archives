This may look like a crappy deck at first because there are no mains, no Maul, etc.  The thing is with this deck is that they are NOT NEEDED  Maul is supposed to be the jedi killers, the droids are the jedi killers  

Ok, setting up the deck, standard Dark Deal, I start with the Incinerator because its text is god-like.  ”If you control, use 2 force to retireve a droid.”  It might as well just say character instead of droid, since a majority of the characters in this deck are droids.  

Now, you may be asking, Why battle droids?  Why not just straight-up mains and toys?  Well, as much as I like M&T (the deck idea, not the bank), battle droids have some pretty good helper cards (Interrupts and Effects) that some people will not expect.  First, is Droid Racks.  The Bacta Tank of battle droids, this efefct (which is immune to Alter) can hold ANY NUMBER of battle droids lost from the table and, provided I can pay the cost, can get put back into my hand and back on the table.  Then, theres the old card, Forced Servitude.  Whenever you lose a droid from your hand or Life Force, it satisfies force loss up to its forfiet value.  WOW.  Imagine a battle in which you have to lose 6 force.  Ok, lose 2 droids from your hand, then retrieve them over 2 turns with the Incinerator.  Sick.  

Then there are the destroyer droids.  These guys got a good boost in Theed Palace, which includes the cards Rolling Rolling Rolling (The Undertakers Theme for the WWF fanz out there) and Master, Destroyers  But these are just little things when you lok at the droids themselves.  They just dominate (provided you save 1 force to use their weapon.)  

Then, there are the Blaster Rifles.  Well, destiny 6 should be reason enough to put some in the deck.  If not, Inconsequential Losses should convince you.  It allows you to forfeit weapons from a site (forfeit=3) and send them to the used pile.  Hmmmm, a destiny 6 back into the deck, dont have to forfeit a droid... not bad for something thats not M&T.  

The rest of the card choices should be easy to see why, if not, Ill explain some of the cards that arent so obvious... 
Dioxis, the nerve-gas card  Keep Jedi away  
The Bridge  I know this card cant be pulled right away, but the benefit if too good to pass up (Presence droids are power +1).  Gee, how many of those are there in the deck?  

Strategies against certain decks  
Lightsaber combat get DD set up first, drain them quick, stay off of Naboo, since you have no Dark Jedi and anyone going to Naboo will just get the middle finger from the Jedi there.
Hidden Base Occupation, if not, get all the sites and get a drain of 3 through.  But, main weapon is occupation.  
QMC Battle for Cloud city.  Beat down  
RST Beat them before they beat you, in other words, get set up first, and there shouldnt be a problem.  
WYS Get out the shield, get set up, then either go to them or go to their systems (Kessel or Tatooine)
Training Once again, Occupation is your friend.  

Comments welcome.
