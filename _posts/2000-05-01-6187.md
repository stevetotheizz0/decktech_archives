Strategy: '

basically my thing was getting the obj flipped and draining for 3 at a bg
site with sabers.  this workd well except for one game when i couldnt get a bg site out
because i couldnt pull coruscant against a dagobah deck so i couldnt get my dbay out
this deck needs REACTOR TERMINAL and some different sites so dont mention those
but duelling is good in this i have a pretty good destiny average and you just have to do what
you have to do

Against Profit
Start with Jodo and mara, starting with them gives a huge advantage dont chicken out
and not start anyone.  you know youre going to get a vader soon and then they're all done

Against HB
just play your own game and flip the obj dont woryr about draining if you cant do it. start sec prec
instead of bad feeling play battle order so they come down at you and you wreck em.  also try and probe a little
bit with the bh ships. watch out for the xwing cannons

Against Throne room
POTF one of those sites before they can nudj it get guys down tehre to sstart draining, even if they revo you can
drain for a couple and watch out for the epp hit squad duel as much as you can

Against Speeder ops
try and drain out on a BG site and get to space and start draining cause itll
be a drain race make sure your obj is flipped use the walkers to take out some speeders

thats pretty much all there is to it just get to duelling
and flip the obj.  throw in a reactor terminal im giong to but i wanted to
keep the deck true to the state tourney from saturday
thanks
