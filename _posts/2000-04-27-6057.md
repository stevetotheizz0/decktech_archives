Strategy: '

Well, this deck flip the objective by blowing up the bunker.

To start signal for Goo Nee Tay or if SAC is big go with Do, Or Do Not.

Now here's the tech.  It Can Wait & Yoda's Stew gets you the force and the power to keep the bunker clear so you can do that nice 8 damage.

The character base is very strong, using the endor persona's of han and chewie are for recycling chewie and han being immune < 4 plus his nice 'tarkin' ability.

The ships are the best the LS can muster without swarm so can give a good challenge to the DS decks.

So really look at this deck...it has battle power and completes the objective.	No numbers protection because I don't see it in my area but you can easily sub it into the deck.  Also you may question dueling protection being zero.  Well for starters I just let the DS try to duel me.  I'll wait till they play vader then just drop obi elsewhere.  I don't mind if we both lose from visage.

For against ops the dresselian commandos are nearly gods.

For blowing away the bunker you can nicely use throw me another charge and grab explosive charges or add to your destiny.  Plus it's a cycling 6 that stops the big trooper swarm also.

After the bunker goes boom then what?  Well it's mains and stuff hold out and drain on endor...and in space with the "fleet".

Remember if the DS really plays to hold the bunker let them.  Just go drain away on endor and beatdown on their other hold outs.

Thanks for looking.
