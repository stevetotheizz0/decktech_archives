Strategy: '

  Your first objective with this deck is to get Madine into the Home One Docking Bay on your first turn so you can start pulling most of the characters out of your deck.  I will usually pull out Chewie first turn, deploy him to the Endor docking bay with Luke, then deploy Wuta from the reserve deck 2nd turn and start pulling out locations.  You can feel pretty safe at the docking bays and the back door with 3 fallen portals, not to mention the Its a Trap and the Houjix combo Card to stop any kind of beatdown.  Transit Madine to Endor as soon as you have enough activation to avoid the Mara Beatdown.  


  Late in the game, transit one of your mains with some support to the CC docking bay and start using your Off the Edges for some easy retreival.


  The main purpose is to win battles.  In the 8 games that I have played this deck against a Vader, he has been turned 7 times.  The one time he wasnt was because the opportunity for a huge beatdown was there, and I took it.  With the outrageous destinies in this deck, it has proven time and time again that it can battle with the best dark decks out there.  



  Here are some explanations on some of my card choices for those of you who arent familiar with the scouts and such


Endor Rebel Landing Site  All rebels are deploy -1 there


Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight  My early numbers protection.  Ive played this deck starting with Rebel Scout and the only advantage it has is the immunity to ATWYS.  


Corporal Kensaric  Built in Goo Ney Tay


Wuta Pulls out all your Endor sites for you


Corporal Midge  The absolute BOMB  He adds to your force drains on Endor where you have a scout with ability >3 (Luke, General Solo, Orimaarko)


Wicket  Excludes characters present from Battle if you draw greater than opponents characters ability.  Very easy to do with this deck.


Arconas  Just because they are a great pain in the butt.  Only use them if you have one of your escape cards in hand.  (Houjix, It’s a Trap) Works wonders with OTE. 


Insurtion Planning  The key to the deck.  Subtracts 3 from opponents total battle destiny.  Insures that youll win any close battle.  


Why old fasion OOC and not the combo card?  Because I use the 2 scout/spies to cancel Visage and Im too stingy to pay a force to use OOC.


Fallen Portal 1 word.....BROKEN


What do I do against grabbers?  Hey, they have to chose what do grab, and theres a lot to chose from. 


No Sence/Alter protection?  Just play smarter than your opponent.  Make them use them on things you dont care about to insure that the fallen portals and insurtion plannings get through.  OOC is always good bait.  


  Now to some strategies against certain deck types.


Hunt Down  Use your spies to cancel Visage and drain him at his own Holotheatre.  Let Vader capture Luke and set up your drains at the other Endor Locations getting Midge out ASAP.  Dont forget that you can use Fallen Portal at the Back Door.  Most people seem to think that it can only be used at Docking Bays. Start dueling when youve won 3 battles.  If you win 4 battles, Game Over.  


BHBM Auto Win.  If they want to duel, youll win 99% of the time.  Pick and choose your battles and bide your time.  Same concept as playing against Hunt Down.  Leave Vader on the table (unless there is an opportunity for a HUGE beatdown) and win the game by crossing Vader.  If the opportunity presents itself to knock off the Emperor with a spy and your EPPs...Do it.  


Monkey Ties  Set up your drains with Midge on Endor ASAP and dig for I hope Shes Alright.  Youve got the drain potential for 9 per turn plus IHSA every draw phase.  When youve got some good destines set up, unleash the Counter Assault.  Ive proven with this deck that it doesnt need space.  Its 2-0 against 2 different Tie decks.  (won by 18 and 26)


MKOS  Stay away from Tatooine and make them come to you.  Once they do, drop some doors on them.  If they are not playing with Bib Fortuna, use the Arconas to block their drains.  But only do this when you get the Houjix in hand.  A timely Bubo could prove fatal.  You have to play smart.  They will get some retrieval, but if you play it right, this deck will win the drain race.  Also remember that you can drop a door on them at Jabbas Palace if the opportunity presents itself.  Against one MKOS deck that I played against, at the end of the game he had 7 cards stacked on I feel the Conflict.  


  Ive only lost with this deck once in 4 tournaments so far. (timed loss 17-14)  It doesnt look like it has much power to it, but it just keeps on winning those battles and crossing Vader over to the good guys.  This deck is not for a beginner.  It takes some skillz to play it.  And like I said, the best thing about it is.......ITS NOT WYS OR HB MAINS


  Editors Note 3/29/01  Battle Order is not a worry at all.  This deck activates upwards of 15 all by itself.  There is no need for space because any true dark space deck will have the means to obliterate anything that I put up there.  Its just much better to stay away from that.  Ephont Mon at the Holotheatre?  Who cares....there are so many characters in this deck that you can just deploy a spy to the Med Chamber and gradually build it up with characters and move over. (except the spy and a bodyguard of course) If a Hunt down player is using this tactic, its because they really dont have the resourses to protect Visage any other way.  


You are able to pull almost everything you will need with Madine, Insurection, and Wuta.  With your starting 10 cards on the table, and you start pulling the locations and scouts out you are left outrageous destinies. There are 17 cards in the deck that are destiny 5 or 6.    


Editors Note 3/31/01  If you don’t like the arcona’s, there are plenty of other scouts that you can try.  Admittingly, they hit the lost pile more times than not, but when your able to use them, they are a great asset. (A seasoned player will know when to, and when not to use them)  One suggestion that I actually liked, was to replace the 2 Arcona’s for a Bacta Tank and Ounee Ta.  Use those 2 slots to fit your own personal playing style.
