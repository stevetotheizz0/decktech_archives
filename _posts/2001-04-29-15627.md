Strategy: '

Hmm, i wont go in to detail how you gotta play against certain deck types. Just a basic strategy of how you setup your game


Starting stuff is Mob Points / IAO / OppEnforcement


Before the game starts, pull Wakeelmui with MobPoints. Pull out Palpy, Force Lightning, Emperors Power and the 2 Docking Bays to get some activation going. If they havent started with Your insight...(which is common in WYS decks) go for the early insert...Back Palpy up with Tech Mor and Onith and get a total of 15...dont forget about onith ability to scan your opp. hand and get rid of some of their mains and supporting cast. Move Paly over to his Throne Room to get the benefits from Emperors Power. If they do start with Your insight.. go for the systems and set up some nice drains...use your twileks to fish for Sienar Fleet Systems..do not deploy the ”numbers” characters and wait if they drop Your insight for battle plan..if they do hit him with inserts...


Some cards explained


Sense/uncertain is the future great card to change your hand...and with palpy out, try to sense some key interrupts in the early game (before they flip WYS)


DV with Stick i only use him for suicide runs against some lone characters...or go and capture luke and sit at the E Docking Bay...


Emperors Shield / Sword deploy as react..even to the D*2 docking bay...nuff said..


Thats all...hope you enjoy this one...
