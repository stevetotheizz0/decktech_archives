Strategy
This deck is very easy to play. Just start with ISB, Coruscant and Imperial Arrest Order. Pull either Yavin 4 or Hoth docking bays first. Just save up force. Put a couple cheap ISBs there, and by turn 3, you can flip the objective. Keep pulling docking bays with IAO and dropping ISBs like mad. Play some mains and high-stats guys to back up your relatively weak ISBs. Stick Mara and her glowstick at Back Door or Cantina for a drain of 3, 4 with an ISB there. Use the Undercovers for blocking a big drain. There Is No Try keeps your red cards safe. The bounty hunter ships will keep space pretty well covered for additional drains. Make sure to leave a couple sites with only spies that look pretty 'weak' to your opponent. When the beatdown comes, drop Sneak Attack. Boom, instant power or battle destiny at least +3 or +4 Stick Chall at Cantina or Docking Bay 94, and pull the one ORS if it's not already out. There's only one for fear of Grimmy, and plus I only have one. Watch out for MWYHL, though, it can hurt you. Broken Concentration should be a great help, though. Good Luck, and May The Force Be With You.

UPDATE I added in Imperial Decree to slow LS drains. An extra Spaceport Docking bay helps to counter Hidden Base. I needed some power to hold down systems, so the mighty Executor took the place of the ICSD. The Snowtrooper Officer was too expensive, so I took one out. The average deploy is very low because if you don't get out the sites other than docking bays, you wont be acitvating all that much. Also, I was having trouble getting out Undercovers to block heavy drains, so I added an extra.

UPDATE 2
I took out the probe droids in favor of 2 more ORSs. Gravity Shadow gave way to Vader's Saber for cutting up stuff and to enhance the relatively small drains. DVDLOTS replaced EPP, and ECC IG-88 replaced EJP IG-88 to up my ground power. Vader's Personal Shuttle was put in to lower the average deploy for my starships, it was really high. Security Precautions went in for Reactor Terminal; I needed better HB counters. Overall, this deck is now much more balanced deck.

UPDATE 3
Took out 2 ORS's.   They were getting Grimmy'ed away, so I put in 2 other ISBs.  Added in Blizzard 2 and Tempest 1 to protect puny ISBs from getting shot/chopped/blown up, etc.   Some ships came out; there were too many.	Added in PotF to bump up drains, and CHYBC for general purposes.  No Ghhhk's because I wont be droppin' n' drainin'.
