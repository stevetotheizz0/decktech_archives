Strategy: '

	in this deck I try to set up early and just 

out flow jawa’s(deploy 0 when tessek at audience 

chamber and power 3 when kalits there and up to 

forfeit 8) and palace raiders from my hand. 

I usually surprise my opponent with the power

 of the jawas in early battles which usualy hearts

 thier forces. if they don’t attack i set up massive

drains.(i can drain for 6 at jundland wastes while

tessek at chamber, crell on table and vaperator

and hydro station there). I use OTE to chase my 

opponent out of the audience chamber and for 

general purposes. in some battles i can have 4 BD’s

and 1 to power therefore handing out loads of 

attrition and chasing my opponent. this deck has a

good 5-1 record at tournaments and always beats my 

friends. I don’t use sandwhirl because it would 

cause trouble for my non jawa’s and i choose to have

more useful sites. when i am playiny I stick to 

the same plan of drainig and cancelling my 

opponents unless there is a cause for me to raid 

them.

	plese give me an idea for another starting 

interrupt and plese review

	THANKS FOR READING 

beware of the jawa’s    '
