Strategy: '

This Deck is very versitile. It is excellent on the ground. Fallen Portal definately helps. Docking Bay&#8217;s rule... also, its surprisingly well in space. should i throw in another super duper falcon? i was thinking about home one. i dunno.. gimmie ideas. i&#8217;ll add more on the strategy later.
