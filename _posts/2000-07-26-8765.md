Strategy: '

Okay this deck is NICE This deck is well rounded, to face most decks.

Basics
Use the Quarrens to bring out the Royal Gaurds as a beat down force. The Disruptor Pistols and Force Pikes work very well together. Kudos to Garret for this Idea
CROSS LUKE OVER It's not that hard to set up.

VS. Numbers...as you see there are no anti numbers cards in the deck...except for royal gaurds and palpy. Just don't drop Vaders and such and they can't do anything.

VS. Profit...This is a bit harder. Deploy in force. Don't depend on leaveing Vader alone with tarkin...He'll get whupped...Again Thanks to Garret.;)

VS. Operatives...Laugh...Leave them to me+vader/Tarkin+Guards=Operatives Stink.

VS. Training Get Vader out so they lose to Your Destiny, and try to set up a number of drains (for 1). This tends to be a longer game, but Your destiny usually wins out.

Thanks for looking'
