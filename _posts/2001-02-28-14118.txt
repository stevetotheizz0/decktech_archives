Strategy: 

Well, before you all go and slam the deck, let
me just say that I’m entering it here mainly
so I can access it myself in the future. I’ve
played this deck through 5 or 6 tournaments and
for numerous other fun games. There have been a
couple of minor tweaks here and there, but the
deck has been, for the most part, unchanged
throughout. It has an excellent track record,
but, more importantly, it’s fun to play, and
that’s why I’m posting it here before I tear it
apart to build new decks.

I built this after I went 1-2 with a Jedi
Training deck at a tournament (obviously, that
wasn’t going to cut it) and decided that I was
done with Jedi Training for a long time. I then
reflected upon what it was that made Jedi
Training so much fun for me (when it worked
well), and I came up with the following answers:
1) It shuts down drain bonuses, 2) It sets up
a permanent high destiny, and 3) I get to
retrieve force. Well, apart from the
cancellation of drain bonuses, this deck does
the same thing... only faster. And at the speed
this deck moves, it cancels drains by killing
the characters your opponent can use to drain.

Take a look at the destiny of this deck. After
the 10 starting cards (start Wise Advice instead
of Staging Areas if you suspect SAC), you will
have 23 cards at 5 destiny or higher, 14 of
which are 6 or higher. Nothing ought to be
immune to your battle destinies.

There are two basic game plans, and they work
as follows. The first game plan takes effect if
your opponent captures Luke with Vader; win 3
battles or duels, and turn him to the light
side. In the second game plan (mainly against
Scum or Ties), set up your Mega-Activation and
Mega-Destiny to cause Mega-Attrition with beat-
down squads that whup your opponents and control
locations. (However, be careful of Ties with
Lasers.) In the second game plan, Rebel Scout
Luke is monster. Immune to Always Thinking With
Your Stomach, he’s a drain of 2 on the second
turn and activating 5 at the Landing Platform.
If your opponent tries to battle Luke, a Fallen
Portal can take out 2 characters, a Clash can
take out another, Swing and Chop a 3rd, and kill
their destiny with Insertion Planning. Luke
lives. Kills Scum Dead.

Match-ups for the Masses:

Vs BHBM.
A very strategic game. You’re giving them Luke
right away, so this kills your activation for
a couple of turns. Eat the force loss, and save
for strategic battles. Try not to grin if your
opponent considers dueling. Move Vader to the
Throne Room (oops! no more Vader). Try not to
look at Vader too much to indicate that you’re
about to kick his @rse with Obi w/Saber, random
spy, and Chewbacca, etc... Get 3 on I Feel the
Conflict, turn Vader.

Vs Scum.
Thank your opponent for the activation. Use your
<> DB judiciously. Control the sites he wants to
control. I wanted to fit Aim High in the deck,
but the destiny sucks. Solo with Chewie (or a
scout at an exterior stie) will take care of
their destiny. Use Insertion Planning and Fallen
Portal. On the Edges will keep retrieval even.
You have better destiny and will cause them to
forfeit everything every battle. Luke will drain
like a monster for 3 every turn at the Back Door.
Battle Plan could be used if you get early air
supremecy. (Watch out for the Rancor; don’t
deploy to the Rancor pit to attack it, you might
just draw bad destiny--see "Scrubbing Out
Hardcore" in my tourney reports for more info...)

Vs Ties.
One of the (non-tournament) losses I suffered
was to Ravelling’s Tie deck because I played
like a monkey. My advice: don’t play like a
monkey. Get Battle Plan out at the first
opportunity and turn the game into a drain
race. Their early drain cancellation will be
a pain, but who cares? Eventually they will
deploy all their Ties, and you will *still* be
retrieving your On the Edges. You get much
more force early on, and this is the one real
chance you have to use Shocking Info for that
other ability--you know, the one that cancels
a scomp link... That’s right, Mr. Merrejk!
Wait to go into space until you’ve determined
that they don’t have those nasty lasers, or
that they’re starting to get low on force.

Vs Hunt Down.
Make them lose a couple Vaders with Han/Chewie,
Wedge/Corran Horn, Blount/Cracken, and stack
cards at the same time. Don’t deploy Obi
against Vader if your opponent has been 
tracking dueling destiny or if you’re unsure
if he has a dueling destiny-adder in his hand.
Deploy Obi where Vader can’t reach him, or
wait until you’ve gotten a favorable peek at
his destiny. You’re going to suffer early
force loss, again, against a Hunt Down deck,
but attrition and On the Edge will wear them
out later on.

Vs Stupid Decks.
Use Insight and Battle Plan and On the Edge to
beat stupid decks. Use Luke w/Saber if they’re
playing a stupid deck without Imperials. You’ve
got Blount if they’ve got a stupid deck that
has ISB in its Lore.

Remember, Star Wars CCG can be fun. Enjoy.
