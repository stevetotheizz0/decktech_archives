Strategy: '

First Off, this is just a deck i was tinkering with before tatooine, so if i left something out that is important, tell me.

Anyway first turn i use JP AC game text to get out Mara Jade and Deploy others with whatever force i have left. I wait 3 or 4 turns ( to where i have enough force to actually retrieve) to start a podrace. I then just capture my opponents unlucky Characters and let my Sarlacc have a treat.


Against

RST If they don’t wanna come to AC, fine, 1 force loss a turn. put Ephant Mon at Bunker and build up at back door.

QMC go to Cloud City, Drain and capture someone to take back to tatooine.

WYS I HATE WYS decks. But I’ll load up in the Cantina, and get one of my bounty hunters to capture someone and feed ’em to the Sarlacc. '
