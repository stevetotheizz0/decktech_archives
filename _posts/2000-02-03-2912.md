Objective
Hidden Base '

Strategy: '

Start Haven on Rendezvous Point so you can deploy cheaply. Most of the ships are ability 2 permanent pilots so putting 2 to a system will give you a batte destiny (unless Zuckuss in Mist Hunter is there) and on Kiffex this will be a power +2 also. Legendary Starfighter can deal force loss if you destroy one of their starfighters. Battle Plan is to battle draining decks and there's alot of ability 4 guys in there. There are two reasons for that, one is that they give you an automatic battle destiny, and two is that they will give you retrieval if you play Our Most Desperate Hour. It Could Be Worse is if they probe you with Security Precautions out. The corvettes all have high forfeit so Savrip will help and Bacta Tank will help you with your limited amount of characters. '
