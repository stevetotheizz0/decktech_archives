Strategy: 

The basic idea of this deck is to get Dark Deal down on turn 2 or 3. Lots of locations are so your
sure you get the force you need to get DD quickly. Most of the characters are relatively cheap and
have some particular reason for being in. SDs are for just in case opponent has a light starfighter or 2
sitting alone at a system draining. Cloud stuff is to make sure you control Bespin:CC for the start.
Saber is for Djas Puhr. TD for the hunters [TDs are fun against a bunch of mains piled up at one site
=)], Undercover and spies to lure opponent to CC. Furry Fury against Han+Life Debt.
