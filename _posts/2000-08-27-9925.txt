Deck Strategy

Ok, you have seen a deck like this before, but this has a few changes.	This deck plays like all the other deck, get Luke to your opponent and make them loose some force.  You have enough for some space drains and some ground drains.

Vs. RAL-Ops -Start the same and go beet them down with your Eloms.  Get a docking bay to Ral and Home One Docking Bay.	Deploy Rebels to HO Docking bay and move over for free.  Drain on the ground and in the air.  Dont forget to use your retrieval.

Vs. Court- Force drain and destroy them.  You should be able to win you have lots of power.  Good luck.

Vs. Space- You should be able to win a few space battles and force drain them in the Cantina.  Force drain and retrieve until you win.
This deck seems to work really well, I have only used it with my friends, no turnies.  But when I played it, it won by about 25.  This deck is great.  I would like any advice you could give me.

Good Luck and My the Force be With You
