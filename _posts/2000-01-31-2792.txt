Strategy: 

As you can see, this will rip Profit decks a new one.

**CHANGES IN NEXT SECTION**
I made some changes in just about everywhere.  I took out the Cave for more room. Bubo is out for better stuff since mains are the standard at the moment and Bubo won't take 'em out.  I took out the Tortures for another Twi'lek and Resistance.	I added Monnok, Ghhhk, and Masterful Move for versatility.  I added Wuher for anti-Artoo/Gift.	I took out some characters.  Imperial Decree, Ephant Mon, and Veers are out.

There is a lot of options for this deck.  Against big drainers (Ops, QMC) go with your Walkers to exterior sites and character combos to interior.  Kick'em down wherever they leave themselves remotely open and slowly move toward victory.	Drain for everything you're worth, and Occupation should take care of the rest.

Hidden Base shouldn't be a problem, since you have SecPrecautions and Occupation plus lots of characters and ships, and SAC takes out a lot.

MWYHL could be tough, the best thing to do is to not leave yourself open to anything, keep enough power at sites to prevent beatdowns, and let Occupation do the work.	Most MWYHL won't have a lot of space (save those weird swarms) so you can keep Tatooine pretty easily.
**Now back to my previous strategy**


If you face a Profit deck, your two aliens should be Mara and Jabba, so that if they start Scramble you should have a destiny, unless they play clash too, but that probably won't hurt and you'll see why.

You start with Tatooine, Combat Readiness, and Jabba's Palace normally. First turn search for the AC, and Profit is now activating 4 force. Ouch. There is another possibility, though. Should the opponent be playing Tosche tech, you would probably want with CR + Mos Eisley. Against ANYTHING else though, start JP.

You have so much stuff to take down Profit it's not even funny. Sense/Alter covers a lot, kills Someone Who Loves You, and is just the good all-purpose stuff. Walkers for intense power, and BH starships for taking out that Falcon. Good-bye Han!

Characters- Your characters are all quite versatile as pilots and killers. If playing against a Profit deck, your immediate option is to deploy an alien from reserve once you get AC out. I would suggest either Boelo or, since he kicks with Jabba. ECC and EJP really have a presence in this deck, I'm using almost everybody except the new Dengar and Bossk.

Ships/Vehicles-- basically they are your blue presence. HB can't survive with all that stuff you're doing to them, plus Occupation loss. Suicide mains won't even make a dent I think. Security precautions for back up. Vehicles are your standard for Tatooine assault. Brangus, Veers and Igar are your standard pilots (B also works well at the cantina and in space), but Ozzel, Tarkin, and others are good too.

Interrupts- ouch, nothing immune to sense, save Ghhhk... But my own SA makes up for it. No Evaders since Revo isn't prominent and that would not be the focus anyway of a TR deck. Have some Elis beatdown and another Twi'lek for pulls.

Effects- brought them down to bare minimum. You have Occupation, BO, SecPre, Resistance, Secret Plans, and H2Pay, use them wisely-- they are your tech stuff.

This deck has lots of power, and I would especially recommend it if Profit decks are popular in your area.  Also see Matt Lush's Old-Skool Tatooine Beatdown, which is similar but has some neat quirks.
