Strategy: 

Put your mains down on cloud city and all ships in the air and start draining. I like to put a Yt-1300, a RFC, and a X-Wing at every system (then you'll have power 7 and a draw and I have many tricks up my sleeve for more draws). Combo: SoS, Anikans Lightsaber, on Lower Corridor and you'll have power 7, drain for 4 and can wack guys that come there. I have 3 Kessel Runs , and 3 RFC to make trips when needed.
