I’ll Take the Leader x2 

Strategy: 

@@@@: Read Berfore Reviewing: Switch Back Door out for Tatooine. Sorry fogot to put it in. 


Basics: Pull Tatooine and Tatooine: Docking Bay, Pull any characters or starships you can with squadron assignments, Save your force ofr a turn then get a few character down to Tat: sites and Get the Celebration Going using Tunnel Vision. Add to your drains at the DBs with the sabers and Ill take the leader. Retrive everything you lose, and most importantly battle your opponent to death. 

Matchups: 

Court or MKOS: Tough Game, Take the Chamber early and beat them off their own sites and retrieve with Tat: Celebration. Make them lose tons form direct damage and Drain like mad. Kill Jabba with your crew. If they try to go to space kill them there. Watch for All Wrapped Up, but you can always free them. If you keep the pressure on the opponet will eventually fold. 

Hunt Down: Use your spies to drain at Executor sies and use TT x2 to cancel visage. Use your dueling protection when needed. . Use your mains to beat tem down and Drain and Retrieve on Tat. If they come to space destoy them and drain at coruscant and you can win the game if you play well.

BHBM: When they try to battle you desroy them. Then retrieve and Drain. Use luke on an early Suicide run Before you give him up. They proabably wont have any retreival so your retieval will waste them away. If they come to space no worries. If you use this deck to ist fullets advantage it can beat BHBM easy.

Ties: Use Ill take the leader to reduce their ties power and use it to drain for more as well. Then strike at they weakest point with all of your space power and use OTE to make them pay for it. Retrieve any force you lose and battle them if they ever try to come to the ground. Very tough, but can be done.

This deck has served me well, and I plan to take it to a local tournament this weekend.

Thanks for Reading and Reviewing.
