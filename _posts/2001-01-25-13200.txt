In response to reviews

Ok, the first draft of this deck did have the DSDB and the CCDB, however, that made it a lot harder to set up decree, as holding 2 systems with this deck wont happen very often.  Also, decree is essential for those revolution decks that still pop up every now and again.	But, I am open to changes if you think the deck will be better off.  Tell me what you think


***DISCLAIMER***

This is the first Hunt Down deck I have built in over 2 years.	Therefore, please excuse me if I cannot detail a specific matchup.

***End Disclaimer***

Ok, this deck wins by Dueling away 2 of the opponents biggest chars and beating down on the rest.  The direct damage potential is huge.

Early Game
Start off by pulling Rendili and the Executor DB and dropping someone like Janus, Sim, or the Emperor if you have him to add to your activation.  Start drawing for your vaders and setting up your destinies.	If they drop luke or Ben early, you can try a blind duel... almost half of the cards in the deck are Destiny 4 or above, but if you are going to use this tactic I recommend using focused attack to help guarantee it.

Mid Game

By now you should have at least some tracking going on, so feel free to duel whenever the chance arrives. The ever Popular masterful move/Visage/Janus trick will make sure you can hit/choke/attririon off anything your opponent throws at you.

End Game Let Visage + S&D do their thing.  Honor shouldnt be a problem between occupying 3 BGs or getting out No Escape.  By now you should be pulling 5’s, 6’s and 7’s on a VERY regular basis.  That and the drains shouldfinish your opponent off.

Reasons for adding certain cards

This is Some Rescue Pure Tech against OOC/TT, which I expect to be showing up a lot now that Ref2 is out. Protects both my Visage and my Lost Vaders, not to mention it’s a used 6, which is always good.

Shut Him up or Shut Him down another tech card.  With SAC being virtually useless, cancelers like these can definitely save the day.  In this case it cancels DSP (great agains the surrisingly powerful RTP decks starting to pop up) and Bacta tank, which can be key.

Blast Door Controls I want to fight.  Barrier and Narrow Escape dont let me fight.  They suck.  This card is good Tech.   It lets me fight.  I sound like a pakled (Trek reference)

Dominator I’m taking a page out of Yannik’s book here.  the whole Lose it, retrieve it, draw it with Janus. repeat thing is just that cool.

4-Lom w/Gun x2 This Guy cancels Ben Kenobi’s and Jedi Luke’s anti-duel text and immunity.	Enough said.

Other cards I wouldnt Mind Finding room for

another Circle and Obsession
Blizzard 2 (anti EBO/Icestorm tech)
IG88 w/Gun
Boba Fett in Slave 1
Ephant Mon
Holonet Transmission
Unexpected Interruption
another Dr. E. (And Ponda Baba too)
Projective Telepathy


Here are some matchups that come to mind

vs. HB (X-Wings or Squassin variant)
Get a BG DB if you drew a Vader in your opening hand, flip ASAP.  If Luke Comes down to play Obsess him.  Get S&D as soon as it’s viable.  You should be able to out drain/damage him if you get decree running.	Dont go to space unless you know you can do some damage, or probe and sit on a probed system to drain without worrying about Battle damage.

vs. EBO

This can be tough.  You need to keep visage running and get S&D out early.  Flip ASAP and stay flipped.  Battle whenever you get the chance, as you can outpower your opponent on the ground.  It will be hard, but try to get Decree into effect, and above all, watch out for ice storm.

vs. Mains (HB or TR start)
Grab their cycling 6’s and secret plans their retrieval.	Hunt Down should really be able to handle Mains in any flavor, just play smart.

vs. Profit
You could start Mara and Dengar in the chamber, just be sure to back them up on turn 1, ideally with vader. If they do free Han, kill him.  If ben brings him back, Duel Ben, then kill him.  Another matchup you should win

vs. TIGIH
Well you wont be duelling much this game oP just hold onto luke with Vader and keep your forces consolidated and you should do ok. if it;s the speeder variant move over to Chirpas hut for an easy drain of 2.

vs. Eloms.

Monnok them if possible, otherwise dont spread too thin and use Dr.E/PB and Dengar to fry a few furballs, drain in space.  Dont be a scrub and do something stupid.  You can win this if you play it right.

Being that I’m tired right now, Thats all the matchups I can think of.  please feel free to give this deck constructive advice, as I know it’s not perfect.  Thanks for your Time
