Strategy: 

Explaining how to properly play manipulator takes a lot of time
and space so I wont do this. The deck has a good drain potential
but you cant afford to go after the opponent with a lot of cards.
But thanks to the objective, opponent has to come to you.
The most important characters to scan away are Obi-wan first because
his nasty immunity and then everyone that holds a weapon. The other
characters shouldnt do you a lot of harm. 4 ships and sec prec is enough
against hidden base.
