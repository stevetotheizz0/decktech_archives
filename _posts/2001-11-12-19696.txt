Strategy: 

early: control a few sites, get vader/tarkin and an i have you now ready. 

mid game: deploy ships and get dark deal and occupation out. drain.

late game: if opponent is still alive, drain.

matchups:  

jedi trianing: ignore opponent and drain him to death before his training is done.

qmc: try to win battles and remove enemy threats before getting out dark deal or occupation. this will be a difficult game to win.

wys: this could bring trouble, watch for luke and keep your ships together and try to minimize losses in the air.

hidden base: another tough one. keep up a hard ground drain, although they will cancel alot of it. keep a control on bespin so they cant block as many drains.

this is a new deck, and one of my first submissions, so help me out with it.
