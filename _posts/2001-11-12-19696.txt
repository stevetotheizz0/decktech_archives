Strategy: '

early control a few sites, get vader/tarkin and an i have you now ready. 

mid game deploy ships and get dark deal and occupation out. drain.

late game if opponent is still alive, drain.

matchups  

jedi trianing ignore opponent and drain him to death before his training is done.

qmc try to win battles and remove enemy threats before getting out dark deal or occupation. this will be a difficult game to win.

wys this could bring trouble, watch for luke and keep your ships together and try to minimize losses in the air.

hidden base another tough one. keep up a hard ground drain, although they will cancel alot of it. keep a control on bespin so they cant block as many drains.

this is a new deck, and one of my first submissions, so help me out with it.  '
