Strategy: '

ok usually start IAO, its the key to this deck, you can twilek for sec precautions or whatever you need later. get ominous rumors out 1st turn.
drain in space.  use the scrubs as forfiet fodder if they play a super falcon.	the shuttles can get my guys up in space (and desane pulles them from reserve deck).
you should wate most decks, theres grabbers and everything u need.
remember -
start battle order vs ops.
everything else usually start IAO, drain in space, keep your guys at endor to get ominus rumors to work well.
