Strategy: '


-First off the slight changes from the original-

Took Out - (1)Imperial Barrier and (1)Dreadnaught
Put In - (1)4-LOM W/Concussion Rifle and (1)Point Man

The reason behind this madness is that I forgot to put 4-LOM in the deck, and well I figured I need Point Man because alot of people in my area are playing OTEs and not alot of Retrieval (if thats hot in your area take out the Point Man and put in Secret Plans)

Also this deck is now 14-0 in tournament play...wheee

Now on to the fun....

As w/most BHBM decks the first thing that you want to do is look for Rendili before you activate, that way it assures you of getting it, and it possibly not being there so that your opponent can look through your deck. Once you get that, activate (Ive seen this mistake where they deploy it and forget...whoops) then go get the Emperor (if hes there), D*IIDB (if its there) and Force Lightning (again if its there) and deploy them and Rendili. That way it guarantees you an activation of 9 min (8 if they get a spy there...yah right)
Also, once you get Janus plop him down w/the Emperor and keep them together until your about to duel and covert Luke. By then the game is pretty much allready over and youve one (if your going for the conversion) because youll have 4 or 5 stacked cards.

Keep Jabba and Boba together or Boba and IG-88, save 4-LOM for where you need him the most and you shouldnt have much of a problem.

Also don’t forget the sweet Janus/Emperor ’tech’ - get Force Lightning w/the Emepror on your turn and then put it back on the bottom of the Used and get a card...then on your opponents turn do the same thing (but don’t put it back till the end of his turn...just in case) rinse repeat wash...~smirk~

Agasint certain decks just check out my ”decktech” site and read ”Suh-WEET BHBM” for how to play against most of the deck. Their quite similiar except for a couple of cards.


Thanks for taking the time to look, and please rate this deck fairly.
