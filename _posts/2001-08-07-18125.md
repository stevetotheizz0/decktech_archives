This deck would be pretty easy to build if you have a good copying machine and a friend with a reflections II box or just a refections II box


Podracing adds a lot to a deck, you get to retrieve fore while the opponent loses force.  With I did it you force them not to save any cards. 


You use podrace prep to get out squadron assingments and all the podrace stuff. Then when you have a lot of cards in your lost ple you initate a podrace.

VS. Dark Deal

Let Me say one thing Menace Fades


VS. Agents Of The Black Sun

Well these decks are meant to play eachother and this deck will usually win


Vs. Walker Garrison

Well walker garrison decks are powerful so you try to  beat them on hoth
