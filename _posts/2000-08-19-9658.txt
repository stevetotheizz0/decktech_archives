Strategy: 

This is a deck type I've been playing for a long time. This form of it has gone 6-2 in tournament games for me. If you are curious about the losses they were to a x-wing swarm and a profit deck, both of which were played by people with much more tournament experience then myself.

How to begin the game:

secret plans and the west gallery from the objective

mobilization points(or battle order against profit), IAO, and oppressive enforcement using the starting interrupt


first turn I often use the objective to deploy bespin, then use IAO to get a 1/0 docking bay. Based on whats in your force pile and how your opponent started you can now choose to deploy to the docking bay for extra activation, play the twilek, or draw.

Always use these to search engines to determine what is in your force pile so you can decide if you want to draw.

In future turns deploy dark deal,cloud city occupation, and We're In Attack Position Now, to cause a large amount of damage. This should force the opponent onto cloud city which is a hostile environment.

The reasons you should win conflicts on your turf include deployment costs from bespin gametext, power bonuses from dark deal and cloud city, five characters which fire permanent weapons, and the interceptor cannons which have shot down every version of the falcon in tournament games.

for undercover spies I included snipers.

first strike becomes even better with secret plans. In addition I like first strike with broken concentration. Depriving the opponent of that saved force is ALWAYS worth it. Broken concentration is also overlooked as a surpise rebel barrier counter.

For those of you who will mock my use of the new executor it's destiny of 5 with MP has come up big too many times. In addition, one game I deployed it against a lone ship and battled with only 13 force left in my deck for the win. I actually like it more then the dagobah version.

Thanks for reading my strategy, I welcome any ideas for improvement.
