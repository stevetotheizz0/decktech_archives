Strategy: '

Okay, by starting with Imperial Arrest Order, you can get the Death Star Docking Bay first turn. Deploy Vader there first turn. Next turn get the Executor Docking Bay out, and move Vader there. Next turn move him to the Meditation Chamber, so you can draw destiny in space. While doing this, get the systems out and get Sienar Fleet Systems going. Retrieve and drain.  '
