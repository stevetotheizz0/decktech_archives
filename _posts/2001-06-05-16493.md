Strategy: '

edit i got 6 spys in this deck. Alter dont work for on 7 why should i worry. i got 4 ways to pull the falcon. Look it up. 




After CA state finals I decided to use this power house objective. Its a powerhouse in space and ground. I thought it was weak little objective in till I saw it, in hands of a master. Now bear with me. 

Why Some card selections 

Goo nee tay-Of the most important cards in the deck. Making maul and other important ep1 characters +2 will clear the cantina. Protect from mass beatdown anywhere. Sense and alter cant be played on 7 side, this is huge. 

Why start with signal? After first turn, I can get another effect out of my reserve deck, as I need it. 

Out of commission is huge. Taking out maul or a Vader its over. 

Weapon levitation can devastate any ground beat down force. 

Barriers are awesome, as you know. 

Hojixs combo card great for space and ground combined. Dont like to be blind-sided 

Fallen portal is devastation to docking bay mania. 

I have a bad feeling about this, come on lateral damage or death mark are eliminated. 

How did we get into this mess, great with Artoo combo. 

Nightfall is for my spies beat down anywhere. Free deployment and adds a destiny to power. Oh cool-another destiny..... 

Obi wan- come on, on tatooinie he is a man to deal with. In cantina he is a one-man machine. Only deploys for 11, so what with beggar he can take care him self. Only +6 force deployment personal 

Why no grabbers? Just dont have the space. Its not an interrupt so its useless to me so far 

Here is some idea for few turns 

First turn activate and get Kessel and deploy it. No matter what this deck will give you a great hand. Mostly a site or good characters to start. Leave the force there. Next turn activate Deploy to Kessel and cantina. Only lose interrupts to force drains. Next turn, drain and deploy nightfall (with signal from reserve deck) and rest of the spy massacre to anywhere. There fine. Its free to deploy under nightfall. Rest is up to you. 


Here is the match ups 

ISB ground or space- Lt. blunt will finish the job. Luke with lightsaber and couple of smugglers will hold cantina. Space drain at Kessel and cantina will destroy them. Fades menace will do its job. 


Hunt down and bring him before me 

Give them Luke Jedi at cantina. Then fallen portal at the docking bays to get him back and out of commission Vader, its game. Out of commission for visage 


Railter or opts- 

One turn beat-down with nightfall at there locations. They would not know what hit them. 


Maul and landing site 

Drop nightfall and take out maul. Out of commission, its game. If they decided to pod race, aim high and anakin with drains its over. For the lost of 10 in pod racing use ”it could be worse.” Also dont forget about goo nee tay.


Hoth dark side and dark deal 

Fades menace is your friend. Set it up and drain. tLose to direct damage and cancel there force drain bonuses. Honor those not help, beacause they will play with the bullet card. 


Set your course for alderan 

Destroy the gunners and be careful about Kessel. It may cost you so wait for drain to due their harm and then deploy. Aim high is good for there retrieve and I hope she is alright will get them in long run. 


Scum and villainy and aliens 

Just go after them. Myo shows her head take her out and out of commission will end her reign. 


Rest of the decks 

Just play normal and be patience. 


Please give a good review and also give me some advice about how to improve. Currently I am 15-1 with this deck. Only lost to 2000+ player with 8 and won against 1900+ players in 10 games. So its not a fluke.
