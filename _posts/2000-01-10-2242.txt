Strategy: 

Ooops, I left out Mara Jade's Lightsaber.
I only realized that when I submitted the
deck. There should be one.

As indicated already, the starting effects are
Bad Feeling Have I (against Mains), Security
Precautions (against Hidden Base), and Battle
Order (against Ops).

For those who do not know what the new Objective
does, here is the front side:
Court Of The Vile Gangster
Deploy Audience Chamber, Great Pit Of Carkoon and
Dungeon.
While this side up, once during each of your deploy
phases, may deploy one docking Bay, or independent
starship from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Bounty
Hunters are forfeit +2 and immune to Goo-Nee Tay.
You may not play Scanning Crew. Each player loses
1 Force at end of each of their deploy phases unless
that player has a non-droid character at a Tatooine
battleground site.
Flip this card if you nhave two captives (or a captive
of ability greater than two) at any Jabba's Palace site.

I did not write out the other side because this deck
does not plan to flip. If you want to know the other
side visit the Decipher website.

It is obvious that the benefits on the Front side
of the objective are huge. Force generation on
turn one is five (possibly more). You can pull
independent starships out of your reserve deck,
your bounty hunters are forfeit +2 and sre immune
to Goo Nee Tay. There is also a mini Visage. This
is huge in the early game. This deck can deploy
an ability 4 alien on turn one easily from the RD
with Audience Chamber text. This especially huge
against non interactive decks.

There are plenty of good force drain locations in
the deck (TC, JW,LMF,Cantina). Presence is to
enhance drains and Tatooine Occupation is to cause
force loss.

The characters in this deck can really lay the smack
down. With plenty of destinies and with Mara
Jade's Lightsaber and the doc, this can really crush
the light side.

The ships are really good. They can be pulled out
by the objective. You can get out all your ships
really easily and quickly. This is really important
against Hidden Base for a quick probe.

The interrupts are very important to the deck. None
Shall Pass and Imperial Barrier forms the defence
against Mains. Control can be used to cancel drains
or most importantly, cancel Sense and Alters. Sense
and Alters are a huge threat against this deck.
Main Course is huge. The LOST bit is so underestimated.
This can really kick your opponent. Torture is
my protection against numbers.

Scum and villainy forms the basis of the deck.
Combined with First Strike, this is just lethal.
I'm retrieving 3 Force a turn and he's losing 1
Force. Tatooine Occupation will make him lose
even more force. And Secret Plans will cripple
any Force Retrieval.

This is how this plays against light decks:
MAINS
This is all about battling. Retrieve some force
and cause some damage. The abilty to cancel game
text with 4-LOM and extra battle destinies will
help win the game. Tatooine Occupation and
the excellent Force Drain capability will also help.

HB
Set up drains and Tat. Occupation. Retrieve some Force
and quickly probe.

OPS
Battle, battle,battle. Stop him from flipping.
Retrieve force when you battle. Try to retrieve
Controls to cancel drains.

QMC
This is all about occupying Bespin:Cloud City. If
you do this, you should win.

These are the main decks I see. I have tested this
a few times with proxies (the EJP cards) and it has
worked well.
There are some cards I think that could be in here.
They are: Jodo, No Bargain, Shut Him Up Or Shut
Him Down, Bubo and some of the new bounty hunter
ships.
Feedback is greatly appreciated. Please
give me some suggestions that will improve the deck.
I will be making a version 2 when I get some feedback.
