Strategy: '

I will add Battle Plan for something else.Sorry forgot that killer-card.
------------------------------------------------------------
Ive played a few tournaments at this moment and this Deck did well so here is the main idea
Try to make your tests as fast as possible
Stop opponents drains with Projections, Lost in the Wilderness, but use It Could be worse only for canceling Force Drains when you got Test 1 or you have enough S/A on hand. Stop his starships in space with Falcon SPiral etc.
 Dont test with Luke, this Deck is build to test with Daughter  Now you think why Boussh,
but this I will tell you later. Also track your Destinies for on the edge with Rebels at opponents battlegrounds.
----------------------------------
Ok your start every game with taking out Yodas hut with Dagobah game text and Yoda, his Hope and Backpack with Objective.If you have a projection of Sky. play it on opponents Battleground.
Pulle first Jedi test with Training Area and then draw cards up. In opponents turn search for next test.If its your turn againplay Leia and first Jedi test.So the next few turns try to do your tests as fast as possible which is not as difficult, because you get Test3 when you play it,
have Landspeed 2 and are immune to Set for Stun.
Now if you can get Jedi Test6 take Leia on hand deploy Boussh to Vader (as a Undercover Spy, and duel him in you move phase.It is easy to win it when you have tracked destiny for 5th test (usually R2-D2) so you will draw 2 7s.If you got that the game is over In every battle you will draw 2 7s as destiny opponent needs 6 ability and so on.The o0nly problems will be very fast decks.

Now the matchups
vs BHBM
give him Luke, track destinies for winning battles play On the Edge for retrival end so on.
Not to difficult cause he drains not so much.
Try to control Space with Falcon and Co and drop Legendary Starfighter on it.
vs ISB
once you get 1st Test he will be as slow as BHBM with drains. Make your game and battle where he drains to much and deploy to stop SAD.
vs Hunt Down
Didnt play against such a Deck but should be as BHBM but be aware of Luke getting crossed.

I think that is enough for you.Please rate my Deck and give me some advice
Thanx  '
