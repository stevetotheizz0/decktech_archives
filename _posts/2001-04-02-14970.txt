Strategy: '

 
 So there is my Snivvian-Deck

 First I ever wanted to play a Agents In The Court Deck
 since I read in the SCRYE Magazin is strong in Ralltiir.

 But if I build this Deck it becomes only a funny Deck.
 Why I play with Snivvian, I read a Snivvian and read
 Power +2 under "nighttime conditions" and May deploy as
 a "react". I think that is cool, and I wanted to play with
 Nigthfall.Then I think what Characters I can also but into
 hmm Spies deploy free. I take Corran Horn and Lando w/Vibro Ax.
 Then I need a charater to take my Snivvians lesser out then
 2. But into Tessek and Snivvians reacting for 1 Force

 I know I have many 0’Destinys but I will take it out with my
 Rep Geezum, he can take Sites into hand. Only
 Proplem is he must be at an extirior site.
 First geht him out on a exterior Site with support.
 Take out the sites and draw to become Tatooine System.
 Use The Signal to get Nigthfall if you not draw it. 

 Then I use Tatooine Celebration for Retrieving,
 with the Pulsar Skate, the Outrider and the Super Falcon
 I think I can handle the System, and I use Spiral for
 raecting( I like reacting cards). Take out your 2X-3KPR droids
 and make your Snivvians to power 5 Monsters

 Get Bargaining Table to block opponents Force Drains. And Drain
 on Tatooine. Please tell me by Reviewing what Card can I but in, and
 what can I take out. What is better, Please reviewed it. '
