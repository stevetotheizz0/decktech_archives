Strategy: '

this deck has a pretty good chance of beating the 'revo' deck, and a pretty good chance of beating a 'test to 2' deck, as well as 'profit.'

1 start oppressive enforcement or IAO
2 keep drawing cards until you get MANY locations (usually you can find them with IAO)
3 when you decide to deploy, deploy en masse.	your goal is to sit and occupy....don't fight too much until later on in the game when you've got some stacked up high destiny.

test to 2 gets smacked around by occupation.
profit just stalls out when you capture han with IG-88.
revo sucks when you don't give them anything to beat up on, and you can even-out the drain race later on in the game with occupation.	battling later should probably go in your favor, since you're getting multiple destinies.  crush only allows them to draw 2 destiny, jodo cancels one, and cabbel subtracts one from their total.

hidden base can go to hell

x-wing swarms will give this deck problems, but so what.

and if they're playing #s, they can go to hell...and you lose.
so what. it doesn't say that you're a bad player if you lose to #s.  '
