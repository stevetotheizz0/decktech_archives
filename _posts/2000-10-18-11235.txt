Strategy: '

I love using this deck.
First off, I start with Strike Planning, Insurrection, and Squadron
Assignments.  At That Point I am able to get Mon Mothma, General Solo, and
my commandos out.
A drain for 3 at kessel and practicaly cancleing battle
destinies with Han and Insertion Planning can really hurt an opponent.
The Sarships Can take out most anything thrown at them and the forfiet
bonuses minimize damage. A real key to winning with this deck is by
using the frieghter captian and kessel run, retrieving 10 force in the
middle of the game can often turn the tides. This deck packs tons of high
destiny, with a ratio of 1 in 4 drawing a destiny of >3. Then with high
immunity to attrition these cards tend to stay out all game.


Resent Changes
I Just got both a DSII Wedge and Jedi Luke so I took out my other Wedge and R3-T2 to add them. '
