Strategy: '

Not much Tech Here, But some.

Put Ephont Mon at Executor Docking Bay and then you have a site with absolute Protection. Mobilization Points makes ita Force Gen = 3.

Trooper Assault + Dark Jedi Presence + Dark Jedi + Stormtroopers = Big Force Loss

Lifttubes are there for reacting with Storm troopers and/or JEdi's  for a big battle.


I need suggestions fo rIprovement so please, Give it a 1/2 Star if you'de liek but give reasons and tell where to improve.

Thanks A Bundle'
