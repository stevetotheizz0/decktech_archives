Strategy: '

Start Audience Chamber and Well Guarded. Without Well Guarded, you'd be Grimtaash bait. Use Audience Chamber text to get Pote Snitkin out. He'll make Skrilling power 4. Beatdown with Skrillings. Mosep and Gallid will help your drains. Try to use a Twi'lek to get Scum and Villainy. It will make your Skrillings deploy 1, power 4, forfeit 3 cards. Get Occupation out with a few ships to Tatooine. Odds will be fairly high and you'll usually draw 4's for destiny. Towards end of game, try to use Abyssin Ornament for massive retrieval. Den of Thieves can cancel drains and First Strike/Scum and Villainy will provide retrieval. Might have some trouble against SAC.  '
