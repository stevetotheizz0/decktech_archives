Strategy: '

Ok first things first, I know you can't play Frozen Assets until the objective flips, but once it does, it becomes very useful. The reason I only have another Han Solo instead of Han w/ Blaster is that I DON'T HAVE ONE The only other choice was TK-422 and I'm not about to use that. And don't give me a bad rating just because I don't have this rare or that rare. As it is, most of the cards were borrowed from a friend.
Ok on to strategy, like I said you get Boushh out, play someone who loves you, get Han out and retrieve the force. I like to get the All My Urchins and Order To Engage, so that they are losing force to battle me, or not battle me. Fallen Portal is nice if you are at TatooineJabba's Palace because you can make them lose two characters. Vanden Willard and Jeroen Webb are spies so they can deploy to the Executor to cancel Visage, or somewhere else so I can have presence. Harc Seff is It could be worse, that cant be It Worse'd for adjacent sites and comes in handy when I can't force drain at Tatooine. The starships are nice for putting someone up at Tatooine to be a battleground loss from the objective and give me +1 in battles, and its a free drain if nothing else.
Update I have no Ben Kenobis Also, I get just enough a week to play in the tournaments. I'm working on a job so I can buy more things, Master Luke's, packs ect. PLEASE DO NOT RATE BECAUSE OF THIS OR THAT RARE O yea. I dont ALWAYS start w/ Insurrection, its just the one i use most
