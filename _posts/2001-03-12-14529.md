Strategy: '

Playing Start by Pulling the Death Star DB and Rendili then save your force for a turn unless you have a presense then deployh it on the Death Star Docking Bay. Then Deploy Vader on the Death Star Docking Bay and pull Cloud City Docking Bay

If you get Vaders lightsaber deploy it on him. To set up a drain for three at the DS DB. Next turn Drain for three, don’t forget to make them lose form Visage. Next turn Drain and Pull the Coruscant Docking Bay. Deploy Mara and Her saber there and a presnse if you have it and reinforce vader and mara. you’ll be dishing out 7 force loss per turn. Next turn Get Emperor and Janus down for another drain of 1 at the Coruscant Docking Bay. If the emperor or vader gets attacks pull a I Have You Now to help them out. after a turn or two, use transit to go battles, and duel them. With all of your battling and dueling interrupts you’ll win you battles and Duels easy if you do everything right. No matter what you are playing against basically fallow this method. THere are a few variation against certain decks, but Hunt Down is pretty easy to play, so you shouldn’t have mush trouple adpating to certain deck types.
