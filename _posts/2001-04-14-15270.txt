Strategy: '

pull docking bays. pull executer.
draw till you get vader and any of tarkin, emperor, mara and then deploy down to their site and kick their butt.
you are beaten key characters. disarmed a lightsaber, then duel and make them loose a lot of force. 
kill all of their characters and place luke and obi out of play then drain them to death at their own sites...as well as the constant eating away which visage does.
