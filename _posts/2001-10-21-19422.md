Strategy: '

 SCUM AND VILlANY WAS SCRAPPED TO KEEP STRONGER CHARACTERS 


 DECK EDIT 


Jabba The Hutt for Mighty Jabba - Harder to kill and adds another destiny.


Imperial Arrest Order and Secret Plans for IAO/SP combo. Takes down one card. Add in Zuckuss in Mist Hunter (more space SWEET)


Hutt Smooch for Hutt Smooch / Defensive Fire Combo. Defensive fire can be used if not playin spies.


 End Deck Edit 


61st Card - Security Precautions (for the popular regions with HB in it.)


Basic Strategy -After making a couple alterations to this deck, this deck is just so freaking pro. (at least its been winning for me.) 

I’ve played many people with this deck and it has yet to lose. It is kept simple, and not to card heavy, so anyone can play it. As you 

can see the Rep is Pote Snitkin. The reason of him being my alien Rep was because he had a good destiny and the non-unique skrillings 

are also high on the destiny charts. The main start most of the time is Desert Heart and Jabba’s Palace. I like to use Jabba’s Palaces 

game text to pull out those two extra zeros out of me deck, and leave 1, but if I could pull that one I would. The ones in the deck are 

kept under 15, (minus the ones you can pull.) just for the fact you wont draw to many of them. I didn’t want to lose power by playing Scum 

and Villainy, since that rips out Vader and Maul mainly, and they are a couple of good power houses to have around in bad situations. But 

mainly with this you flip and raid your opponent.


Dis vs Dat (local decks only)


Reflections III - (We’ll Handle This / Duel of the Fates) This one of the reasons why I like to pack so many Dark Jedi in this deck. More then likely while you are at the interior site with one of there Jedi, they will iniate a duel against you, fun fun. More then likely they’ll be playing the card were you can stack cards under them. This maybe thrown into there favor, since you wont be using it. But never fear This deck has a good amount of high destiny were can stand a chance, there are the 2 7’s, 3 6’2, and a load of 5’s. Or another way of solving this problem is to just run at them during your turn, iniate the battle, and try to take down as many of them as possible. 

(That is all on that for right now. More will come up when I think of inventive way to keep the new R3 decks in check.)


Hidden Base - Dead No one plays it anymore (at least in my area.) I have maid recent changes so this deck can actually mess with the opponenet in space. If its a flip then of course hunt out there hidden base. Most HB decks only play 5-6 planets, so with in a couple of turns you should be able to sniff it out, and take it down. Re-group Bossk and Zuckuss, if you like you can also with maul, but he can handle himself pritty well. Other then that, I would avoid battles at all cost. Also if your region is popular with HB then use Security Precautions. Keeps you alive that much longer.


Profit - Switch up the start from Tatooine Jabba’s Palace to Jabba’s Palace Lower Passage, just for the sake of not losing any

starting force for you. Your two starting aliens should be Xizor and Mara Jade. This is a good combo, since you can get Mara’s

Saber and the need 6 or more to draw destiny at the site. Try to hold the site for as long as possible, using the big guns.

One of two things will happen during the game A) they give up (not to likely) or B) the keep bringing it. Don’t convert the

Chamber, so you can use the game text to keep your leaders alive and well. This will be a close match.


Blow Up The Bunker - Swarm the bunker and hold it, this will be a fat battling going on, but since you have so many more 

characters then them, it wont be bad, since they’ll be more likely to lose theirs first. And remember to keep retreaving 

those Skrillings, so they can keep coming back for more. Also you can use Maul’s stuff to duel out there Jedi, to leave there

weaker more cheesier characters around.


There really isn’t to many different styles of decks in my area at this point. So when they come up with new ones, I’ll bring

up the strategies for those as well.


Also can I get the names of other counters against LS. I want to have this deck work against as many decks as possible. Thanks
