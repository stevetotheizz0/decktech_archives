Strategy: '


This deck starts at the Death Star. Against a Throne room start, start Imperial Arrest Order. I decided not to use Security Precuations, becuase i think if you are playing against a HB deck, the will normally wait to flip untill late game, when you have lost many ships. use secret plans every turn to see your deck. Recycle high destinies. Use the OTSD Ties with the Dreadnaughts. '
