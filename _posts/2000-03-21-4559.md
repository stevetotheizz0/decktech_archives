Strategy: '

ok basically you control ralltiir then battle elsewhere.
almost always start bad feeling so rebels deploy +4 to ralltiir.
you can pull any card you need if you flip, so thats why only 1 twilek and stuff.
use sandwhirl +desert= there screwed if they got guys there.

update
added vedsen (anti-odds), dropped tempest 5


vs stuff
ops-start battle order, try to slow them, then drop your forces and kill their t47's with big huge blue stuff in this deck.

profit- put no aliens, start bad feeling. they will free han, but then you battle and crush them as most profit decks have like 10 characters.

test5-start chybc vs most mwyhl decks. battle them while ther train, and shut them down w/chybc.

direct damage (order to engage/barriers,ect...)-
start iao.
grapple barrier, track destinies to alter order to engage.

hbx- start batle order. pull up dengar, put your scrubs on ships, have huge destiny (flipped obj plus dengar) will kill xwings.

hb kessel run-start secret plans (or try to get it out fast). alter kessel runs. battle. win.

faulke hb-start with bad feeling. flip quick, so you can hurt there drains. use omni box to screw destiny tracking for them. if they are hiding use chybc to stop omdh, also alter omdh if you can.
