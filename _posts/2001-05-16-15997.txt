Strategy: '

***ok sorry everyone, i am switching honour of the jedi for aim high. i didn’t realize you couldn’t start with honour****

Ok, first off please dont just give me a bad rating because its Mind What You Have Learned and you dont like it or have not seen a decent version. MWYHL can be incredibly powerful when used to its fullest potential. 

Ok now to playing the deck. You start with MWYHL and Dagobah. Use Heading for the medical frigate as your starting effect to pull Battle Plan, Wise Advise, & Honour of the Jedi. I do not use the combo wise advice because mwyhl has a built in sense and alter killer and the combo does not give you the training +1 bonus which is the reason I start wise advise. You may also say why am I not starting the way of things. But the fact of the matter is that doesnt even do anything since I pass my training destiny every time. Wise advice +1, yoda +1, yodas hope +1, lukes backpack +1, reflection +1, dos ability +5 = 10 + 4 dagobah sites = 14. so its pretty much a for sure successful draw everytime.

Using this order pull out dagobah sites using dagobahs game text yodas hut, training area, jungle, then bog clearing. If you get any of them in your starting hand then just deploy it and skip that site on the list.

You get to pull a site every turn. Pull Yoda, Yodas Hope out and deploy down to yodas hut. Next Turn, deploy Daughter of Skywalker, Lukes Backpack and pull out jedi test 1 using the training areas game text. 
Next turn, pass jedi test 1, pull jedi test 2 deploy it on the training area move dos and yoda over for 1 since yoda can go in lukes backpack. Next turn, pass jedi test 2, and pull jedi test 3 and deploy it on the jungle. Move dos and yoda over. By now you should have gotten a traffic control, with 2 of them in the deck as well as the signal. So start looking for the electrobinoculars, shouldnt be hard and throw down stuff in your hand to your used pile except for your jedi tests and stuff to start building the beatdown. Next turn, pass jedi test 3, and pull jedi test 4 and deploy it on the bog clearing. Move yoda and dos over. Get the electro binoculars on dos and start searching for a 7 to draw for jedi test 5. if they are playing sim aloo, then youll have to do it the hard way. [The hard way activate all your force and throw down a 7 with traffic control, then all you have in your reserve is a 7.  next turn pass jedi test 4 and pull and deploy jedi test 5 down to the bog clearing. Next turn flip dos over (jedi test 5). Then the next turn flip dos back over draw the 7 put it on jedi test 5. flip your objective and retrieve 10 force.

Now while you were training your opponent shouldnt have done very much damage against you with the honour of the jedi, battle plan, projection of a skywalker x2, and the red leader in red 1 with a landing claw. If you did lose more than 10 from other reasons (ie. Visage, search and destroy) then play on the edges and off the edges drawing a 7 and retrieving 6 force each time. Dont worry about secret plansthis deck activates enough to get around it.

Now you have your entire reserve deck and a beatdown force in your hand. Deploy down draw their fire and aim high. Deploy frozen assets on their force pile to utilize the draw their fire effect (they cant play any interrupts, ie. Ghhk and other annoying interrupts) deploy down a beatdown force. Use 3 force to take dos into your hand and throw her down with traffic control. Remember you can use 2 force during your control phase to pull a card from your reserve deck. Deploy EPP Han, EPP Leia, EPP chewie, epp han, epp obi and epp chewie. Intitiate a battle retrieve a force, opponent looses one. Hit everyone their, you draw a 7 so there is noone you cannot hit. If they are playing ecc ig-88 and you are afraid of them capturing one of your mains then hit him and play the blaster proficiency combo. Hes lost. Play all of your destiny adders. All your destinies are 7s  you get 1 from having ability over 4, 1 for epp han with chewie or luke, 1 for epp leia being with han, 2 for protector, 2 for dont get @#$%y, 2 for gift of the mentor, 2 for I know, 2 for skywalkers, 2 for life debt, and  2 for rug hug. Thats a total of 17 destiny. 17 x 7 = 119 + 5 for aim high + your total power of 23 for a total of 147. everyone there is hit and forfeit = 0. game overyou win by 30 +.

Some tech

-	Surprise Assault.killer they mass, they drain, you play surprise assault they have a total of 25 power with 6 guyz you draw 6 destiny all 7s your total 42 theirs is 25. they lose 17 force.
-	Stone Pile.notice how everyone sits their for most of the game with those 2 cards in their hand waiting for the right time.stone pile thoseshux their gone for the rest of the game.

Matchups

BHBM - play just like it says except give them luke as soon as they deploy vader. Easy matchup.

TIES - start aim high instead of wise advice. Battle plan and aim high will kill them. Deploy falcon with mains on and play destiny adders. Dont worry about talon roll cause gold squad 1 is immune.

Hunt Down - play just like the strategy says.

Agents of Black sun - play just like the strategy says. Jedi test 1 will win this.

Operatives - youve gotta be kidding me. all force drain bonuses cancelled from turn 2 or 3. projections. Easy matchup.

ISB - play how it says. If theyre playing big blue play similar to ties.

Carbon Freezing - give them obi. Pretty easy.

Scum - could be a little tuff. The end battle will kill them.

SYCFA - after they flipbeat them down on the death star, there force drain bonuses wont do nothing since you got jedi test 1.

Any other play just like the strategy sections says.
