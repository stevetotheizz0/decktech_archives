Strategy: '

Basically, I do not Flip so it doesn’t matter who my Rep. is 
(Usually I say Ephant Mon or Ak-Rev). First Turn
I Get The Audience Chamber And depending on how much 
Force my opponent gives me Ephant Mon and Ak-rev 
With Hutt Influence and Audience Chamber. If I don’t get 
enough Force to play both, I will wait till next turn
to deploy anyone and I’ll just draw some. As soon as Ak-Rev is out, 
I will start drawing musicians out of my reserve deck and fortifying
the Audience Chamber, hopefully getting Gallid, A pressance 
or 2 or Maul or Mara with stick in there to boost the drain
Vader never goes in to Jabba’s Palace so I don’t cancel
My None Shall Passes. The musician retrieval comes 
in handy to get back Maul Strikes (the 2 Weapon Levs are supposed to be strikes
but I am having problems getting them.) or Monnok.
After I set up, I bassicaly just try to force drain you to death.
Any suggestions would be appreciated. '
