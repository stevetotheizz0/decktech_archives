Strategy: '

This deck is pretty straight foward.  Always star Cantina and pull the Palace, then AC.  You may give your opponent 4 icons right at the start which your opponent will like, too bad that is the last force you will give them for the rest of the game.	This start also does a few other things<br>
You get 7 force immune to revo.<br>
The battle grounds neccesary for S&D and Resitance.<br>
And one solid drain 2 site immune to Lost In The Wilderness.<br>
You have effects that counter absolutely everything.  This is a pretty reactive deck.  Any specific questions write me and I'll get back to ya. '
