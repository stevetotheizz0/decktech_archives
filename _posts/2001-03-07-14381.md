Cloud City Chasm Walkway

Secret Plans

Prepared Defenses

Weather Vane (Tech) (Tech)

Crush the Rebellion

There is no try & Oppressive Enforcement



First Turn, deploy Bespin with the objective.  Use Secret plans to get Shocking Revelation.  Use Crush to get either I Have You Know or Evader & Monnok.


Turn, two get out Cloud City Occupation.


Here’s the tech, set up at the Chasm Walkway.  Use Vader, Mara, Boba, Dengar, and Dr. E & Ponda to send characters to the Weather Vane.  Here is why I like to play with the Weather Vane.  During battle, I can get rid of a lot of high power/ability/battle destiny adding characters.  Send them to the vane to get rid of them.  This is tech for battles.  Also, characters on the vane can’t be re-deployed.  It’s nice to have Han sitting on the vane and not running around.


Why no Dark Deal or Bespin Cloud City?  I don’t play with Bespin Cloud City because if my opponent controls that location, they can rescue people off of the weather vane.  The idea is to keep characters off of the table.  With out Bespin Cloud City, I can’t have Dark Deal.  It is fairly hard to get that out and running.  So, I don’t bother.


Menace fades also hurts Dark Deal.  It sees a lot of play in Watch Your Step and Hidden Base Decks.


Instead, just hit the opponent with the occupation loss.


Shocking is a cycling 5 that allows you to see what’s riding in your force pile.


Evader and Monnok allows you to keep a control over the opponent’s hand.


I have 3 grabbers.  Use those to get Harvest (first priority), The Bith Shuffle & Desperate Reach (Second), and other cycling cards.  Most players play with The Bith Shuffle & Desperate reach because they can use the card to cancel Imperial barrier or shuffle reserve decks.  That’s good.  If they play it to shuffle a reserve deck, grab the card.  That stops the opponent from getting characters off of the weather vane.


Sniper does make the characters lost, not sent to the weather vane (sniper card is the top action), but it does add 3 to lightsaber draws.  That can help for an Obi-Wan, Luke, Leia W/, Han W/, ect.


Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith and the bounty hunters are immune to Goo Nee Tay.
