************************************

Does anybody know anything about Cardtable. As in where can I get in touch with others who play, there was supposed to be a website but it doesn’t work. HELP ME if you have anything put it in the 5 star review(hehe) or d-mail me.

**************************************

 And now back to our regurally schedulled programming.

 Fizz....Crackle...Pop

  Hello,Well this is like my... say 7th decktech submission and I still can’t get more than like 15 or 20 people to rate me. Even though I not Hunter you can all show some kindness and generousity to rate me 5 stars. Plus in return I will rate you’re decks back. Ok + I don’t usually give anything less than 5 unless you reall f****d up you’re deck. )

 This deck is full of surprises that even can matchup to the best RST decks out there. a guy at my tourney I do believe he’s about number 20 in Alderran and I about 1500. anyways he took pointers and added some of my things to his deck cuz it’s full of surprises. This deck is 3-1 at my tourney, which is full of top Alderran players. The only thing I lost to was a solid ISB cuz I made a mistake and forgot to move the Lat. Damaged Super Falcon. I lost 15 force that turn. Anyways this deck only lost by 7. 


     Here is a rundown of my game


Early Game- Pull Back Door, Crix, Solo and Kensaric and Deploy them. Next turn get a scout get Bunker Deploy helpful cards and effects.

3rd turn get the Epic Event set up the Charge and Blow the Bunker next turn. The latest I ever blew up the bunker was turn 6, Cause he was using gay cards like Retwin and podracing.


Mid Game- Now that you’re objective is flipped you can drain freely without hesitation. Get out midge and you should have an Average drain of about say 7 or 8. Drop you’re big mains like Qui-Gon and Obi and do you’re damage. Don’t forget to retrieve lost Ability 2 scouts, and you should be set for the rest of the game.


Late Game- there isn’t much left except for the basics, Just battle and wipe out the opponent. Make sure the battles are on endor or a place where Close Air Support is in effect, and all the battles will be yours.


Card Choices-***********

 Corran Horn- Got trouble with Arica Blocking you’re BOOM session, Break her cover and give her a going away present, Lukes lightsaber in her @ss.

 Qui-Gon- Good power good card good character, Immune to attrition = yay

 2 EPP Obi’s- equals hit and run for Dummies. aka Vader Smackdown.


Matchups*********

 Endor Ops- What no Ominous Rumurs and A new Secret Base is Cancelled. Toooo Badddd, for you. 5 minutes later. Game win by 25.


 BHBM- This deck could’nt stop me even if they tried. Luke will keep his distance and maybe make a early drop on the Emperor so BHBM is no longer possible. Ohhhh, and I now have a 6,6 character that drops for 4, Ouch. Just beat up Vader and Tarkin with CAS. And you’ll win.


 TDIGWATT- start Menace Fades instead of The shield is down and they will be forced to come to you, and when they do you’ll have to play hard and smart cuz they bring a good mix of players to the table. Just blow the bunker and you should be fine cuz the 16 force swing will kill them.


 ISB- Once again Start Menace Fades and they won’t have any drains. watch for the Big Blue and the Trampling walkers on Endor. just play smart and don’t get caught, Remember this was my only loss to this decktype, but you can still win.


 Court- They will come to you so be prepared. Watch for the Bounty Hunter ships and The Droid squadron. Don’t get caught with you’re hands in you’re pants cuz’ they will likely try to get Madine early so be aware.

 MKOS- The same as above for the most part, they will use mains.


Ralltiir- Blink...Blink...Game Over you when. Auto-win, Should you lose you really stink and you should go and play Magic or Pokemon. Ralltiir can’t even stay flipped once I take control of Ralltiir close Air Support gonna hurt and It’ll kill them bad when Jedi Luke draws 2 destiny and adss 1 to power. There -1 drains don’t affect the flip side of you’re objective and you can win with relative ease.


 Well as always Have fun(isn’t that what this game is about...right?) Ohhh and if you have anything on cardtable please get back to me.
