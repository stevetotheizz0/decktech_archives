Objective:
ISB

Strategy: 

   I start this deck with Coruscant and The Signal and I usually pull out Imperial Arrest Order.  I can then pull out Coruscant DB and the rest of the docking bays so that i can reach my opponent whereever they are.	It also makes most of the ISB agents forfiet +2.
   I try to get a hold of the 2-2 sites as soon as possible with my walkers or vader and tarkin.  I then hold the site for the rest of the game if possible.  I can choose either tatooine or endor, depending on the opponent's moves.
   Resistance keeps numbers decks at bay, while secutiy precautions can be pulled at the beginning to go agaisnt Hidden Base.  Use the starships to quickly take complete control of space and enjoy the drains.
