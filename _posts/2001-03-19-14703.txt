Strategy: '

Straightforward M+T. 
Cannons are mainly for Hobbie, but I occasionally have to use themwith Wedge.
Anakin Skywalker and IFTC are to try to get Vader and are tech against Hunt down.
Beezer is mainly for pulling devices, and Kensaric is for increasing deploy costs to Imperials.
Use the Merc. Armor on Leia and another character of your choosing that you don’t want to be hit.

Matchups
Hunt Down  Try to take down Visage.  If my opponent is trying to duel, I will use Anakin and IFTC to try and turn Vader, or just knock him out of play if I win.
SYCFA  Tough in space, but I will try to invade the Death Star while Harvesting.
ISB Try to overpower their spies.
Court  Try to get into the audience chamber and control it.
Hansicle CCT  Get Han as quickly as possible.  '
