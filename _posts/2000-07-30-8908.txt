Strategy: '

This deck is my idea of a DSII Deck. Basically i use the operational as planned starting interrupt to get out DSII, jerrjod and desperate counter on my first turn, while also having the activation from endor occupation. having the objective out ensures that my activation at endor will not be canceled by strike planning. This deck has no intention of flipping the objective Use jerrjod to get out the sectors, and then get out TTIO. Move the DSII to kashyyyk, and get the <> sites down. Drop Vader and Sim and other guys to the sites, and help add to X for TTIO. Use desperate counter to get combat response out on the second turn. PLMK what you think. thanks
