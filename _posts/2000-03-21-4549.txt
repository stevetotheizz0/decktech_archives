Strategy: '

I'm not sure how to explain this one.
Should be pretty obvious from the cards.
Get a bunch of generation and Tunnel Vision to
setup the combos. The multiple Destinies can be
used to apply beatdown but I really wasn't able to
beatdown on anyone...people don't spread out much
anymore.

Against everything you should start Wise Advice
unless your sure of NO Sac or small amount of
interrupts.

v. HDADTJ  Dueling Protection and Spies. Pretty
much solid here.

v. Ralltiir Ops  I had a tough time busting up
Ralltiir Ops but after 12 Luke/Obi strikes I was
able to do it ;) I'll probably start adding Melas
and Bron Burs or something so I can combat this
decktype better.

v. Court  You can bring the Mains in with authority
Skywalkers cancels Imperial Barrier so you only
have to worry about None Shall Pass which you can
Grapple.

Anything Else  Manip protection , #s protection ,
Barrier stoppers...etc.
