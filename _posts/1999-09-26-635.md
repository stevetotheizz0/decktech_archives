Strategy: '

First the New stuff 

Order to Engage x2 - Helps versus Ops , Ops , and
Ops. This can also be a pain to the opponent when
they spread out to drain.

Harc Seff - more Ops protection , good destiny ,
also is a pilot which is sweet.

Noble Sacrifice - Drazin Protection , also gives
the deck good Regeneration.

How to play 
Don't commit your forces until you've decided
how you plan to win the game ( Remember you don't
have to deploy your sites ).

Main keys versus 

ISB- Battle Plan , Order to Engage , and Harc Seff
will do some major damage to the Ops player and
I expect kill them. It Could Be Worse is nice and
you'll usually have enough force to use DBTransit
if need be. Sorry About The Mess or Clash if you
wanna crush a lone Op.

Drazin- Noble Sacrifice and battling. Will be a
good game.Don't forget the Jedi Test stuff and
Order to Engage so you'll get a chance to kill
Drazin before he can do a Special Delivery.

Big Blue- Harc Seff , interior drains , and try
to get them to spread out then Order to Engage
them to death.

HDADTJ- Bothan Spies to cancel Visage. Insurrection
will stop the insane Elising HDADTJ decks. Duel
protection is en force.

Space- load the EPPs on one of a ship and keep
rolling around. Drain with Obi and Tawss on Cloud
City. Order to Engage with the EPPs. Bacta tank-ing
Wedge will be their doom.

Notes  This deck is really good and I saw a lot
of Testing to 2 versions of decks at my regional.
TIEs make a close game but pulling off Battle Plan
and Noble SAC will win it.
