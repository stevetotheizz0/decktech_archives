Strategy: 

At the Beginning search trough your reserve deck and look for 
the abba’s Palace location. then try to get the dog and drop 
it in the workshop. In your next turn deploy Ephant Mon to the
workshop.No deploy Boelo to the shop. I think with some None Shalls
and the two aliens the shop is clean for the rest of the game.
The only problem are the rebublic characters. For this ones I play
Maul and Vader with Stick, they will kill them fast. Now deploy 
the EG-6s to the shop. For each of them your drain is +1 in the shop.
When you have 10 of them in the shop you will kill the opponent very 
fast, and with Hutt Influence the opponent can’t cancle your drains.Block the opponent drains with the spys: Jade, u-3po and Black.
Maybe i must play more locations, because in this deck you don’t get 
many force. But I played this deck in a tournement and it works great.
I have won a lot of Games. So thanks for rating me!!!
