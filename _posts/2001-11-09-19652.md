Strategy: '

First Strike must be First Strike/Battle Order

Early Game First action of the game, if your opponent didn’t start with Don’t Do That Again Search for Rendili if he play with the defensive shield he could only play it after your first action.

You now activate 4 force + opponent force. Try to get Xizor on D*Db with Guri and a Vigo it’s always good and Emperor on an opponent site or on the blokade site or the Cor Db with a Presence of the Force with Ig-88 or Jodo and a Vigo deploy Bad feeling and keep a  Projective Telepathy in hand.


Mid Game You know activate for 10 + opponent force.Track like a machine with the obj and wait for luke or the beatdown.  Keep your ship and Control & Set for Stun in hand for a beatdown in space.  Hidden weapon is for Qui qon and Luke JK.


Late game  

Drain, Damage, and win. If you lost the D*Db you can retrive it with PASOA hehe.<


Match up

Vs all kind of space deck

Don’t grap Rendili for your first action instead grab S&D with YISYW.  Flip early for a max of damage like with emperor, POTF and a vigo on Blokate site and Xizor and Guri on D*Db

Sense key cards, Play Battle Order and Projective Telepathy, he will have to pay for his drain.

Try to beatdown with Zukuss, 4-lom, Bossk, First Strike, track four 6 and a Set for stun.. it alway works. Emperor must choke the undercover Spy.


Vs MWYHL

 Don’t grap Rendili for your first action instead grab S&D with YISYW.  Flip early for a max of damage like with emperor, POTF and a vigo on Blockate site and Xizor and Guri on D*Db

Sense key cards, Counter Anger Fear Agression with Projective Telepathy Track low for sense and prepare for beatdown with the defensive stuff.


Vs WYS 

Really cool Match-up. He will have hard time with activation and you too.  Play Emperor on 

Cantina and move Xizor on Tat  Db.  Don’t Deploy Rendili and D*Db for choke him.  Dengar is the MAN for shotThe Bastard Smuggler. Bad Feeling I Have make luke hard to play... Late game Beatdown in space.  You should win.


Podrace You can win the podrace personnaly I have win it 5 times and nerver lost it 2 vs a Podprofit and  3 vs 2 diferrent WYS Podrace.  The key is to start Allegation Of Corruption instead of Mob pointand sebulba podracer.  

Vs WYS Podrace First Turn you activate 7 force  you block him, draw a 3 if you have a sense and an emperor on table deploy emperor and sense if he play A Step Backward if not move Xizor on Cor db and Grab ASB.  Mid game try to flip his obj back to sense the others ASB and Track 6 to win the race and the game

Vs Podprofit same thing except that you must expect that he will try to sense your sence.


Vs Profit + Any deck without space

Deploy Dengar and Jodo Kast, try to deploy Palpy ASAP and Bunker the Audience with him.  Xizor and guri stay at the d*db. Deploy Rendili first turn with a ship and Battle Order he can’t pay 3 a turn to drain with his activation.  Battle Order will win the game


Vs Quiet Mining

Choke him, Deploy, Battle, Drain, Win .....


New Main Duel 

I think you could try to capture the main with a 6 and ig-88 or with hidden weapon or win duel with emperor and 2x 6. Event if palpy can’t force drain he does direct damage.

Sense  The first is never expect  by the opponent and force him to deploy defensive shield. Battle Order help a lot because he has to pay for his drain. And if you control a system with Zukass YCHFE is in action (if he play with Don’t do that again) and if you have a tracked 6 on top of your  deck you can lightning the first Jedi that come in front of Palpy (defence value -1 with YCHFE)Track is the key in this match-up


Hidden Weapon and 4-lom?  It ’s deadly vs Luke JK and Quigon or any Jedi with immunity 


Why Mob.  For force opponent to deploy the defensive shield, and grap a planet first turn or S&D

Cards I would like to add
