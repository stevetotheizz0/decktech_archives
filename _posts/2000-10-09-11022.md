Strategy: '

Set up your echo sites using A new secret base. Get a rebel there and hive him or her the binoculors. Then get 3 baraquins so you can lose 3 devices or weapons to force drain and then just retrive them. This works really well.  If your good at tracking destinies, this deck is for you. With 10 7’s in there, you can win battles insanly even with only 2 red squad x-wings. Make shure you get a 7 for on the edge so you can retrieve 6 force. This deck works really well, I hope you have fun with it. '
