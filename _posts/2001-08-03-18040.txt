Strategy: '

Heres the bad news first, the destiny draws in here are not great, but you can use maul to stack and overcome this.

Zero- 4
One- 21 Very bad
Two- 2
Three- 10 A little better
Four- 5
Five- 5
Six- 4
Seven- 1

Over half of your deck (after the setup) is pretty low destiny, so stacking is very important as soon as you can.Other than that its sheer power should win games for you.

Before you draw your hand pull If The Trace Was Correct from your draw deck.

Turn 1- Deploy endor landing Platform from deck. Protect visage as soon as you can. If you can drop a dark jedi this turn (vader) then flip.

Turn 2- Activate, drain, and play maul strikes to go get the matching lightsaber for the dark jedi you deployed first turn or the one your about to deploy this turn. Fortify and wait, they will have to come to you in some way to stop the drains.

Additional notes- Against dedicated space decks like Hidden Base just lose extra cards from hand to satisfy drains. Keep draining on the ground. After a few turns of draining and drawing youll have your bounty hunter ships. Drop them all at one system and hit them hard. They probly spread out their forces when they thought you didnt have any ships so now they get to pay for that mistake. Itll take your opponent a couple of turns to fortify so take advantage and clear another system or two, but dont split up your forces and make the mistake they did. Try not to lose any sites youve gained control of. Early pressure is key to this decks winning games. Also jedi are now much easier to deal with. And its safe to say youll see more of them than ever before. Mara drops maul into the jedi councel chamber and you have maul strikes in hand. You use it and windu is gone. You play dioxis and now two more jedi suck. Plo koon looks mad so you hand him his butt with you are beaten. You target and draw but barely manage to miss, or do you? Not with dark strike you dont then yoda steps up to bat with a jedi lightsaber. He swings and FORCE FIELD a miss Mara smiles and targets the runt jedi master, swing and its outta here Yodas head is out the park As you all can tell, Im looking forward to this deck a lot.      '
