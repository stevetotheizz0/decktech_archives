Strategy: '

Use ties to control space.Deploy your spys undercover to BLOCK force drains.

And retrieve cards from lost pile like crazy.


IN SPACE

-COMBO-One dreadnaught & all power to weapons at a system will make each of your your tie interceptors power 6(power 7 with x-wing) and immune to attrition.

-Death star assault squadron with same combo is power 21.and immune.

-Put 2 probe droids(ISB’S)on a dreadnaught

and you have a forfit of 10.

-Retrieve your lost probe droid when you flip your objective.

-Use Captain Piett(NON ISB) to take a probe droid into hand any time you want.

-If you lose a tie FROM TABLE put it in your used pile with Sienar Fleet Systems(this effect rulz).

-Retrieve one force when you deploy a tie or three when you deploy a squad.

-Use Dreaded Imperial Starfleet to cancel a force drain.

-Security Precautions will give you an extra force activation If they play hidden base,wait till they flip before you deploy it.(sometimes they flip early then you have them)probe with your droids, when you find the hidden base you retrieve for each droid and they lose force.

-Commander Merrejk(ISB) will let you deploy a battleground system from reserve deck when he is on a dreadnaught.

-Lateral damage will add to their pain.

-Ghhhk combo card will stop their hyper escape,reacts and stupid landing claw.plus give you some protection on a beatdown.

-Short range fighters will let you retrieve for each tie inceptor on table.

-If they go in space, you own them.

AT SITES

-Dont battle what are you nuts?This deck only has probe droidsUse undercover and BLOCK their force drains.They break your undercover? "Oh boo hoo "Deploy a tie get your undercover back in your deck and keep droping spys.I did run 5 undercovers and then found out I didnt need 2 of them.

-put a restraining bolt on your probe droid at a site,they cant battle it.and your objective will make their force drains -1 at related sites.

-Point man...just to wipe that goofy smile off their face.(sometimes i swap it with suprise assualt.)

-abyssin ornament...you can still "once per game" your probe droids on table.

-I am not the best player in my area but this deck has been a pain in their butt. '
