Oh and sorry...Luke Skywalker is actually the virtual one if you didn’t catch on...

****END UPDATE****


****UPDATE #2 ****

For lack of somethin else take out the weapon lev and put in corporal midge

****END UPDATE****


K...This is for an upcoming tournament of NON-EP1 DECKS...So neither myself nor my opponent will be playing with ep1 cards...yeah no lsc


Now...to start get your general’s during the opponents turn...if you already got one get the other 2...if you don’t get crix and calrissian...


1st turn Activate, Deploy crix, chewie and wuta, get another site if you can, get back door, draw up if anything left


2nd turn Activate and drain, Get a ship to endor and maybe try another character with the crix and co. draw up...


3rd turn and on Blow that bunker up, drain retrieve and cut down on theirs if you can...suicides with the epp saber guys...a jedi’s resilience...etc...


Pretty simple deck I think...try and get your 3 effects out when you can as you can satisfy the 2 that need it rather easily and goo always helps...

DON’T SPREAD OUT AND ALLOW BEAT DOWNS


Match ups


Hunt down DON’T SPREAD OUT AND ALLOW BEAT DOWNS...try to cancel visage asap...really just follow your own strat...might be better to keep luke in his ship this time but this deck is untested so i don’t know for sure...just stick to blowin up the bunker...


Dark deal Get goin asap...menace fades will be huge...if you think you can try to take bespin...might wait for late game on that though...got lots of retrieval so should be able to outlast them...


Court and Scum Just don’t let them beat you down and you should do great...


SYCFA or whatever Try not to get shot out of the sky and get your ground troops out fast to blow up the bunker


OPS and stuff never played against it so don’t know...never seen it in my area but I figure menace fades will be a big factor


Alright that’s all I can think of right now...

See anything that might help lemme know...

review with constructive criticism please...
