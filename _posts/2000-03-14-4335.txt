Strategy: '

Update Forgot to put Secret Plans into the decklist.  Put in Secret Plans in place of the Sniper.

Very straightforward, balanced DS deck.  Default starting effect would be either Crush The Rebellion (go get Evader for Revo) or Secret Plans (usually against Profit decks or if you suspect a heavy retrieval theme).  Just try to get Vader out right away.	Aside from the starting stuff, there are only eight locations, but I find that I can usually manage with that amount.  Both ground and space power are good, so try and get Battle Order going and knock out either LS's ground or space.  Most of the characters are good pilots so they can go into the ships and walkers.  For arconas/spies, I have Arnet, Bubo, and Sniper in the deck.  In my area insert decks are quite common so two Tortures are a must.  This is an all-around solid deck...I think it has a good chance to beat just about anything out there, with some careful playing.	 '
