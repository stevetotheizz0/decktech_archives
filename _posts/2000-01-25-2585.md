Strategy: '

Oh and of course you will need to add the New Light Objective.  I forgot to put that in the above deck.

I have play tested this deck againts all kinds of decks.  It does very well, even if they Grab Harvest(which is only a bonus), this deck still hurts them.

Start with WISE ADVICE everytime.  Use the Grabbers for Sense or Screw, or whatever they seems to be playing.  Use Narrow Escape(very important card in this deck) and Fallen Portal to keep Han Alive longer.

There is awesome Hunt Down Protection, plus Harvest will help get most things you need back.

I would go into detail how you can beat certain Decks with this, but I know most of you can figure that out.  If they play Odds on the Darkside in your area(not in mine) then take out Mechanical Failure and Weapon Lev, and put in two Don't Forget the Droids.  Which I would do if I will going to a Con anytime soon.  Of course I won't be going to one until Orgins, but that is another story.

Enjoy the deck.  It rocks.
