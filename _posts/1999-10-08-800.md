How to Play

Against Ops
Use Harc Seff and Order to Engage. use mains to beat down, and draw there fire to stop ghhk.

Against ISB
Get Obi to Station ASAP and draw mains quickly. Tunnel Vision will help a lot. They wont be able to stand up to your mains and Order to Engage with Harc Seff.

Against HDADTJ
If they have duel out, deploy with caution. Try to get anti-dueling cards quickly. High destiny will help, along with Tunnel Vision. Get 2/0 sites out as quick as possible. Spin executor sites, or infiltrate with spies to cancel Visage. You should be able to out battle. Out of Commision could get Vader=GAME OVER...

Against CCT Use Scrambled Transmission. Out of Commision will stop Special Delivery. Infiltrate with rebels. They normally dont have a huge battle force.

Against Big Blue Try to get out Battle Order so they come fight you. Spin twix sites to get a drain going. Get the falcon, and other ships to go fight. Landing Claw is a card most DS decks pack counters for ( read Homing Beacon x2)so i left it out.

This deck is strong, and I think I have shown that.'
