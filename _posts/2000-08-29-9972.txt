Strategy: 

Changes from the first version: 
I took out a Dreadnought, 3 intercepters, a Short Range Fighters and Zuckuss in Mist Hunter. I added a Twi’lek Advisor, a Sienar Fleet Systems, a Oppressive Enforcement, a Mobalization Points, a Inconsequential Losses,and a Prepared Defenses.

Stratagy: 
An average Tie Intercepter deck. I start with Inconsequential Losses because then if I lose a battle by 6 or less I can just lose a TIE and Gun and they BOTH go to used Pile !!! Use Mobilization Points to  pull Wakeelmui. Try to get a Sienar Fleet Systems early on by drawing, or using a Twi’lek. Use tie intercepters to retrieve and overpower the opponent into a wimpy little baby. Use the cannons to shoot everything in the sky down to the lost pile. Use battle deployment to screw anyone who doesnt play with capitols. Comm. Brandei pulls ties while on a star destroyer. If played correctly, this deck is unstoppable. All of the rest is self explanitory. If you do have any questions just drop me a line.
