'

Strategy: '

Tactic

-I use ,,Crush the Rebellion’’ to get Evader/ Monnok out of the 

 Reserve Deck and then I play Monnok to make all but 8 into the 

 use Pile.

-With I’m Sorry i take two Cloud City interritor sites into hand 

 before i activat force

-with talon roll and the ties i can easy hold the sky.

-with the trooper and the trooper assaults can i battle my opponent 

 with characters, wich are very cheap and with the interrupt power 3

 or 4. 

-with characters, like lobot, lando can you flip your objectiv very

 fast.

-with set for stun you can make inportant characters into the hand.
