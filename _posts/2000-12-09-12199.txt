This is my version of Steven Lewis* (Sir Yoda) *Invincible Court* and I would like to give all credit for the foundation of this deck to him. When I saw the Invincible Court deck I thought is was a very strong deck but needed a few changes. I have now gone ahead and made my own version of Steven*s deck with my own twist thrown in. So far I really like how the deck has turned out as well as my changes. Now I*m sure you all have seen Steven*s deck (if you haven*t go to The decks section and click on *Invincible Court*) so I won*t go through the basics again. But what I would like to do is show you the changes I made and why I made them.

 PLEASE REMEMBER WHEN REVIEWING THIS DECK that I do not need much force. With Scum & the cheap Bounty Hunters (and ships) you don*t need much to deliver crushing blows. Also the stuff that makes this deck a deck is my *tricky* cards and retrieval..not brute force 

ALSO I know a lot of people think I should add projective tel. While that would be cool there just isn’t room (if I pull controls then the Projective Tel can be sensed). The card can be grabbed, sensed, etc and I just don’t think it’s worth adding unless I base my deck around them (which I*m not gonna do). ALSO I only have one Galid in b/c he isn’t a big key to this deck since it is more of a battle deck. One is enough trust me.

STARTING I have changed the start around slightly so thagt I can start *Power of The Hutt* in favor of There is no Try.  Power of the Hutt is just TOO GOOD to leave out of the start of this deck and I can pull There is No Try quickly with a Twi*lec Advisor.
If you try the deck out I think you will find this start much stronger.

Cards in-Cards out I took out the following from Steven*s deck

*YOU CANNOT HIDE 4EVER* - With 3 Twi*lec Advisors I can pull Security Precautions as well as Search & Destroy quickly. And NOBODY (I mean nobody) plays numbers in my area.

*SECRET PLANS* - I yanked Secret Plans b/c 1) MWYHL is dead in my area & 2) It really doesn*t help that much. I guess if I lived in a region that used MWYHL a lot I would add it, but it*s not worth it for me.

*CANTINA* - I found that Cantina really wasn*t a good drain site since it is far from Jabba*s Palace and it gives the lightside a good drain site.

*CC ENGINEER & ORS* - When playing PROFIT the two reasons Steven used the CC engineer to convert AC was to be able to activate 1 more force per turn, and to be able to pull Beolo. I solved both cases in, what I think, better ways. I added another DB which gives me my 1 more force per turn, and the DB can be used against other decks as well (not just Profit like the CC engineer). I also use Power of the Hutt to pull Beolo AND Ephant Mon which I can do this more then once.  I pulled the 2 ORS b/c they were only used to pilot Jabba*s Cruiser which I pulled for another Bossk in Ship.

*OOTA GOOTA, SOLO & HUTT SMOOCH* – I know it would be very nice to use Oota Goota, Solo but with the HUGE use of IOA (like 90% of the decks use it) is anyone gonna even play Nabren (people in my area don*t). Also I pulled Hutt Smooch in favor of a second Sniper. I mean really this deck has SO MANY weapons and Sniper can be used to toast undercover spies as well as many other uses.

*CHALL BEKAN * - I pulled him b/c his main purpose was to pull the CC engineer.

Now for cards I added

*POWER OF THE HUTT* - This card is a MUST in this kind of Court deck and it works MUCH better then a CC engineer. If you think my version if weaker against Profit then go look at my start VS Profit below (it is much stronger then the CC engineer).

*NO ESCAPE * - I added No Escape b/c HOTJ is still used in my area and b/c I am really afraid of HOTJ. You could pull it if you know you won*t play anyone using HOTJ.

*BANE MALAR & 3rd CONTROL* - Bane is just another good bounty hunter, especially against Han & Chewie, so I added him. He can be yanked for another Zuckess in Mist Hunter if you want (I may do this). I added a 3rd Control b/c I really hate my cards being S/A and Control is a nice card when you keep retrieving it.

Now after all that here are some deck matchups
VS PROFIT
Really a piece of cake. What you do is start Mighty Jabba & Mara as your 2 aliens. On your first turn pull one of your Docking Bays as well as Mara*s stick. Then pull either Beolo (cancel a battle destiny) or Ephant Mon (adds one battle destiny b/c of Mighty Jabba*s gametext) with Power of the Hutt.
  Next turn activate 6 and deploy either Ephant Mon or Beolo (whoever U didn*t deploy the first turn) and whatever else you want to do. Wow, you already have power 14, a saber swing, 2 destinies, and you cancel their destiny, which you did all without the CC engineer. Once you get Scum & First Strike out you will be rocking away. Just battle & retrieve and crush those mains. If you can get Han, Luke, or, Obi captured or placed out of play the game is over. Use your disarmed, hidden weapons, etc to just mow down everything in site. And if they started alien Han and use OTE with Bo Shuda then just cancel it with Point Man.

VS Hidden Base
 Get set up and get out your effects as soon as you can (use your 3 Twi*lecs) and see what they do. If it is mains & toys sit back and drain and let those bad boys come to you. When they do promptly slaughter them present them to Jabba (for his amusement) and continue on with life.
If you are playing a real Hidden Base deck then get S&D established as well as your objective. This loss = 3 per turn and when you add your drains to this total they will be hurting. Use hit and run attacks to retrieve 3 and make them lose 1 (Scum & First Strike) and probe their base when they flip (if they don*t flip they are dead). As Steven said, the direct damage of this deck just kills them.

VS MWHYL
This will be the hardest match since Test 1 & Test 2 hurt a lot. But, as Steven said, if you get out fast & get your objective and S&D going they are history. If they deploy mains before completing test 5 they will be easy to kill with your tricky cards. If they don*t they will lose so much force that even if they flip it won*t make a difference. Again if MWYHL is big in your area then pull something (maybe Point Man) to add Secret Plans.

VS Y4 mains
This deck will be easy. If you can get out No Escape you will stop their force choke which will help. Since TR mains is a reactive deck they will come to you, which will allow you to start a slaughter with your nasty cards. Use Scum/First strike to retrieve a ton and kick your opponent*s mains out of the galaxy.

VS There is Good in Him
As Steven said don*t deploy Mara near Luke and just pound him with your combos. Elom swarms won*t hurt at all. Really a very easy game.

VS. Rebel Strike Team
I just love how Steven says this so I just have to quote *HA you win. Wreck his guys and drain for tons. Most Strike Team decks can*t handle your heavy interrupt package. If he wants to drain for 1 at Endor, let him.*
   I do believe they would be able to drain a little more but really RST is dead before the game starts. Your guys deploy cheap and kick butt.

Thanks guys for looking at this deck. I hope you like my changes and will give me constructive reviews. Please don*t give me low rating b/c you say I copied the deck. I think that I made enough changes to call this my own deck. I once again thanks Steven for the GREAT foundation of this deck. Thanks guys

COK - Don’t see what’s not to like about COURT it is a really cool obj. But I guess if you like Imperials a lot it would be hard not to use Darth (I had to do that -)

Thrawn - Hey Chris thanks for the review. Also thanks for your help in my changes (although I pulled Dannik -P

Worra - Golly what do U think BHBM or TIGIH decks are like? All of them basically are the same but with difforent playing styles. So I didn’t steal the deck (like Copy and Paste).
