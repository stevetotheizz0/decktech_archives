Strategy: 

**Update**

When I want to do Dark Deal, I deploy Bespin and then my ships.  I draw my ships and deploy when ready.  All I have to do is control Bespin, and then land them at the docking bay.  You just don’t deploy Cloud City, because they will take it over.  

I made this deck right after NC States (Im Stupid), but my other version of the deck went 2-1(losing to Agents In the Court).

So I thought, how could it be better.  I looked through my CC Box and saw Dark Deal and Vaders Bounty.  It hit me then that my drains would be +2, and if I used Mosep it all comes from reserve deck.  I have 2 CC:Security Towers in so I can get Vaders Bounty out ASAP.  

My combo with Vaders Bounty is:
Vaders Bounty on Luke + Boba Fett + Hes All Yours Bounty Hunter = 13-18 force retrieved.  Not bad, because no one uses Aim High, and if they did, paying that much is worth it.

I have Responsibility of Command and Much Anger In Him in there to stop DTF/Beggar (because they cant initate Battle and Force Drain).  Then I can just drain at Cloud City while they lose 4 force a turn.  If they alter it, use Sense.  If they alter that, use Control.  If you to capture a key character of theirs use We have a Prisoner because it plays for free and is immune to Sense.  Put Vaders Bounty on them and use Hes All yours Bounty Hunter to get it done faster.   If you play it right, you can retrieve your force in one turn.  I dont have Mob. Points in here because you dont need it.  You just get 2 docking bays.

Also, you DONT have to convert Luke, it would make the game go faster though:)

Matchups:
WYS:Take over the Cantina, drain like mad, use Secret Plans so they pay like mad.  Guri and Jodo help with Multiple Destinies and Dengar can pop them off.  Put ROC in space and use the Bounty to retrieve.  

MWYHL:In my area it is dead and they use Luke to train. LOL.  I dont use Search And Destroy because I dont have to.  I drain for 10, and they lose 3 for Your Destiny.  If they use DOS, Use ROC so they lose 4 force, and if you can complete the Bounty then go for it.

Profit:  Bounty Luke, battle with your Bounty Hunters, retrieve.  Attack Ben, drain like mad.  If they get tough, then use your Trample and Set For Stun to get rid of 2 battlers.

Hidden base w/ship and mains:  Easy win, they may cancel my 2 drains, but it wont be enough.  Mains-easy win.  If they use OMDH, they will have to pay to retrieve.  Basically, drain like mad.  Battle them, lay the beatdown.  Retrieve.

EBO: Dont attack unless you see a good oppurtunity.  Drain, ROC them if they are at 4th marker, and get as much as you can out of that.  Use your walkers with Bounty Hunters, then retrieve.

Any help is needed, and please give me a good thorough review.  

Thanks,
