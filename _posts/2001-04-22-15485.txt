Strategy: 

***UPDATE as 4/23***

I took out All My Urchins, Obi/w saber, Chewie’s gun, Civil Disorder, Fallen Portal, all of the troopers, Nar Shadda Wind Chimes.  I added Tala 1, Tala 2, Lt. Blount, Advantage, Wookie Strangle x2, Ultimatum, Balanced Attack, Luke’s Saber, Coruscant, Grimtaash, and Close Air Support.

***End Update***  

Cards:

Turns:  Pull Crix and/or Solo, Pull COK, pull Wuta, pull a site. 2nd turn, pull Midge, get a ship out. 3rd turn, pull Brooks Carlson, and by now you should have out Gen. Solo. 4th turn, get out another scout, flip. 
5th turn, drain for about 5-6. Retrieve a scout. 
7th turn through the rest of the game just drain and retrieve. I usually win by 10, 15, 20, or higher. 

I don’t blow up the Generator because it is too card extensive, but it can help. I use to blow it up and on one turn, I blew it up they lost 8, and then I drained for 12. 20 force, boom. 

I was thinking about putting in Admiral Ackbar to get out my AO faster, so please let me know if I should in the review. 

Otherwise, this deck is pretty basic. 

Vs BHBM: You win, drain and kick @$$. Give them Luke, and drain. They get a beatdown next turn from my scouts. 

Vs Court: Go to space and drain on the ground. Usually, they have no ships or weak ones, so just attrition them away. Control Tatooine if you see Tatooine Occupation coming. 

Vs MKOS: Same as court 

Vs HD: Tough. I have only played one, and only won by 4. Cancel Visage, don’t deploy Blount or Cracken because of Put all Sections on Alert!  Then they drop a beatdown squad.  If that happens play It’s a Trap! and that will save you, hopefully.  If you deploy Luke, watch out for Dueling.  Just drain.

Any other deck, just drain and retrieve.
