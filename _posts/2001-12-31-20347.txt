Strategy: '

We’ve all seen this kind of deck before and honestly, there is nothing new here. However, this is my first attempt at a court deck with the very limited collection that I have. Please give good contructive reviews and card replacements etc. Also, please include what to remove if you state a card which is needed. I already have a small list of these
Ghhhk - Essential But the deck is tight
Hidden Weapons - Same as above
Zuckuss in Mist Hunter - Dont have one
Defensive Shields - Don’t have any

Now that we have that out of the way, here is how I play the deck
Turn one I set up and draw my hand. Activate. Deploy the Tatooine Dbay and take the Spaceport Dbay into hand. I almost always have a guy to deploy to the chamber or a dbay. Save the JPChamber text for when you need it most. Draw whatever you have left.
Turn two you should be getting a max of 8 force. Hopefully the opponent has given you some icons too. Activate, Drain, Pull Jabba or Chall and deploy whichever if you wish. You’ll want to put down a few people at the chamber as the turns pass. Essentially you use the interrupts to get some weapons and effects out. Get the bountys down, capture, retrieve then snipe your captives as not to flip the objective. Scum and First strike will work with capturing to make your retrieval engine. 

Why 
Marksmans - Built in sniper + Stun Gun + M’iiyoom
Arica - Undercover 
Weapon Lev - Get guns
Vader - Suicide
Extra Iggy - Dont Know
Baba’s Peashooter - As good as the Stun Gun
Lyn Me - Boba comes down free
Dengar gun - Jodo + Dengar gun .... Destiny + 5
2 Sniper - Iggy works perfect and I love the card
Thok & Thug - Power 12 pretty decent
U-3PO - 2 spies undercover better than one
2 ships - Probing is about all you can do with these crap ships. 

I think that’s it. Please excuse some of the crap cards and the lack of good cards. My collection is very limited. Feel free to D-mail me a complete redone decklist if you wish o) ...Now to create a lightside.
