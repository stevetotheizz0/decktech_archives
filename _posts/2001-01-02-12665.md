Strategy: '

Specific Card selections

Battle Order most profit decks don’t play any space, it’s worth it to pay to drain for a few turnstill you get a GOOD ship.
No Escaperetrieval(LOL), if opponent plays the  SpaceportDBdeploying chars at -3 is HUGE
Presence of the ForceLets make Vader a spy(inside joke)play it and drop in.
Disarmedit is KING, hurts enhanced chars, Dr. E can opperate, and power loss
Masterful Moverecycling 6, if Visage is Cancelled go and get another
Dreadnaught & Chimaeraships with good power
M’ilyoom Onithkill chars out of hand, WHEEEE
2* Janusno other way to cycling cards

Specific Matchups

HB use Secret Plans in start, look for Security Precautions Search and Destroy and ships, probe(don’t spread) and drain.

EBO use Imperial Decree to stop HUGE drains, try to conrol 2 Hoth sites without Vader(Ice Storm will make Vader lost)

Profit use Battle Order to screw opponents drains, still put Zucuss and another ship on Rendili. Start Mara and Dr. E as your aliens. Use Bad Feeling Have I and M’iiyoom Onith to stop your opponent dead.

Mains and Toys or numberswhen in doubt play You Cannot Hide Forever

PLEASE REVIEW. thank you.
