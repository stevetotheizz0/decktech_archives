Strategy: '

This deck uses the beatdown combo, but now with the power of the new combo cards.


If you need more information please take a look at ”WYS Falke Beatdown”.


Tatooine and Coruscant habe brought some new decktypes. So I changed some cards to manage this situations. I thought that It could be worse will do fine for podrace damage, It`s a hit as backup card for It`s worse.

The second OOC/TT is very useful against Brangus and Huntdown.


One major problem for the beatdown combo is now the possibility for dark to activate in the opponents turn (Wipe them out, All of them) and the new alien character ”Televan Koreyy”.

He cancels Beggar and Frozen Assets, but this deck is also prepared for him.

He`s a power 2 character so chewie can cancel his gametext for this turn I`m planning the beatdown.

For the ”Wipe them out” problem use your beggar and if your opponent activates the Force in battle, just use Mirax or play an Out of Commission/TT.


Some card explanations

A Jedi`s Resilience I`m playing four Saber Lukes and it`s a destiny 6 card.


Inconsequential Barriers cancels Barrier, Set for stun (and Combo) and None shall pass.


Dodge best card in the starting hand... But don`t forget that reacts can be canceled.



Have fun,


Martin Falke
