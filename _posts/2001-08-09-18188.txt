If you really wanna know how to play this deck you can dmail Bottomly.  Of course he’ll just tell ya to go to hell but whatever. 


*** Good to a certain extent, but the 3,720 to 1, MIGHT get you like what? 1 force loss on your oppenent.... and why the Hoth Echo War Room? I’m sorry I can’t give this a high rating unless I understand it.... Call me a newbie or call me a dumbazz, I don’t care...... But if you do.... Ask yourself this one question...... Would I say to someone at work.... DAMN THAT Employee over there is succccccchhhhh a newbie I’m only bringing this up, because I expect it.... If you were going to take the time to give the deck more credit, you could have at least given the stradgey.....  

nice thoughts ya dumbass...you’re not a newbie you just @#$%in suck...why dont you read some of the cards?  and learn to @#$%in spell '
