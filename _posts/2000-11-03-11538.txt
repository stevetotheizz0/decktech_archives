description: Good old court deck. Hit’em hard and fast for a 4 force swing every time. Perhaps not as good as Mr. Lewis’s version but fun and strong.

This deck has a good blanket to cover ground and space. Recirculating high destiny and multiple battle destinys keep the light side off the table. Direct damage is in ther to punish non interactive decks. Props to Info Brokers’s court deck that gave me the frame for this deck.

vs HB-get your precautions and S+D out quick. Spread a bit on the ground and combine your forces in space to lay the smack down.

vs TGIH- let Luke have his site. Make them come to you. If you see Eloms-kill’em. For speeder and X-wings, duck into the AC and Cantina, in space use Dengar to make sure the swarms take a hit.

vs EBO-let them get set up then knock and then knock em down in space. Once again S+D comes up big.

I’d like to add some stuff to this deck like ”#’s defense, another Scum, No Escape, a grabber and perhaps Dengar on the ground and IG in space.
Any suggestions are welcome.
