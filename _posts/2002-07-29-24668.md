UPDATE #1

Well, since this deck wondered into the top 10, I guess I’ll respond to some reviews.

deckmaker12 HD is a tough matchup, but defnitely not an auto-loss.  Watch out for character removal, and try to avoid battle until you are ready to fight(gift of the mentor, I know etc.)  Step can get your Han or any needed character back.  Use OOC/TT or Corran to take care of visage.  Like I said, this is not an easy matchup, but no an auto-loss.  Like i’ve always been told, and have seen for myself ”Decks don’t win games, players do.”

Bean2213Alot of people are concerned about the no space against SYCFA.  Yes they can do a lot of damage, but I can set up my damage faster.  I get a first turn flip and hit them for 3 the next turn, and can even spread out faster since their ground will not be much.  I should win the podrace during turn 4 or 5, so there is 6 more plus the 12 damage I have already done(3 a turn for 4 turns)  With retreival I should come out on top.




Use 10 D-shields of your choice

This the the LS deck I used at the Origins open, as I said earlier it went 3-0 and helped get me 7th place in the open.  Madprops to Mike Pistone for helping me out and telling me to keep the podracing in.  Leave the racing in, it will win.

And win it did, even with some doubts on weather or not I should have raced.

WHY RACING?

Its like Mike told me, if they race and you dont, your going to lose anyway, if you race and they race, you have a chance, with this deck, a very good chance of winning.  Ulikely against a deck that will play 5 collisions and lots of 7s(rarely seen anymore)  Against the average DS racing deck, you have a chance.  I admit that I thought racing was almost a waste of deck space as well, but I was soon proven wrong as winning the race is what played a big part in two of my wins. One game vs an ISB, he had a lock down all set up except for decree.  I won the race, and there went decree off the top. The DS shield dont hurt that much, to prevent the race damage they have to spread out which will leave them vulnerable to a beatdown.  The least anyone lost to the race was 4.  As for suspending I did it, most play the coward shield anyway, so you already have 2 battlegrounds.  When you want to retreive, drop a guy to a third site, retreive, then move him over.


GENERAL STRATEGY

The power behind this deck is speed.  I never retreive with profit, and I usually dont retreive with the race because by the time it is over, I dont have much of a lost pile.  In your opening hand you will get 90% of the time, Ben, Master Luke, or Leia.  Deploy them to the Audience Chamber first turn if opponent did not deploy anything there, grab their matching saber and flip.  Next turn you will drain for 2 and do 1 for Profit.  Get the race over ASAP(usually turn 3 or 4 unless against a dedicated racer) and cause 6 more damage from the race.  With a few turns of profit and draining leading into the end of the race, odds are they will have lost something valuable off the top.  From there, use the rest of your characters to spread out and drain, or to go after the opponent to slow him down.  The ideal set up for me is to get Luke and Ben with sabers to Jabbas Palace with gift of the mentor in hand, and Han leia and the audience chamber with I know.  EPP qui-gon(I only have 1) is there for hit and runs, as is a spare EPP luke mainly for hit and run against combat.  Corran is there to cancel visage or for dropping in on there 2/0 site to drain for more or to lead a beatdown.  I made the choice of no space, even though Mike recommended it, as it lowered the destiny a bit and figured any dedicated space deck i.e. virtual fear, would have landing claw defense anyway.  I saw very little space and never had the need for anyships.  If you worry about space, fit in rebel leaders, 2 claws, and a yoxgit.  I only have one R3 lando, that is why I play the one with axe.




MATCHUPS

Instead of mapping out how to play against each deck, I have organized it into three different ways my opponents have played against this deck.  

AVOIDANCE  Mostly in the form of ISB, garrison and dark deal, or big blue.  They see the profit objective and may think that going to tatooine would be a mistake, so they will stay the hell away from you, avoid battles, try to lock down your drains, then outdrain you elsewhere.  With the exception of dark deal, this is quite an easy matchup.  You set up very easily and start draining and profiting, odds are they will lose something important off the top from all the damage you cause.  Walker Garrison can cause problems, but with the extra damage from podracing and your retreival, you will come out ahead.  Dark Deal is another matter, if left alone, they will out drain you.  I either go for some ealry offensives, and try to take out a key character, or wait for them to setup and commit the big guns, then attack their weaker points to slow them down.

NON-AVOIDANCE  These decks, mainly combat and senate will start off doing their own thing all the while getting a beatdown squad set up to come after you.  Be cautious here and watch out for character removal, mainly sniper, which is canceled by its a trap, or dr.e, which you can bounce with master luke or use Its a trap to cancel the battle then respond next turn with some beatdown of your own.  Watch out for Maul with double stick, that can get quite ugly.  Fight them off of tatooine then commence with Profit and draining.  If they get too big of a force to tatooine, it would be best to avoid fighting and keep pinging them.  I consider DS senate to be one of the toughest matchups, because they can setup a beatdown squad pretty quickly with Lot Dod.  I tend to avoid fighting at all costs against a senate deck.

AGRESSIVE  This refers to mainly Hunt Down, BHBM, or Court and scum decks.  All these are capable of first turn characters to the Audience Chamber, and may even start aliens.  Court and Scum are pretty easy to handle, they will pile up aliens in the Audience Chamber, drop Leia to cancel all their ability, free Han and get out to start draining.  Avoid battles to limit their retreival with Scum.  Hunt Down and BHBM can be more of challenge as it is not as easy to free Han.  If they pile in at the chamber, drop Leia, play someone who loves you  to free Han and fall back to drain until you are prepared to fight.  If they are smart, they will put a force down at Jabba;s Palace as well to block your escape.  Start by clearing the audience chamaber, setting up destiny adders will help greatly.  Get Leia there to take care of two of their drains next door.  If you can slow their drains with projections and pile all your guys with sabers at the audience chamber, drain for a bunch, with retreival you should be able to out last them.


Thats about it, if you have any questions please D-mail me.

Again, mad props to Mike for helping me out.
