Strategy: '

     This deck will get a good early start against everything.  It can hold its own against just about every popular deck out there.	MWYHL gives it trouble, but not much.  Against Ops, Battle Order and the Racing Swoops with a beat down crew on each  one will cause trouble.  Hidden Base won't last long once Security gets on the table and you have all of your ships either running or holding down a particular planet.	Against the Revo/Nudj deck you shouldn't have any problems.  Use the two Advisors to get what ever effect works the best against your opponent early on.  Other than that Cirle ( we all know what Circle is), You Are Beaten and the swoops will make the ground an uncomfortable place for the opponent to go.'
