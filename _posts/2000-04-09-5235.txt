stratagy edit
where i play SAC is not a big problem so i have no need for it. I also hate 2/0 sites cos 8 times out of ten i draw the danm things as destiny draws so i dont have them in the deck
the only problem this deck has had so far and it went undefeated at my state titles was a profit with eloms and well when i got my darth in hand that was the end and with empires new order i got a hloe lot of force back





ohh k

well the basis is get the sites down put ts 3 5 n 6 on the ground with the 3 atst pilots. This then alows u to chase the oponent with vader, tarkin, igar, veers, mara and the others if u dont want em on ralltiir and with the +3 to your destinys pick the battles.
4lon with eraser is just too sweet with tarkin and vader.

Vs ops Start come here u big coward with empires new order or resistance set up your flip and then hunt down the ops and retrive

MWYHL  start broken consentration but be weary of epp beat down so get bad feeling asap and with the obj it makes it hard to beat down.

Profit u start with Bad Feeling and use scaning crew wisely along with imperial barrier and woonded wookie u should be fine

Qmc Watch out for eloms so the most likely start would be empires new order or bad feeling. If sabbaccing take out the lando asap and u should survive .

Any other deck type start with IAO or bad feeling if u suspect a mains n toys but with vader tarkin and 4 lom with eraser u shoud be safe

well i have used vareations of this deck since augest last yr i just love this objective force drain -1 2 force for any card and the + on the destiny draw u have just goto love it
