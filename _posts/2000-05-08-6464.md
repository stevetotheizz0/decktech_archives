Strategy: '

Against Throne Room Mains and/or Revo, start with Casino.	That will give you 2 starting force to help against choke.  Everything else, start Port Town District.	It gives you a drain of 2, and gets out aliens cheaper.  Start with IAO, usually.  This will get out first-turn docking bay, prevent Nabrun, and help a couple of guys' forfeit.  With all the bounty hunters in the deck, All Wrapped Up is a great M&T counter.  Try to capture as many mains as possible to prevent a major beatdown.  Get out Cloud City first, so you have some force to work with.  Don't deploy Bespin at all.  Get out Cloud City and stock your ships there.  Set up Dark Deal and drain ASAP.  If you wait too long, they will flip and cancel your drains.  Speed is the key when facing HB.  Use your caps to probe, and get out Precautions.  Should be an easy game.  Against mains, make sure not to leave any guys vulnerable, or keep a Ghhhk handy.  Drain as much as possible, as early as possible.  Focus on Occupation more than Dark Deal, as most mains decks dont pack that many ships.  Your fleet should be able to fight the Super Falcon with ease.  MWHYL will probably be your toughest game.	Broken is not in here because Test 1 screws you up the most, and even Broken will not prevent Test 1 from happening.  So, instead, spread pretty thin, maximizing your drains.	Concentrate on Presence and Occupation, as they neither are Force drain bonuses.  If you're lucky, you can cause 10-15 card loss every turn.
Now, OS-72-1 is a sweet card.  For a measly 5 force, you get power 7, ability 2, and a battle destiny, all for 4 force at Cloud City.  Drop a Combat Cloud Car, and the City is yours, while adding 2 to your power at all Cloud City sites.  Don't worry about flipping, this deck can win easily without it.
Good luck, and May The Force Be With You.  '
