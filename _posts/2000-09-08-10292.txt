Strategy: '


I had a mind lasp while typing this , I forgot to put down prepared defense


   First off I know I'm not playing much space thats because super Falcon is dead. Imp Command Admiral Piett and the Executor can do a lot. But now let's talk about the deck.
  Charecters are normal. Piett is for Imp Command plus he's great on Executor. Colonel David is good and effected by IAO. If I had them I would play 1 Darth Vader, 2 Siths, and 2 Lords, but I don't.
  These starships in my opinion are the 3 best for the dark side. Chimaera is immune to attrition without a pilot power 8 and forefit 10. That is good enough for me. Dengar in One cancles oppenents immunity to attrition and adds 1 to your battle destiny. Executor,enough said.
  Only effects that may need an explaination are the Much Anger in Him, Responsibilty of Command, Hoth War Room, combo.
  The Imp Commands are to grab Piett and to cancle the Uber Falcon.

MWYHL Get out the docking bays and drain with presenses of the forces. You should do enough damage to stop them from retreving if they flip.

Hidden Base This is the hard game. Again get your docking bays and drain. Wait for them to flip to deploy precautions then beat down the smallest force the have at a system and probe around.

Profit Go drain them at there sites. The walkers and the high destiny help a lot. Track 7's trample, track, trample, I think you get the idea.

Rescue. This game is a joke. Put your walkers down fast and, trample the droids. If they do get her freed chances are good that they will not put many charecters if any with her so you put down Iggy capture her and site some where.

Constructive Advice is welcome.     '
