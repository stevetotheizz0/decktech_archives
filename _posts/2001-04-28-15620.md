Strategy: '

 
 This was my Deck it plays in 3 games (5-0)

 2 Full Win, 1 Modiefied Win.

 In the Modified Win I make bad mistakes it was

 easy to win full but i to the false thing.

 The Dark Deck makes my 5th place MKOS only win

 one of 3 games I played with Dark Deck 3 Times

 against WYS and there are only 4 WYS at the Tourney


 This TIGH plays against two MKOS and 1 Court Deck.


 The first thing is I played Rebel Scout Luke, he

 can cancel the Immunity of combat vehicles and

 relocate to Throne Room (against BHBM)


 In the 1st Turn I get out General Solo and 

 General Crix Madine, get Crix to the Home OneDB

 and Luke to the Endor Docking Bay. Take Chewie

 in. Next Time get Wuta out Deploy a scout to Madine

 (I dont want him alone). Most of My Characters

 are here for battle, use the Scouts to beat down

 your opponnents Characters. And Drain with

 Luke Leia and Midge at Endor. General Solo with

 Rebel Leadership is very Powerful. 

 I fight against a Scum Deck, with 6 Scouts 

 and add a Destiny with Rebel Leadership, he 

 cancel one with Boelo a 2, second was a 6, with

 Take the Initative Battle Destiny 12 12 attrition

 it was Bad for Scum. One Destiny cancel and with 

 Insert Planning Oppponenst remainig Destiny was 0


 This was a battle that hurt much

 Corran is good for this Deck works great against

 bounty hunters and he is spy and can use with Take the 

 Initative(Powerful Card)


 I get Under Attack and Concussion Missle for

 Sail Barge and other combat vehicles. 


 This Deck works very good  '
