Strategy
First your starting site is Tatooine the system, Then you play Combat Readiness to bring out the jabba's palace, at this point you basically tell a profit deck player to move over, so then you look for the audience chamber, and the other jabba's palace sites, there aren't a whole lot of them because, the abyssins in this deck can hold there own power four, when myo is on the audience chamber, which that is where you put him, then you get the other tatooine sites out so you can spread and drain, Also during this time, you want to get some big blues up on tatooine and hook up the tatooine occupation, if your opponet, puts x-wings down there smash them with later damage and the big blues, make sure you get scum and villany out so you can retrieve, den of theives out so you can stop some force drains, then you elis helrot to where ever they put their army, In one game i did this and the guy thought he was safe so i ellis helrot, 4 abyssin's to another site where abyssins were, and that made 10 abyssins then i ellis helrot, again at his site and smashed his mains, the regenerated my abyssin's. You should try this deck i love to play it, it is so much fun. '
