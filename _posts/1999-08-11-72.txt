Strategy: 

Choose your starting effect on what you think your opponent is playing.  If they start the throne Room or any Tatooine Location, then play the Cantina as your SI.	Then confront the opponent anywhere you can.  Most of the characters in the deck can draw destiny by themselves.  Setup a small drain force at jabba's Palace with Galid and Mosep while fighting your opponent when you can.	Sense, Alter and monnok can still hurt a great deal of decks, especially Hidden Base and other swarms.	If the opponent wants to hide, then Come Here You Big Coward and Search and Destroy will make short work of them.  If the opponent has a droid in their lost pile, play Reegesk and steal that droid, deploy it, and Torture it.  You can do this repeatedly to retrieve lots of force.
