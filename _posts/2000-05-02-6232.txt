Strategy: '

im sick of red cards so i tried not to use to many. characters and machines are way cooler. start insurection for the docking bays, flip asap and defend dantooine with speeders, hnemtes and pilots. opponent will now drain -1. youve got undecovers to take care of the worst drains, and visage/dueling is handeled by sticking obi or luke in a speeder. then go for space with the squadrons and drain like mad.

this is an acces deck so dont take it to seariously. i couldnt think of anything else constructive that is not already posted multiple times. this deck has potential against some deck, its my attempt of making a LS raltiir deck.. i have at least won a few games with it

Well I'm packing up my game and I'm a head out west
Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the hills chill like Flynt
Buy an old droptop find a spot to pimp
