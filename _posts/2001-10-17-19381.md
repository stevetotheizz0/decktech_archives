 This Deck is the Best I have played. I&#8217;m Sorry if it isn&#8217;t acceptable, but I have $12 to work on total per month. I myself dislike the fact that everyone must have the Emperor to be a good deck. I could have bought the Emperor before, but I don&#8217;t want to. Please rate this deck according to what you think is fair for a kid who has no money and does his best. 


Anyway, on to the stragey. 


I have only played one person very many times, and that is my brother. He has only played 4 decks, QMC, Profit, WYS, and Echo base. This following text is from my last game, against WYS. 


Turn one 

Played Imperial Supply 

Started the Podrace w/ a desiny of 5+ 3 

Played Mind Tricks 

Deployed Watto from deck 

Deployed Wittin to Mos Espa 

Put Boba w blaster at Junkyard 

Flipped, Made him lose two, and put a Jawwa in Used. 


Turn two 


Force Drained for 1( I ditched Wittin because he tried a quick beatdown. Used Mind tricks.) 

Deployed Aurra, Skiff, Jodo and Dengars Gun on him. 

Battled. 

Shot at chewie and missed. 

Shot at Chewie and hit. 

Used jabba&#8217;s through. 

Drew Three Destiny and destroyed the resitance.

Force Drained for 2. 


Turn four 


Retrieved force lost from a space drain and he lost 11 due to Podrace. 

Force Drained 


Turn Five 


Battle. 

Me Aurra, Boba, Jodo, Watto, Jabba. 

Him Lando w/ blaster and captain han. 

I Captured Lando with dengar&#8217;s gun, relieving him of the WYS destiny, and leaving him with 3 ability. 

Drew 3 desiny 0,0, and 2. 


 This deck is a strong one. Most of the times I have played against Shaven Talz, I have lost. Like, 50 of 51 lost. Imagine, me winning by a large percentage over him on my first try with that objective.



Strategy


WYS- Take over the Cantina as soon as possible. Drain there and win the race. If you start fast enough, I see no reason not to win.


Profit- Put down Boelo and Boba w/ Blater for the objective. Get Watto and another guy at the Junkyard. If you have enogh force, put down a card at Mos Espa. Then, Put down a card for YAS. If they lose, move the character and try again later.


Echo Base- Do not try to take over Hoth. Focus on Tatooine. Put down Resistance instead of Watto’s Box, but fish for the Box too. This is the toughest matchup I have had. '
