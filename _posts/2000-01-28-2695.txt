Strategy: 


	      This is my updated M+T deck with 6 new cards.  OE and the grapplers were put in to combat all the nasty rebel interrupts these days.
	      YAB, Sniper, and Alter are all useful cards as well.
	      I created which combines power with versatility along with other
	      elements such as force choke. It combines ideas I've read about in Decktech as well
	      as my own experiences. The strategy is simple. Go to where they are and take them
	      out. For non-interactive decks, use the force draining locations in the deck. I prefer
	      not to use objectives in M+T and needed quick force while also having a starting
	      effect, so the Death Star fits the bill nicely. Nemet shuts down reacts while
	      IJASKAW stops Landing Claw and Undercover. Against Jedi Training,
	      try to invade Dagobah quickly while setting up your own
	      force drains. Against Hidden Base, start Security Precautions and use your powerful
	      starships. Anything else is your call on what to start with. I like using senses to
	      cancel whatever interrupts come my way in order to establish control. Everything else
	      is pretty basic and easy to figure out. Note that I do realize that there are a lot of
	      decks like my one here, but I feel since this isn't Hunt Down and prefers controlling
	      interrupts while also having some key elements of its own like Sense and Nemet,
	      that it's an effective as well as creative deck. Thanks for reading,
