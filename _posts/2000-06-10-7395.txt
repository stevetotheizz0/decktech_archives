Strategy: 

	In this deck I normaly get a Vader in my hand. So I search for either the Death Star or Endor docking bay. Then depending on what my opponent is doing I either get out the other docking bay and put Vader and Tarkin or Mara and Boba at them plus get out the presence of the forces. Or I get one or two people at the docking bays and go beat down them with the rest.
    Search and destroy helps by makeing them lose an extra force at the end of each turn. First Strike is for a little force retrieval and cuts down on their interrups. The four extra visages are there because of there destiny and it is beater than holonet transmission.

   Ops: I don;t know because no one in my area plays it but I think it would fair preaty well.
   Mind: I have not lost to any that train to five but I have lost once to a train to two deck.
   Hidden Base: Not many people play it but I might put some ships in and secuity precautions in depending on the advice I get.
   Other: I just go beat them down early so the can;t set up.

   All advice is welcome.
