Strategy: '

Well it’s not that complicated, but here goes

use strike planning to pull han and madine before you activate, before they do anything on THEIR turn.
as soon as you have 6 force(max 2 turns), deploy geezum, madine, and shimi (via slave quarters).  If you have enough force, you can dump threepio at some other location to start tracking magic.
use geezum every turn until all locations are out, Insurrection pulls DB first turn.  plus, there is a pretty decent chance that you will get a site in your starting hand.
BATTLEBATTLEBATTLEdrainBATTLEBATTLEBATTLE (phew) until the opponent has no, I repeat, NO characters anywhere within 376 parsecs of tatooine.

Han and Chewie are pretty much a given to have out, han pulled by SP and chewie by madine.  The camp protects against mara ( a little) and slows down things like ISB mobpoints,etc...
Sense and alter since I have so many high ability characters
destiny is decently high, but not so high that sense and alter will fail

barriers are useful, even in a beatdown deck

with a gift, artoo + threepio, and shimi, there is a possibility to subtract up to 4 from EACH of their battle destinies on tatooine, which is pretty mush where they stay anyways.  Well, that certainly helps against the battle section of Ralops, doesn’t it?
speaking of ralops, (and ISB, all the like) Underworld contacts helps to preserve my drains
contacts also keeps my tat sites on top of theirs

Losing Track + jar Jar + BM munchen = much pain and suffering and laughter

I just couldn’t resist the marketplace, but maybe I SHOULD take it out...lol
the padawan man is always a nice card to bounce around
Inconsequential barriers is nice to cancel several annoying cards like NSP

there are many ways to mess with battle destinies
 skywalkers
 gift of the mentor
 protector
 smoke screen
 chewie w/ balster
 leia w/ blaster
 gen han
 shimi
 artoo + threepio
 A gift
 changing the odds
 losing track
 lando w/ axe
 lando w/ gun (sometimes)

 wow that is almost 1/4 of my deck heh

anyways, You pretty mush wanna battle the heck out of the opponent and drain if if comes down to that (heaven forbid)
but even draining isn’t that bad, esp with underworld contacts out

main weaknesses (so far as I can see) are
-somewaht slow start, depending on given avtivation)
-podracing
-heavy drain decks w/ beatdown protection (not a WHOLE lotta tese, though...)


well I guess that’s all, this is the second deck like this I’ve made, first on tatooine.

thx for your reviews
