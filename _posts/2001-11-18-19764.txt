Strategy: 

oh yeah this a ls deck listed in the ds section sorry

this deck is a pile but its not bad. you get out nekkid 3po fast and cycle hi destinies and setup combos. you use your characters for hut and run attacks while you drain in space.
you have a good shot at winning the race so go for it.
the big guys are good with thier sticks. pdme is good on the eopie and jarjar is fun. yaura is a solid backup guy.

watto-attack them, hit watto.
dueler-hit and run, space drain
racer-win the race
senator-drain in space

lmk what u think
