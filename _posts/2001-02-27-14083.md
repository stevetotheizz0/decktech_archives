Strategy: '

(Excuse my poor typing, I´m using a foreign keyboard) Where to start?  Well, this is a pretty straight-forward Hunt Down deck w/o dueling.  Why no dueling?  First of all, I have found that I can win w/o it.  I´ve only dueled once 3 tourneys with a dueling deck but still won every game.  Second, I don´t like to duel...I get so intent on crossing Luke that I get away from the other strong points of the deck.  

Now that that´s explained, on to the strategy...


I´m sure you´ve all seen decks much like this, cause I´ve seen plenty, so I´ll spare the details.  I know this is not an original idea for a deck, but it wins...almost all of the time.  I´ve only lost once with this deck, and that´s because of a stupid error against an EBO deck that cost me the game.  What I really want out of the reviews is some suggestions on how I can tweek this deck.  I´ve been away since R2 was released and I´m not 100% sure about the character selection, but it has worked for me so far and the changes seem to make it even stronger.  Thanks in advance for your help.


The best parts of this deck are massive activation quick, nice force drains with the sabers and POTFs(regularly 6-7 a turn), and the ability to battle pretty much anyone, anywhere.  Weaknesses Revo and Undercover Spies, but I have´t seen ANY in my area since I started playing this deck.


Notes  Only one extra Visage because OCC/Trans Terminated WILL show up, and unless I have like 4-5 Visages, there´s really no chance of keeping it on the table if my opponent doesnt want it there.  2 Miiyoom Oniths because she is the ULTIMATE playa-hater.  This deck gets so much force going so quickly that you can search your opponent´s hand EVERY turn and still have plenty of force to work with.  Just drop her with Vader, Tarkin, Dr. E  and IG-88 and your opponent will have a hell of a time getting to her, and if he does, it´s likely that there´s another one waiting to be dropped down next turn.  However, this is based on the meta I´ve seen, so don´t criticize it cause I know she won´t work in every area, but in mine, she is a God.  In one game, my opponent did not get ONE freakin male character on the table the entire game, which meant he only had DOS to work with)



Matchups


WYS  I haven´t played this one yet, as I´ve been in Spain for a few weeks, but I´ve heard that it´s tough.  Here´s my idea  start Something Special as the 3rd effect to prevent retreival abuse and use the 2 grabbers to take care of any nasty interrupts from rising from the dead.  Try to use DLOTS, You are Beaten, Put All Sections on Alert, and Guri and Xizor to prevent a crazy number of battle destinies, etc.  For anyone who has played a WYS deck, your advice would be greatly appreciated.


EBO  Start Decree.  Occupy two Hoth sites.  Battle and Drain.  If you play it smart, you can win almost all of the time.


Other decks Play it smart and you´ll be fine.  This deck can hold it´s own against pretty much everything, at least as far as I have seen.  I know this isn´t very helpful, but I´m supposed to be working on my Senior Thesis right now and there are plenty of other Hunt Down decks on Decktech with better, more detailed strategy sections that I would be plagarizing if I continued...


So there you have it...I really think this is a strong deck, considering you can win even though everyone and their mothers know how to play against it.  With R2, I think it only gets stronger, but I´ll have to wait another week to see if I´m right...


Thanks   '
