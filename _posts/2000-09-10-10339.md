Strategy: '

Hey. This is my post Death Star II MWYHL X-wings. You train Luke Skywalker because of the activation bonus. Test 1 and the Projections and undercover guys will slow their drains while you control space. Drop an X-wing to Kiffex and Kessel and use Hyper Escape or Houjix if they come to get you. On your turn use S-foils, Incom Corporation, and Organized Attack to beat on their forces. For Zuckuss in Mist Hunter or Dengar is Punishing One use X-wing Cannons. Power Pivot is good for the Executor or a Star Destroyer with pilots on it. Against BHBM give them Luke and take over the skies. Use Legendary Starfighter on the Falcon for some additional force loss. If you want to increase your differential play All Wings Report In once per game and then sink your X-wings. This deck has trouble against TIE's because of their massive retrieval but if you play smart you can win.'
