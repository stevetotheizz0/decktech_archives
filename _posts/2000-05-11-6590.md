Objective
HB 

Strategy: 

start w/ battle plan. use #s while you set up. use #s and O2E w/ narrow escape and hyper escape. dont flip HB or deploy mains till late in the game when the opponent has lost most of their characters. dont deploy the mains if theyre playing HDADTJ. use punch it and then legendary starfighter to beat down ships and cause damage. u actually dont need to play in space. they only get a drain of 1 at evry system
