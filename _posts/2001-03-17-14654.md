RESPONSE TO REVIEWS


Add more space Orginally, this deck had 4 ships instead of 2 but I found that since they were hunter ships, leaving them alone was a bad idea, or that I would deploy two of them together, but then it would take away from my ground. (FiS1 for example), so thats why there is light Bounty Hunter spac. The reason I dont use Guris ship, is that unless I get Guri on it, its not that good. True, with this Obj. its not that hard to do, but Guri is almost always needed on the ground, and she cant probe, which is all I really need my ships to do. 


”Remove space altogether” That is a good idea that I considered, but when I tried that, a flipping Hidden Base just screwed me, so I need the 2 ships to just do some ”Chump Probing”, really, that’s all they’re in there for. It’s a meta call.


Without Vader, Tarkin etc. you suck in battle Hmmmm, some people have never seen a good scum deck beat up on somebody...or seen the bounty hunters tear into mains....I pity them.


To the guy who said Wait, Luke screws this deck, I only say this Wait, Luke srews Hunt Down or, Wait, Obi-Wan screws Huntdown too.


End Response.




When I first posted this deck I had only played about 3 casual games with it. Since then, my friends and I have playtested this thing to death and it has beat WYS Lewis Style, WYS Palace Raider Swarm, Hidden Mains done RIGHT, EBO Done RIGHT, AITC Chadras, Chus X-Wing Swarm, and T.J Holmans DPC Light Deck. Granted, the builders of those decks werent playing, but what this means is that this AOTBS deck has the tools to beat all of the popular decks. (With the exception of Profit, havent tested that yet). So, when reviewing, dont just say WYS kills you because it doesnt...Steven Lewis might, but just saying WYS is an auto-loss is wrong. How it beat those decks is described below.



What this deck does is set up at the Death Star and Executor (via Presence), and establish some high damage (Lose 2 to the Objective, 4 more from Vigo Enhanced-drains, and possibly 1 more from S&D) waiting for your opponent to come and battle you...and thats when the fun begins. 


First of all, this is going to be a somewhat long strategy section as Agents of the Black Sun really isnt played that much. If you think youve already got a good feel of how this deck works, Rate Away If not, read on. 


General Tech 

Plan plan plan plan Cant stress that enough. To fully use the flipside of this deck, you need to know what you plan to do in your deploy, battle, and draw phase. 

Battle battle battle battle You want to cause as much battle damage as possible. Like it says above, set up your damage, but still go looking for fights, dont run

Track track track track This is hard for most players, including me (I lost a game against Douglas Harvilla because of 1 poorly timed On the Edge), but, this deck makes it easy and you wont win if you cant track...to some extent. 


Particular Tech 

Get Xixor to the CDB first turn and Carida from deck for good second turn activation. Move him to the DSDB for a (hopefully) second turn flip...hell, even if its not a flip, move him there anyway. 


Once flipped, start using the Once Per Turn, may place a card from hand in used pile to peek at cards in force pile as a Janus, a Tunnel Vision, and a Reactor Terminal. Start setting up your destinys for battles, see whats in your force pile, and get rid of duplicates. Start setting up your hand too. If you need that card that is 5 cards down in your force pile, find some way to use that 5 force...then draw it. Or, if you need to stack high destiny for battles, start putting back MM, TwiLek, SHUOSHD, etc. and now you have 5s and 6s set up that your opponent hasnt seen you play. 


Really abuse the Once during each of your battle phases, may peek at top X cards of any reserve deck, where X = number of locations you occupy True, this may only be like 2-3 cards, but it helps...big time. Never look at your opponents deck as you cant change that, always use it on yours to know when to do what in a battle such as Detonating a Thermal Detonator, playing Hidden Weapons, Vibro Axe, play WDYTM, etc.



Card Tech 

Put All Sections on Alert Great battle card to be used both Offensively and Defensively. Use it to protect Xixor from EPPs, or too really srew your opponent in a battle. 


Resistance Anti-EBO. Stick a Presence on CDB, EDB, get to those 2 bays plus DS for cancellation of mass drainage. 


Thermal Detonator Great way to kill Jedi Luke...or anybody Just track whatever destiny you need with VOTDP.


Counter AssaultSince you can use the Force pile thing on your opponents turn too, you can stack 3 high destiny cards before their next drain. Good against a lot of stuff. 


Deck Tech 


WYS 

Ignore space, get set up at DS and Executor, wait for them. Soon, take over the Cantina with whoever (with a well-tracked Detonator, its easy), and battle/capture their scrubs. Look for a Beatdown, and even Counter Assault their drains. Grab whatever you feel hurts you the most (FP, Harevst, etc.) although I usually go for portal. A well-timed Monnok can be killer.


Hidden Base 

Set up at all 3 Docking Bays with S&D for a total of 5 in drains, 2 from the Objective, and 2 from Search and Destroy. Then, start probing with fodder and/or a Ghhk. 


Profit 

Start whatever bounty-hunter aliens you want (doesnt really matter), then just battle and use your captureing to win battles and ultimately, the game, but make sure First Strike and Blast Door Controls are out. 


Mains and Toys 

Any variant, auto-win. Really. They will have to come battle you to deal damage, and with PASOA working in conjunction with the rest of your tech, this game is no problem. 


TIGIH 

Actually youre toughest match. Keep Luke away from the Emperor, try and make him come to you so you can play PASOA or Sniper, or WDYTM to make battles swing your way. If this is hot in your area, add in a Always Thinking with your Stomach. 


Agents in the Court 

Speeders would be tough...try for a really good timed Counter Assualt and then battle as best you can, but a tough matchup. Otherwise, just battle, non-unique aliens have little to no chance against your hunters and their tech, seriously, they dont. Just dont leave yourself open for a huge swarm beatdown, and watch for a devastating Counter Assault. 


Weelll, thats all the strategy you should need to win, good luck and have fun with this deck. Later.
