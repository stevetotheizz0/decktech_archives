Strategy: '

 
When I can get a hold of another Vigo, I will replace Bane with it. 


First turn, depending on your hand, pull either corsucant DB or <> DB and move Xizor over for activation.  Make sure you have some back up if you get <> DB, and you can flip first turn.  Also pull Rendilli with Mob points.   If they are playing mains, get Bad Feeling Have I out a quickly as possible.  With 3 Twi Leks it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard.  This is a ground battle deck. Use your interrupts and weapons to capture all the LS characters.  Capturing Luke will probably win you the game.  If he is not on the table, you are getting huge attrition bonuses and you can capture people with all wrapped up.  Use your objective to put back a high destiny card in your used to see what is in your force pile and where, it helps a ton to let you use your resources effectively.  Also, during your battle phase look at the destinys on top of your deck, use your weapons and interrupts (Hidden Weapons) in accordance with those destinys.  A 6 on top?  Iggy captures Ben.  A 2 on top?  Jodo uses his hidden weapons to capture luke.  After you have wiped out their ground forces, use direct damage and force drains to kill them.  The drain potential is actually quite large, with Vigo&#8217;s and Presence OTF.  Your objective makes tracking easy, and makes Bossk with gun good again.  If they are playing space (ebo or HB), use resistance to limit their drains and use Search and Destroy and your objective to do damage.  Against HB, get out security precautions and find their base.  Watch out for fallen portal, and try to grab it.  Mid to late game the destinys in this deck become sickly high, easy to shoot and draw high in attrition.  Just beat him up on the ground.


Card Choices

Oh, Switch Off &#8211; You most dangerous characters in this deck are droids.  This is a used 6 destiny interrupt that cancels any attempt to steal, &#8216;hit&#8217; or make lost one of your droids. They are protected from such attempts for rest of the turn.   If they want to fallen portal Iggy or Guri or 4-lom, too bad.  Same if they want to swing at them.  Capture Ben with a droid and hold that in your hand so they can&#8217;t hit em.  Its killer, and no one will see it coming.  


3x Twi lek &#8211; You have valuable effects in this deck, helps you get em out fast, especially that early Bad Feeling Have I.  Plus a 5 destiny never hurt, and if you don&#8217;t want to pay to recycle them, put em back with your objective.  


3x Jabba&#8217;s through with you &#8211; this card is tits.  Add a battle destiny after your bounty hunter fired a character weapon&#8230;.used 5 interupt.  Why not play 3, always good to have in your hand.
