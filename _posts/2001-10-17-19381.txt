 This Deck is the Best I have played. I&#8217;m Sorry if it isn&#8217;t acceptable, but I have $12 to work on total per month. I myself dislike the fact that everyone must have the Emperor to be a good deck. I could have bought the Emperor before, but I don&#8217;t want to. Please rate this deck according to what you think is fair for a kid who has no money and does his best. 

Anyway, on to the stragey.

 This deck is a strong one. Most of the times I have played against Shaven Talz, I have lost. Like, 50 of 51 lost. Imagine, me winning by a large percentage over him on my first try with that objective.


Strategy

WYS- Take over the Cantina as soon as possible. Drain there and win the race. If you start fast enough, I see no reason not to win.

Profit- Put down Boelo and Boba w/ Blater for the objective. Get Watto and another guy at the Junkyard. If you have enogh force, put down a card at Mos Espa. Then, Put down a card for YAS. If they lose, move the character and try again later.

Echo Base- Do not try to take over Hoth. Focus on Tatooine. Put down Resistance instead of Watto’s Box, but fish for the Box too. This is the toughest matchup I have had. '
