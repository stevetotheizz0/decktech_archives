Resistance


You’re problem thinking, what a moron for playing a dumb objective like that, huh.  Well there are are enough ops counters out there to kill this deck, but when’s the last time you’ve seen that?  Ounee Ta is the only real threat.  Just play cool against that effect and you’ll be alright.


Go for a quick flip.


Keys to remember for the deck


Spread out and leave force to react.  It’s always cool to have speeder bikes at sites and other people there that can hitch a ride.


Put Mara, Vader with Stick, DR. E & Ponda, Xizor, and Guri on the bikes to ride shotgun.  Remember, only the pilot is power = 0.  The other characters gain the bonus of immunity of attrition < 4.  They can also react with the bikes.


Just keep enough force activated to react.


You only need enough operatives to flip.  The opponent’s force drains are now -1.  You get the benefits of an extra battle destiny when you have an op at the site.


High-Speed Tactics gain you another battle destiny.


Speeder Bike Cannon adds 2 to the power and can take out characters with Dr. E and Ponda.


Biker scout Gear makes your troopers have armor = 4 and immune to scramble.


Ree-Yees is cool in this deck .  There are 22 destiny 3 cards.  This will allow you to pump those up to a maximum of 12 when you draw a 3 for battle destiny.


The Circle is now Complete is a nice surprise on the opponent.


Review this deck with an open mind.
