Strategy: 

 
Use Prepared Defenses to start with Imperial Arrest Order, Mobilization Points, and then choose the third effect depending on what your opponent is playing. If you expect SAC then start 
TINT/OE, but otherwise start something else good. 

Starting the Game: 

Start by pulling a Docking bay and Rendili. Draw a few if your short on nessesary cards. Next turn pull another Docking Bay and Lay down Vader. Make sure to get him his saber early and show your opponet the true power of the force. 

Matchups: 

Mains(any type): Wait until youve tracked your destinys before you try to duel. WIth Luke and Ben dead their leftovers arent very difficult to kill off. Deal them the damage with Visage and If they come to space you can take them there also. Good matchup. 

WYS: These arent very popular in my area, but they are still very much worth mentioning. Control their sites and if they have Luke down Track and Duel. Drain at their sites and if an oppurtunity opens up kill them in space. 

EBO: Kill them if Possible with your ships and. If they send Luke down duel him. Not much envoled startegy just kill them. Not much to worry about because these are dead in my area, but a few still play them. 

Profit: Easy win duel them to death, and take over ther sites and drain. Kill han and this game is no problem. 

QMC: Never palyed against one, but just keep on Dueling and Win. If they go to the Bespin System you can take them there. 

Rebel Strike Team: Take the Endor system and drain. Duel luke and Obi if they come out. Beat them down at their weakest ground site and drain. Visage will kill their set up. Very tough, but if you outply your opponent you will win. 

Plan on Winning a Local Tourney with this on Saturday. (hopefully), but I could really use some advice. 

Thanks for Reading and Reviewing.
