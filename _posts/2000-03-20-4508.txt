Strategy: 

Usual start Coruscant, vs Hidden Base start Coruscant: Imperial Square. Drop Undercovers on his ground drain locations and drain and/or battle in space.


This deck once lost badly vs an alien deck with yarkora's. But what are the odds of encountering Yarkora :)

Some extra strategy:

IG-88 in IG-2000: Adds a destiny, holds passengers and is great for attacking weak points in space. If the opponent barriers or escapes you don't need to fear a beatdown.

I've Lost Artoo!:
	OMDH: Try to trap the Falcon on Alderaan. Most OMDH decks don't carry Alter.
	Hyperescape: Now they can't escape
	Or just stop a lone ship for a beatdown or an escaping Legendary Starfighter

Restraining Bolt: deploy on Probe Droid to get a second 5D6 or deploy on R-3PO for protection.

Boba Fett With Blaster Rifle
	Anti-Profit, anti-(Captain) Han

vs Speeders: A Bright Center + 5D6 should do it. Better play safe and deploy 5D6 or 'bolted' Probe Droid with an Undercover spy.

vs I Hope She's Allright, try to outdrain him or deploy massive to a site. If you're really afraid of this card try Knowledge And Defense.

vs Ewoks: Just place your Undercover on the drain 4 locations.
