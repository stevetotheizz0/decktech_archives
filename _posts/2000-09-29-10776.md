Strategy: '

Setup  Always start with No Bargain and
Oppressive Enforcement. The third effect depends
on the deck youre facing.

Pull out your ships, one by one and fortify
the Audience Chamber and then get Scum and villany
up and running.

Against space, use Search & Destroy - you have
to occupy three battlegrounds fast, because
of Honor. But dont go outside the palace, unless
you have a Ghhhk or Jabba and Ephant Mon.

After all you dont want to loose, because of
one beatdown.

Never let the opponent battle you - instead he
should be on the receiving end of a skirmish.

The Power of this Decktype is the immense
retrieval, so initiate all battles if possible.

If he deploys and you see a beatdown coming,
barrier him, hopefully discouraging him from
continuing with his plan.

If he is stupid enough to come to you, use
your Hunters and the evil Dr. to clear the field
and get a few captives to throw into the brig
for two force retrieval and later on feed them
to the Rancor.

Some drains, and the game should be yours.

Matchups 

Profit  Actually the best matchup, since
you will be battling on the same turf, and you
are getting lots potential meals for your little
darling, the Rancor.

Start Chall and Boelo as your two Aliens -
pull the Engineer to convert the Chamber and
use the ACs GT for Ephant Mon, discouraging him
from attacking and preventing Lando with his
axe, deployed.

From then on, get your Hunters out,  and try
to capture Han with Iggy to feed him to the
Rancor, which will pretty much end his game.

This is the only matchup, in which you will
start All Wrapped Up, because most Profit Decks
dont wait, to retrieve five or ten.

You have 4 Lom to deal with Ben, who is a major
pain in the ass, since he will usually have
the job of protecting Han.

If you have your captive and arrive at the
Rancor Pit, he will try to get rid of you.

Drop Bubo asap, so he cant move from the site
and is trapped. The GT of Rancor Pit already
prevents him from moving away, using You will
take me to Jabba now, dont forget that.

Use him to get rid of spies, too.

Use Battle Order and Sullust to drain for free.

With None Shall Pass, prevent early Lukes and
Bens, even the Massa can be a pain in the ass.

With OTE out, since this version has no alter,
Use first strike to initiate a battle at a site
with opposition, retrieve three, make him loose
one, then cancel the battle via projective
Telepathy.

Use some DD and Drains to finish this.

MWYHL  Use Search and Destroy early on.
Always keep a Barrier or None Shall Pass, in
case you play a test one or two - deck.

Try to get through as many drains as possible,
but watch out, if he isnt playing The Way of Things, Suprise Assault may be looking for ya.

Get Ships to Sullust to get by the effect of
Battle Plan.

Overall start with OE and Secret Plans.

Try to grab any On the Edges he throws and
use Projective Telepathy for AFA.

You can load up your ship with Hunters and travel
to Dagobah via Sullust to land there and battle
him, eventually sacking his apprentice, which
you can then transfer on to your ship and keep
in a safe distance in space. Still, you have to
include an a-4 character in your landing party
or Yodas GT will screw you up.

TIGIH  Try to get Search and Destroy up and
running. Start Battle Order to kill his early
drains. You may want to get to Endor, after he
has spread to capture some. Just beware speeders.
If thats what he is playing, fortify your
crew at the hut, his combat vehicles cant get
there. As usual get three BGs up to counter
HotJ . Use your DD and Drains - but beware the
Superfalcon once you get to space - a Barrier
early on and a follow up Lateral should deal with
this. Use Bubo on the ground to eat Boushh if
she or another non-droid spy decide to stall your
drain at the hut.

If he is not playing speeders, feel free to roam
at will, just dont be stupid and spread to thin.
If you run up against Close Air Support,
Try to kill his Z 95s .

You can use your Grabber to get hold of
Insertion Planning, if you feel they play it alot.

Most of this info applies to RST also, with the
additon, that RST is more heavy on Drains.
Try to capture Midge and Solo, who will cancel
a BD with any scout. watch out for I know -
this can get him the Daughter and Anakins Stick 

Hidden Base  Use S&D. Pull your ship early on,
but dont deploy until they flip, then immediately
probe. Get your retrieval engine up and running.

Beware I ll take the Leader and X - Wing Cannons.
Usually try to keep your ships together, especially after you have probed his base with
Security Precautions , since the battle damage
against you is up and running. With this, try
to get your Ghhk early.

If you run into a space-heavy variant, spread
on the ground, if you have barrier and
Ghhhk. You can use Coruscant to convert theirs.

Dont deploy Sullust though.

If he deploys Alderaan and Tattoine at the start,
fish for Secret Plans - this usually means
Our most desperate Hour.

Try to prevent his moving from Tattoine by
engaging him in battle several times. If he
deploys and tries to move the same turn to
Alderaan to retrieve, use Barrier.

Similar strategy vs. Kessel Runs, although if
this is popular in your area, you might want
to include an Alter or two.

Oh, use MastaMove to kill Savrip, Shut him up/down
for Bacta Tank and Operational as planned for
tracking / reactor terminal - tech in all games.

Have fun
