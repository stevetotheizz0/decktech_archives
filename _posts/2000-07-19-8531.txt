*********************************************************
I understand that this deck is not updated for recent expansions.  That doesn’t mean you have to rate this deck poorly.  Brian Hunter doesn’t get half-star rating for all his decks just because they’re old.  I’d expect the same courtesy.  This deck truly was made pre-ds2, rate it as such, and we’re working on an update.
Remember: Old=Gold.

Strategy:
   This is the best dark side deck. I have only played in one tournament, but in that tournament I went 3 for 3. My Wins were 25, 32, and 28. For
fun I play with friends and win almost all of the games I play, and I have played over 23 games.
   Okay start Security Precautions for more activation. If you have Crush The Rebellion use that instead. (I don’t have it) Duel who cares if it is against Ben Kenobi you will get 6 and 5 destinies most likely. Elis over to their site and duel, battle, and add destinies. Same if you are playing an air deck. Deploy Executor Tarkin, and Motti and add two destinies with Dark Collaboration, that will do some damage. The Dark Strike is for if you are in a battle w/ at least 2 guys and no Dr. Evazan swing and hit a person.
(It is not that hard) and lose a force and dark strike to trash that character.
Torture is to cancel numbers, point man is to cancel order to engage and other cards, while shut him up or shut him down is to cancel Death Star Plans and/or Bacta Tank!
    If you are playing a Profit deck for your starting 2 aliens use Mara Jade and Dr. Evazan. Search for Mara’s saber and then deploy it and a Darth Vader as fast as you can. If they deploy a boussh maybe a Ben Kenobi and they move out w/ Han then they flip the objective, all you have to do is elis to their site duel, battle knock some characters out w/ Dr. Evazan and make Han lost. This is an easy win for you. I played two games against a profit. I won with losts of force left over.
    If you are playing an EBO deck start Security Precautions, because you will probably not get that much activation in the begenning. All you have to do is deploy Vader to one of you sites as fast as you cn. Then deploy all of your characters on your star destroyers, like I said tarkin, and motti are a big combo w/ dark collaboration in your hand two high destinies can
make your day. You want to control the two drain of 5 systems kessel and
coruscant.You should win this game, but it might be a little harder than a normal ground deck.
    If you are playing against any Opperative deck all you need to do is go to their site and don’t allow them to flip I played two games aginst speeder ops deck and blowed them out by 33 and 27! They never flipped. The Elis Helrots become very useful alowing you to stomp them. I think it is the most underated card in the game. A very easy win.
    An EPP beat down deck is the most fun deck to play against because of it’s low destiny. So, all you have to do is duel obi or luke an place one
them out of play. I played against one of these decks and beat it by a lot. Any ground deck you should beat very easy. Air decks are a little bit harder to beat, but the light side will quake to Visage and to drains. . .
	Have fun and win a lot!!!!!
