Props Eric Hunter, Reinhold, the other people I apparently ”stole” this from or whatever


Oh, thanks people. I didnt know this was someone elses deck...


Deck credit from what I hear it is Eric Hunters. I didnt know about that until just now though. Oh well, I need to get better sources I guess. Loback only mentioned Reinholds name and not Hunters. And I was only posting it because Damian got banned from the site. Sorry though, didnt mean to spoil any secrets on anything. Maybe Damian forgot to mention it or Reinhold didnt tell him that. No hard feelings I hope.

 


Record 4-2

Average rating of opponents who beat me 2060.5


Seems fairly good to me...


After I went 1-3 at locals, a nice guy named Damian Loback from Georgia gave me a similar deck to this one for my regionals. He was real nice and even mailed me some cards I needed to borrow (ORS, Command, Proton Bombs). I changed the deck around slightly but its basically the same idea. You get out a fast Executor for free to Bespin and control space while using walkers on the ground. Use the Bombs vs. WYS, Senate, QMC, and LSC. Even if they use the shield, it still can win on the ground with a lot of power and limiting battle destinies. 


At regionals it went 2-1 with a loss to Pat Ziagos Profit. Then I took it to the NYC Miniopen and went 2-1 again with a loss by 15 to Brian Terwilligers Senate.


Early Game

Pull Executor with first action. Then pull Executor Docking Bay, get out Piett from Imperial Command, get him and Merrejk to the docking bay, and get out Bespin along with They Must Never Again Leave This City. Then get out the Executor, move them to the bridge, and fly to Naboo. Get out your other docking bays and set up your hand with stuff for battling. Set up Jonus with bombs and collapse interor sites if given the chance. 


Mid game

You should have some steady drains going and you can take out their space with Fel w/ Cannons or just your massive power. Virtual Vader is in here for some reason, I have never used him in space before in my life though. He was supposed to be anti-Ten Numb or something.  Imperial Command to limit destiny in space and Battle Deployment to limit on the ground. Trample anyone with ability <6. I have Trampled Lukes twice and many ability 4 characters. The destiny doesnt look like much but if you set it up decently, it can work. You dont need to flip right away. Get out the ISB droid to their planet and it usually sticks around awhile. 


Late game

You should win by draining out and getting back lost agents from lost pile.  Track around high destinies for battling. If necessary, get chased around on the ground, as long as you can still hold on.


There you have it. Heres a breakdown of cards


Mob points is good with the possible +2 activation bonus. That is why I dont use the combo. Hmm, simple enough.


Locations You get a solid drain of 4+ from your 3 battlegrounds.  Naboo is for anti-LSC. Spaceport is to put people out vs LSC to make their drain minus one.


Characters Chiraneau went in recently to help cause space damage and the rest are easy to understand.  Four ORS has worked fine plus thats all I have. Maul is tech vs. Han, Chewie, and the Falcon and helps sometimes vs. WYS.   


Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down Anti Bacta Tank and a six destiny 


Unsalvageable Anti Hyper Escape/Power Pivot and I hate Out of Commission


Matchups (with record vs)

WYS

Get out the quick Executor and set up with alot of guys in space. On the ground, set up with walkers and if you can, collapse the Cantina.  They cant drain for much on the ground and you can own space. Shoot down their guys and use Maul in ship. Imperial Command and Battle Deployment are huge in this game. 


QMC (1-0)

Possible first turn Executor which I did vs QMC. Control the system. Collapse their sites and put out the <> site to Naboo for a drain of 2. The cannons are big in this game. Virtual Vader is for Ten Numb, havent seen him in awhile though. Masterful Move combo against celebration if it comes out.


Mains (1-0)

Drain in space, barrier their stuff if you can, then beatdown. They cant drain for much and cant swing at walkers. If they chase you around with mains, run away. Watch for OTE. 


Profit (0-1 with loss by 11 against Pat Ziagos)

Drain big on their sites. Trample Han if he comes outside. Grab any SAC. Drain up in space. Sometimes hard but should be simple if its only the basic profit.


LSC (1-0) 

Collapse their sites and put people to the <> docking bay to make their drains -1. Control space and stop the H, C, F. Once thats gone, you should be able to drain freely in space. 


LS Senate (1-1 with loss by 15 against a Twigg)

Collapse the 3/0 site. Then drain in space and kill H, C, F. Use Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down to keep the recurring mains from killing off walkers. Hopefully drain on the ground for enough. 


Space

Kill off their guys in space and drain on the ground. This deck is fast in space and has good battling potential there.        '
