Strategy: 

My deck is pretty straight forward.  I love it, 
but it’s easy enough for a beginner to play.  
The deck’s main goal is to flip the Objective
first turn so you can start the hurt right away.
To do this, you can use Twi’lek Advisor to pull
a Presence of the Force out and flip the Objective
before you even draw your hand!  A Lightsaber on
the Dark Price will keep away the opponents while 
he and his Vigos move their way to Tatooine for
major force drains (Vigos add one apiece).  If
they put a Luke on the table (especially with 
There’s good in Him) plop a He is not ready on
him and wait at the Enor Landing platform for him 
with all those bounty hunters.  He may just choose
to lose the Luke!  Be sure to use Weapon of an
Ungrateful Son before that though, so he has no
chance in a fight with all your armed aliens.  Be
sure to put no Imperials down there (The Emperor
is the only one), or Luke will be captured.  If
they show no motivation toward getting a Luke out
and aren’t playing a There’s good in him deck,
then feel free to dominate with the hunters in 
their ships in space, there’s no stopping the
fearsome five.  If you can, run some captives
to the Dungeon!  This deck is pretty self-
explanitory, so just enjoy!
