Okay theres not realy much to right. Its EBO just get it up fast and drain like mad.
I would appreciate it if you could d-mail me with any quistions before you review with somthing stupid that theres a perfect reason for.

Against Huntdown
most huntdown decks will play 2 chiemeras 1 zuckuss and 1 bossk in ship [maby some variation of that]. Take out zuckuss with x-wing cannon power pivot bossk and chimera then just drain in space. If they dont start no escape get honor out asap cuase that will just win you the game so much faster. If they start no escape cancel visage loss with baragwin retrieval or transmision terminated.

Maul Hut Mains
slightly more difficult then huntdown cause of how fast it is. Its major downfall is lack of space just like huntdown. You will lose alot of cards early but by 4th turn you should be draining at somwere from 6 to 15 cards a turn plus you can retrieve with all wigns.

Big Blue
I have never played against it and dont expect to. I could guess that it would be a very good game. Power pivot is huge.

If you want to know how well it does against other decks d-mail me and ask.  '
