*responses to revievs*

-- Why DSII Wedge?

DSII wedge works well with Corran or Luke to cancel a destiny.  He is good for ground or space and the secondary function is just so cool.


-- 3 Harvests are plenty, not all the retrieval is meant to not be able to all be handeled at once, and by harvesting in activation phase, Tatooine celebration retrieves the Harvest every time.


--I am not intending on OMHD for 20 at a time...  so many methods there is little need for overkill.

I have tested this deck a bit, and I really like how it works.  The setup is simple hidden mains...  First turn pull Dagobah, Yoda’s Hut and Home One DB, General Crix and General Calrisian if you need some space worthy protection.  This is where my little bit of fun comes in.  Drop Crix and pull Geezum, put Geezum at the Tatooine DB with some protection and use him to pull the Farm and Cantina.  Now your drain sites are out and Alderan and Tatooine should also be deployed.  Start dropping characters to control your sites and begin the retrieval cycle using Tatooine Celebration, Harvest, Yoxgit and OMDH.  The destiny in this deck is average but not just wonderfully high (like it is in Mo Murder) the retrieval engine in this deck is crazy and the drain potential ain’t that either.


Mainly a reactionary deck, but I will post more strategy on it as I playtest it a bit more.  I think it is capible of competeting with most any deck out there.  Let me know what you think.
