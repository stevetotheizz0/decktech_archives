***** THIRD UPDATE *****

This is just to thank this deck´s latest review. I could erase bad ratings if I wanted. I usually try to answer suggestions on my updates (go on reading if you can). 

Dantes, your life must be sad.

***** SECOND UPDATE *****

Once more, thanks all for your reviews. Here are some new ones

--EXTERIOR SITES

Some of you ask me about get drained at exterior sites. Actually I cannot think of this hurting me too much. 

RST might be the main threat. It´s not popular in my area, anyway your strategy could be taking control of Endor (use as much force as necessary and never let them flip. Your retrieval will give you the edge.

WYS with Palace Riders don´t drain that much.

Agents could drain hard but you can collapse Audience Chamber killing Kabe and Tessek. They will be done.

I cannot think of any other threat. Please d-mail me if you find it. If problems with thdis add one Bombing Run and beat them down hard.

--CORULAG

You also claim to replace Corulag for Kiffex. This is a straight way to improve my drains and that´s great. The main reason to get Corulag is parsec. Corulag (parsec 4) is KEY so I can move my Dreadships all over the galaxy. Kiffex (parsec 2) is too far away.Using Corulag I get better flexibility.

--COLLAPSING

Yes, I can collapse interior sites since Proton Bombs target ”interior sites” and not especific planet or mobile sites.

--XWING CANNONS

Are you kidding? Overload them. Since they are destiny 5 it will be easy.

--RESISTANCE

Some of you prefer Resistance better than A Bright Center of the Universe. I usually do too, but huge drain modifier decks rely on one single system (I know EBO don´t).Example Operatives, they will drain you for two each(1+1), so Resistance will do nothing but ABCOTU will cut it in half.

--UNDERCOVER SPIES

Don´t use them. They can be shot and Corran will hurt. I know they´re awesome too but I´ve explained sevarl ways to cut ground drains.

--EMPEROR PALPATINE

HeavyArms ”a beat down against eppy would not be good”? Please read SYCFA. Iget NO battle damage, just attrition (and Palpy is inmune). If they play TIGIH just don´t deploy him.

--GRIMTAASH

Yes, this would hurt...as long as you keep a big hand. Grimtaash is not a popular as Monnok (specially the combo card). Feel free to add Well Guarded if you´re afraid of Grimtaash (you should get it fairly quick since you have three Twilek Advisors).

***** END SECOND UPDATE *****


***** FIRST UPDATE *****

Thank you all that think this deck is great AND those others who don´t agree and explain their reasons.

Rogue_5. Thanks for your ideas. I´m still trying to find room for ”I can´t shake him”. Undercover Merrejck is great but a bit difficult to set up. I prefer collapsing ground drains.

”You need more characters, otherwise ok. ”    luke w/saber.

OK. Do you really feel I need more characters? I´m packing 3xPalpy. Strat section explains why this character and the reason to have just him. Palpy is there to satify Battle Plan and get huge activation (very useful vs WYS). This is a TIE BOMBER deck. Not BHBM. More characters would just destroy my focus and I don´t want to kill my own characters while collapsing sites (that would be way too stupid).

”cool”          YOYOY.

Cool=poor rating?

***** END FIRST UPDATE *****


STRATEGY

First of all thanks to Assassin for inspiration and support. This deck is based on his TIE bomber deck.

Please read the whole strategy section before reviewing. You will probably find full explanation for all cards. Constructive critics welcome.

This deck uses classical TIE engine for retrieval/draining/battling but with bombers instead of interceptors/vanguards (pretty obvious). 

Set SFS to Wakeelmui as fast as you can and spread all over space. Most of you know quite well how to do this so I won´t bore you anymore. I´ll try to explain why bombers and not interceptors.

I realize bombers look like pure crap. They are. But just a few cards will make this bantha fodder starships on abslute killers. Planetary Subjugation is key for this. Your bombers are now the most versatile destinies on deck. Used wisely you can take advantage of both high and low destinies.

High destinies for battling and weapons, that´s what you wanted them for.

Low destinies annoying cards and effects.

These are some reasons for my cards

Planetary subjugation see above. Simply HUGE.

Palpy Take him to DS docking bay for extra activation and battle plan requirements (don´t use him vs TIGIH).

Scimtar squadron best bombers ever and help vs starfighters (concussion missiles)

Overload tech vs EPPs, sabers and X-Wing cannons. Since your bombers will be destiny 0 for overload you just kill those pesky characters.

 A Bright Center of the Universe usefull vs dedicated decks (operatives, etc)

Battle deployment great vs every deck using just starfigthers or capitals.

Concussion missiles sweet vs starfighters. DON´T put missiles on your Scimtar TIEs but use their cummulative bonus. You can get a +4 vs a starfighter, combined with high desnities can get rid of  any ship (even Superfalcon).

Proton bombs my favourite. Here´s the gamtext Deploy on a bomber.When present during a force drain may target a related interior site. Draw destiny. Site “collapsed” if destiny >4 OR….(I don´t use this).

I include glossary description for this
collapsed -- When an interior site is ’collapsed’ (e.g., by Collapsing Corridor), all cards at that site are lost and its Force icons and game text are canceled. The site remains in play for other purposes; however, each deployment or movement to or from that site requires 1 additional Force. A collapsed site is ’rebuilt’ if either player deploys a new copy of that site.
A ’collapsed’ docking bay still allows docking bay transit to that site, because the card’s title still indicates it is a docking bay. However, transit from the docking bay is not possible because the site’s game text is canceled.
I guess you all understand how powerful this can be. Example
Vs WYS. Take control as fast as you can of Tatooine system. Then collapse cantina and kill all those pesky smugglers and get rif of  their favourite place (no icons= no activation nor drain).
Another one could be Agents (blow up Kabe and Tessek on Audience Chamber) or most HB Mains decks (destroy their docking bays).
This is a powerful tool in your hands, and not a difficult one. The only thing you have to do is track any bomber and that´s it. Since it´s a WEAPON destiny, you can add 5.
Locations you may like to see more systems. Trust me, most times you won´t need more. Since you can get rid of lots of ground drains you´ll be winning most drain races (you drain and retrieve).In addition, most popular LS decks nowadays provide you with some systems you can use from the beginning.
Why not?
Merrejck I prefer Emperor for several reasons. It´s inmune to attrition so he can stand in frnt of a legion of Wookies and survive, blocking a force drain and activating more. Merrejk can bring your battleground systems but this has come to be not that important (see above). If you think you really need him just add it.
Vader no use. If opponent´s playing TIGIH you should not play anyone on the db. They would battle you every turn on the db and you´ll be stacking tons of cards.
Now for the match-ups
WYS You must take control of Tatooine. Battle until complete destruction of opponents starships (concussion missiles will help a lot). Then collapse Cantina and docking bay(s). If a Kessel version take control of Kessel. Kessel Run=Fun (bombers are destiny 0 = starship lost). Grab wisely and win.
HB Mains Blow as many docking bays as you can. Drain as much as you can and retrive like a champ.

HB Swarm Difficult match up. Don´t spread too much to avoid a beatdown. Get rid or their cannons with overload. Grab organized attack as soon as possible. Battle Deployment hurts swarms badly. Your retieval should give you the edge.

MWYHL Grab On the Edge and be patient vs Superfalcon. Use concussion missiles at maximum (with Scimtar TIEs) and hit it or use Overload with Leia. They can´t stay for long.

QMC Set up a strong force on Bespin and grab thair interrupts. Collapse as much as you can.

RST hard match-up. You can be faster and your retieval is unmatched by opponent. You´ll probably won´t be able to collapse anything. Taking control of Endor will be key.

EBO Set up as fast as you can. You WON´T be able to collapse them since Hoth sites will be shielded. You need to play carefully but speed and retrieval can make you the winner.

Agents Use your Tatooine system and collapse every single interior site. Spread, drain and retrieve.

I think that´s all. I´ve tried to show every single match-up I can remember. Please be constructive, let me know WHY do you think that way and the reasons for your bad/good rating. I post it to make this deck better.
