Strategy: '

I’ve heard I few wierd reviews in my day, but this one just takes the cake.

”...add more space, like the mellinium falcon.  then you can load up the superfalcon and...”

wow.  I mean, wow.  I would say Han, Chewie and Falcon count as a prett good superfalcon, and leia w/ blaster is in there, just in case u missed it.


Yes, I have thought about I hope she’s alright, and I want to add it, but I’m not sure what to take out.  


Drain races. ok. The only deck this has to worry about is ties in terms of drain races.  The only other legit (lol) space drain is SYCFA, and I can beat the crap out of that.  

Any drain deck other than ties will be answering to a rabid wookie coming down on top of them.  I will just go to their sites and drain from their sites.



Pretty much an all purpose mains deck. The only other effect I could start would be draw their fire, and if I did that I would give away that its a mains deck. Hopefully theyll set up for dagocheese or testing or something else,

but then get smacked down with a couple mains. 


First turn is just pulling a docking bay, yodas hut, and deploying yoda to his hut. 4 force gain right there. 


Next few turns keep yoinking out sites to up activation, try to get out thrown back so you can draw up a lot and throw back stuff u dont need. by turn 3 or 4 you should be about ready to drop and smack.  No training Area b/c its faster to pull out 3 DB and 3 dag sites than 2 DB and 4 Dag.  Also, the training area gives off an icon, so its a better force choke this way.


2 spies and jar jar let beatdowns be easier, and plenty of mains, destiny adders, and weapons make battling the most fun youll ever have (2 game garuntee )) yoda at his hut is much more valuable than it would seem, so many decks like hunt down have lotsa ones floating around, and yodas hut cancels it out right off.  And wookie strangle + R3 chewie + losing track can mean easy choke vader (Literally hehe )


the characters are pretty much self explanitory, just a bunch of high powered guys to beat up everyone else. there are 8 weapons/epps, so most battles should have at least 1 weapon. 


not enough space to beat a good deck, but enough to put up a fight. Falcon w/ pilots and spiral make up most of the rebels best. 


advantage is like the legendary starfighter of the ground. 


Mantellian savrip is just the god card. With dupes of several mains, putting up battle damage agaisnt high powered opponents like walkers is easy. I can get up to 9 battle destinies in one battle, which does add up after a

while... 



YMSYL 

Not an easy matchup if they get set up quickly. just make sure you have enough characters to hold the 3rd marker and commence beating. Their power can be a pain, but mantellian savrip takes some of the pressure off if battle damage runoff, keeping your characters alive. Also, chewies

caster can target vehicles, and ya know blizzard 4 is only armor 4... 


LTMTFM/ALWWHR (new combat obj) 

hmmm. this is the single worst matchup of all time. unfortunately, they have a slight advantage at the start, with a huge drain coming at you. Your best chance is to save up for a couple turns and drop like 6 or 7 characters

all at once with weapons to hit someone and beat the living daylights out of them. Really depends on who gets a a better hand and faster set up. Ive lost big time and beaten big time against this. 


DARK DEAL 

heh. this is the kinda deck that my deck is built to beat. they provide me with plenty of activation and battlegrounds to drain, I provide them with the worst loss they will ahve in a while. since I dont have anything better to do

than beatdown on a few guys, its not like Ill be letting them set up for a really long time... 


SYCFA 

Just take the Death star by force and drain at their own sites. try not to let them flip if you can. possibly beat down on a lone destoyer, han/chewie/falcon is good at that. 


HDADTJ 

Shouldnt be too hard. with 2 qui gons to flip the objective bac over and other mains to beat up on vader, maul and mara, hunt down is one of the better decks that actually shouldnt be that hard. 


TAT MAINS 

whether it be mauls site, court, or MKOS, it shouldnt be hard at all, seeing as the new R3 mains beat the crap outta everyone else. even the

new fett cant beat the whole beatdown squad all at once. 


SENATE 

hard game. try to drain at their sites, get out honor to reduce all their little

picky damage things like drains at the senate or the battle destiny canceler senator or whatever. if they put ANYONE outside the senate, beat the snot out of them. and wipe it up afterwards, that stuff gets nasty when it lies around. 


Thats about all the decks I can think of for now, tell me if you think of more. 


Thx
