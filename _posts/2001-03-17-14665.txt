Strategy: 

With this deck, I cant think of a light side deck that is a serious threat. Although this deck doesn&#8217;t get the auto wins over certain light side strategies, it is capable of beating anything, if you pay attention to detail. This objective is sick... i can’t wait for the ’booster’ card comming in the tatooine expansion
