Strategy: '

Scum decks are the dominant deck type in my area and I made this deck to combat them.  Everyone says Scum decks are auto-win against Profit, but this deck works very well against Scum.

   Ok, start Aim High every time.  If they play Rops or anything else with generic sites start Ounee Ta as well.  This is why I don’t start with The Signal.  Your opponent will most likely start off with Mara Jade and Xizor or Dr.E/Ponda.  This is not a problem.  

   Your first turn you’re guaranteed to activate at least 5 force and you’ll probably have a Tunnel Vision.  First, get Master Luke and Ben as soon as you can.  As long as they are not playing Bring Him Before Me then Luke and Obi will be able to take care of most of their scrubs.  Luke can choke someone with the very high destiny in this deck, and Obi can chop someone.  You’ll most likely crack their immunity and force them to forfeit somebody as well. 

   With aliens relatively low forfeit you can usually clear a site like this. You will probly use at least two of your Tunnel Visions by the time you free Han, so when you get them back you can use them to grab your site if you haven’t already done so. Once you free Han start Harvesting and doing the Cantina shuffle with un-cancellable drain bonuses from the Journal and Sabers. These drains, your Harvesting and the direct damage from the Objective will soon deplete the opponents Life Force. 


Now, on to specific cards and themes, which will explain much more strategey than I have here.


Tallon Karrde I am a firm believer that the better a deck’s destiny is, the better the deck is. Within reason, of course. So here is a destiny 3 character with good text that boosts EPP Han’s forfeit and defense value, making him signifgantly harder to hit with a blind shot. It does the same for Chewie.


Sense/Alter I have noticed the decline of anti-Sense/Alter for quite a while now and I decided it was time to let these incredible cards see action again. I don’t have to tell you all the awesome things you can cancel with these, so I won’t.


Why so few sites? I can grab them with Tunnel Vision and these sites are all I need for large drains and retrieval.


Why no space? First of all because i simply don’t have room, and second, it’s not really needed in the deck. It does excedingly well against all decks.


Why so many interrupts and so few characters? I hate having a low destiny deck, so I use only the best characters to accomplish my goals. With all the interrupts I get high destiny and am able to pull whatever I need with Tunnel Visions.


Yoda Stew You can activate psychotic amounts of force in the mid-game while setting up easy tracking and giving yourself protection from Monnok.


What if something gets grabbed? Well, with so many of your interrupts being played if one or two gets grabbed it really doesn’t matter, because if one or two get grabbed it doesn’t crush your deck. This deck doesn’t rely on any one card.


I am incredibly tired right now, so if you have any questions please d-mail me before you give me a crappy rating. Thanks for your time

To clear up some very confused people’s reviews.


Garion If you had actually read the strategy you would know why I start HFTMF. It’s because that way if they are playing Rops or something I can start Ounee Ta as well.
