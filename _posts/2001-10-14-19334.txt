Strategy: '

Strategy 

well, it’s a hidden base deck, and this decks always work alone, their is no huge 
stratgey or tactic. First before you activate any Force search for General Calrissian, 
the best hand will be if you have Nien Numb on the hand, then deploy him with the Gold
Squadron 1 to Rendezvous Point, if you have enough Force deploy also General Calrissian,
of course the first system that you pull out is always Endor, then move the Gold Squadron 1
to Endor, just try to pull out some system fast, with only 2 ships, with some Red’s.
Then flip the Objective, now the opponent must come to space, if he starts to deploy his 
ships, pull X-Wing Laser Cannons with the Admirals Order and some ruf X-WINGS. 
If you have some problems at sites, pull out the EPP mains, perharps you can play a Leia
With Gun instat of Boushh. Well try to control Kessel, and try to keep always a ship with
Cannon at Raltiir so you can react to a battle. 


Thx to all who rate my deck, and if you have some awesome new ideas, tell me.
