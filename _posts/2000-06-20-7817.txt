Strategy: 



Ok, well get Vader down as quickly as possible. Begin draining, and battling. Your high destinies should be able to overpower your opponent.  I guess I'll go ahead and go into spec. on certain decks:

Speeders:
I'm using only interior sites, to protect myself.  Be sure to drain in space.

Numbers:
1 Torture, plus Resistance should be enough.

Profit:
Start Mara Jade and Dr. E. Get Mara's saber down first turn, and you should be able to make them lose one of their characters immediately, (Dr. E operates). Just battle continually, and make sure you have the drain of 2 up in space at Kashyyyk. Destiny, will be the dirfference in a win, or loss.

Ops:
Get ABCTTU out ASAP. Beat down, with your characters.

Revo:
Well I've never seen a Revo deck, where I play, but just in case I've packed one Evader. That should be plenty, with Crush The Rebellion.

Rescue The Princess:
Stop the droid with Restraining Bolt, cancel Cell 2187, with This Is Some Rescue!  Not many RTP decks are using I'm Here to.... because they can have their spy captured.  By then, you'll have the objective, flipped, and can move to the Death Star, to just protect the flip of RTP.  If they do get it flipped, drain in space, and dont be afraid to battle.  You can also use Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down to cancel their key game plan...retreiving with Death Star Plans.

Massassi Base Ops:
Dont help them out, by deploying Death Star.  Once they've flipped beat down on Yavin.  Use your starships to your advantage...not theirs...

After reading this strategy, you've probably realized that this is a defensive hunt Down deck.


Well, I guess that's it. Thanks for reading!
