UPDATE: THURSDAY AUGUST 9, get rid of the damn useless Death Star, it’s crap against WYS, and add the Cantina. MUCH more effective this way, you can actually generate FORCE! Wot a concept!

Sorry about the HTML tags, you’d think writing this in Notepad then pasting online would circumvent that nuisance, but apparently not.

Paul Myers sent me his version of this deck, which I basically just tweaked my original to include the best parts of his, and added the UC spy. It’s 10 cards different, not 5, Paul.


Start: (9 cards on table)
Hunt Down
Med. Chamber
Holotheatre
Visage Of The Emperor

Almost always start Watto’s Box, unless you’re playing against a WYS podrace deck that you absolutely know will win the race. Against that, start Secret Plans. Masterful Move for the Holotable ASAP, get a hologram there to start draining. Hold one Holonet Transmission in hand for the pesky Trans. Term. that you will see in 9 of every 10 light decks, and EVERY WYS deck.

Against a dedicated racing deck you’ve got the 4 Pod. Collisions, Unexpected Interruption to go fetch one, No Escape to grab one back after you’ve played it, and a Twi’lek to get THAT. This, and grabbing Too Close for Comfort, will help you win the race if you need to.

If they don’t try to win the race and are saving force, they’ve got It Could Be Worse in hand. Hold off on winning if possible until you have Ommni Box/It’s Worse in your hand. If you’re playing against a SAC deck, try to be flipped so they can’t Sense your OB/It’s Worse. Vader can cut any Jedi with the sick destiny in here. If they Blaster Deflection, try again next turn, they’ve only got ONE.

If they do It Could Be Worse the damage and you can’t prevent them playing their Sense(s) then just It’s Worse for about half the force you have activated, let them Sense that one, then do it again with the other It’s Worse for the other half of your force pile. Only a deck with like 5 Senses and crappy destiny will take no damage from the race.

After the race is won, and they’ve lost their 11, you have a couple strats against different decks. Okay, it’s the same against almost every deck. Find your dueling cards, slay (or cross) an Obi or Luke, respectively. Find your ships, take over a system. Maul controls a scrub-occupied site, Mara gets in the cracks where nobody else can go (Throne Room, War Rooms, etc.) Emperor sits at a high-traffic site, preferably with backup and zaps the sh!t out of anyone foolish enough to come near.

Are they out-activating you with a load of Revos? Image of the Dark Lord in a key place.

Not sure if they have dueling protection? Or just paranoid about that one card they keep in their hand? Take a peek w/Monnok.

This deck is great fun because not only can scrub smugglers not keep up (shut up Girard!), the Jedi have a hard time as well.

Okay I guess this is where I should explain my loss to Girard’s Watch Your Phil deck. I won the race, I crossed Luke, I was flipped most of the game. I got the bastard down to 7 life force. Then the Lars Family and their friendly Palace Raider decide to kick my ass. I never saw No Escape this game, so Honor prevented 2 from the race, 2 from the duel, and every force drain at the Holotable except ONE. Also, with my force generation cut, I couldn’t draw enough to find Maul OR any of the 3 ships. But if I keep whining, he’ll call the Waaa-mbulance, so that’s how I lost to him by 32. The next day in a friendly rematch game, he didn’t get Honor out as quickly, and I beat him by 27. So the deck has difficulty sometimes but it’s not an auto-loss against Watch Your Phil, or any other stupid WYS deck. I might just have to add another Twi’lek to get No Escape earlier. F*cking Honor Of The Jedi. I love/hate that card.

So there you go, race, duel, have fun, and don’t forget to drain at the Holotable.
