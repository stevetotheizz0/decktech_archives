Card Choices


Xizor- Fits very well with with the overall theme and focus of the deck. 


Best combo- Xizor+Guri+Chokk+Watto= a securely held junkyard and the opportunity to drain your opponent continuosly.


E-3P0- Works very well to neutralize threepio with his parts showing and R2-D2s nasty game text.


U-3P0- Should be in every dark deck ever made.


P-59- Lets face it, this card is nearly broken. Permanent weapon, direct damage, AND immunity to attrition? Oh I forgot, a DROID that can force drain and draw battle destiny.


Best combo- Dr. Evazan & Ponda Boba+P-59 = 2 points direct damage and a character removed from the battle. 


Second combo- 4-LOM+P-59= a useless dead character for the opponent.


Bounty Hunter Ships- Lets face it, any scum deck that wants to hold space by committing as few deck slots as possible to the concept has to use these ships.


Best combo- BH ships+Lateral Damage+ Imperial Decree= a powerless LS ship and canceled drain modifiers. A perfect way to begin a beat down.


Security Battle Droids- They control and drain, they inhibit opponents movement, and thier destiny isnt that bad for what they are.No more last minute Jedi Escape to flee from Maul dueling Qui-Gon or one of the other jedi off the table anymore.


Begin Landing Your Troops-Boosts forfeit and increases activation by pulling docking bays. Added bonus there is it takes a zero destiny draw out of your deck. Plus it doesnt inhibit Elis Helrot.


Mauls Electrobinoculars- Allows you to stack your important destiny draws before hand. Irreplaceable in a tight game.


Matchups-


QMC- This could be a tough one if your not careful. Flip quickly to get the direct damage going to supplement your drains. Elis over when you have a sufficient beat down crew to take a site away from your opponent. Try to have this done early to keep them from flipping their objective and utilizing KTEOF.


WYS- Work on controlling your opponents key sites and there shouldnt be too much of a problem. On average you have 10 more deployable characters in the deck than they do. So do your best to keep the pain coming and never let up. Remember to drain and stack your destinies to kill their smuggler doing the Kessel Run. Keep them flipped to 0 as much as you can.


MWYHL- Spread out and drain while you can. Keep up early drain pressure and watch out for Honor Of The Jedi. Worse case scenario is you have to fly over to dagobah to take out the new jedi.The podracing variant will be loaded with jedi, so beware.


TIGIH- Use that activation thing to your advantage and deploy Maul free to endor to take out madine and Jedi Luke early. Other than that keep the pressure on them to try to deal with you taking up thier property. Elis is your best friend in this deck.


Profit- Keep the pressure from the starting. Chokk and Xizor at the audience chamber to start will definitely make your opponent reconsider a visit to the palace any time soon. Get flipped fast to help set up for continued drains and battle damage for the opponent throughout the game.


EBO- Keep up the 2 every turn and your drains. These two decks dont react very often. They usually become a drain race where the only real fighting that occurrs is in space.


Hidden Base/Hidden Mains-Space here will be hard to deal with. Control the ground and save your ships for him to spread out to drain you, then deploy them with the aide of your objective and proceed to massacre thier unprepared forces. Mains on the ground are dealt with by heavy beat down.  '
