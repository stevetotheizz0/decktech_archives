Strategy: '

The basic strategy of this deck is to get Vader with his stick down and drain. Use IAO to get a db each turn, go to them with walkers and drain. If they try to attack you, which they will because you are draining them of 7+ each turn, use interrupts such as Release Your Anger and I Have You Now (with Vader) to draw extra destinies. Use Presence to deploy on a location (usually the back door, I don’t know why) for extra drain there. The basic strategy is to drain and have a lot of power. This deck won 2 games in a tourney and helped me get 6th out of 18, with some really good people there. Against all decks its pretty much the same, EXCEPT for QMC. Against this deck, DON’T deploy Vader to a DB like normal, but put him at a CC site with other people, this was the big mistake I made in this decks one loss, which allowed my opponent to get massive drains on me which won the game for him.
I hope you like it,
