Strategy: '

this is the MOST EXPENSIVE DECK EVER BUILT  kneel before it’s cash value  i originally made this deck as a joke...but somehow it worked, and it worked WELL  whoa.  it’s also been published in scrye for an article i wrote about a year or so ago.  at first glance you’ll say "what a pile," but then you’ll look at it again and you’ll be like "that’s an L5R deck"


so anyhooo...


basically you sit there and gain honor.  if they attack you, you say "tactician" and they say "and then?" and you say "BOX" and they say "and then?" and you say "WEDGE" and they say "F UCK"


and then you win because their whole army is dead and you gain like...20 honor....and then you counterattack and destroy them by military as well.  great.


everyone come to Normal and play L5R and Counterstrike w/me and joe on our LAN


go eat a crab   '
