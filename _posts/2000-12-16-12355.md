Strategy: '

This deck rules as I found out today.  It won by 37, 27 and 11 in the 3 games it played with the win by 11 coming against a MKOS deck that owned tosche station the whole game.  Basically, like all other tosche decks, try to get obi-wan down 1st turn and move him over for mad turn 2 activation.  other than that  it’s a classic Mains deck, just play reactively, use the Savrip to keep the Battle damage down and the Capitals and Squids to lock down Tatooine for the celebration.  The monks allow you to drain for tons and the lightsabers are in there for beatdown city with luke or leia.  if they are playing space, just sread out and drain for bunches.  You should wreck every time.  I am not going to do a deck-by-deck breakdown because it should play about the same.  All I will add is against BHBM give him luke and against HD beware of dueling.  I didnt include dueling interrupts because if the DS player built and played their deck right they should be able to beat you anyway, so keep Ben and Luke off the table or at least away from Vader.  Any suggestions for improvement are appreciated, but I ask for constructive criticism. Insults are unnecessary and unappreciated.

Thanks,

-Brian '
