Strategy: '

Deck works pretty well so far.  Has a huge potential to battle ecspecially on tatooine.  Retrieval is strong.  And lots of draining capacity.  It may suffer early with generation so if you can get out panno or toche station early thats great, and i was thinking of adding the Admiral order that allows for cheaper deploy for non pilot warriors.  And it can be difficult for the enemy to hit tatooine in mass with characters like Kensaric and H'menethe plus goo nee tay and tala 2 in the air.  Usually start with inssurection, sqaudron assignments, and strike planning. Searching is key so make sure you search for something every turn wether it is a docking bay, scout, general, or sqaudron assignment.'
