Strategy: 

Just to let you all know, I’m a begginer. I’ve played in one tourny and got 11th out of 18. This is Supposed to be a fun deck, but it can win.

      The overall statagy is the Spread you forces and force drain for a ton. Admiral Chiranu helps alot. Arica is in there if the are playing a ground deck. No Escape helps if they’re playing The honor of the Jedi. so you can get that +2 or 3 bonus from the death star. 

Moff Jerry- to get the sites out right away
Admiral Chiranu- Force drain bonus
Vader- in case they don’t have a ground deck either can  pick up a drain
Arica- undercover
Thrawn- one of the best SD caps out there
Pelion- can make superstar destroyer better than executer
We’e in attack position- makes all my piloted sds better
Godhert- gets one more hyper for thunderflare or executer.


Any tips would be appreicalted.
