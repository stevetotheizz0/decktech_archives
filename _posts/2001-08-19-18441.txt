Strategy :

This deck uses No Money, No Parts, No Deal to do two things : deploy characters for free, and recycle destiny while inflicting force loss.

1st turn, Deploy the Sail Barge and the Passenger Deck(and a docking bay)
2nd turn, Deploy Watto + another character[Ephant Mon], and someone else with ability 4 to Mos Espa. Use the objective to recycle a high destiny.
3rd turn and on, repeat and fortify.

Continually use the objective to take the place of a Reactor Terminal, and make sure the Junkyard and Mos Espa are secure.

A weakness may be in space, however, the small fleet in the deck helps, and Security Precautions + Executor can save the day easily, as can the bounty hunter ships. Executor is nice for a possibly free deploy with the objective.

Against Podracing, the multiple destiny 7’s in the deck should win the race. If not, Secret Plans will hamper it.

This is a fun deck to play, and will generally win the game for you.
