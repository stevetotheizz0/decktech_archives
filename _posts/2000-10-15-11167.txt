Strategy: 

This is my first shot at a deck post, so I’m open to some constructive critisism.

First off, I feel that starting Operational as planned is just insane, your opening turn will go absolutely nuts.  Something like this:
Drop DSII, and drop Desperate Counter on that.
Use Desperate Counter to go get IAO and use the IAO to bring out DS:II docking bay.
Drop Jerry at the docking bay, go get the coolant shaft and play it, otherwise, grab another sector and try to draw up.
Get the DSII operational 3-4th turn, then use Mianda and Hebsly to shoot down any of your opponents ships that get into the sky.
Vader, Tarkin, Iggy and the walkers should allow you to hold down a battleground site somewhere if need be, otherwise, drop Kashyyyk and dominate there...
If opponent gets out Honor, don’t panic, just hold down troops on the landing platform, and spread out your star destroyers and TIE’s to cover Kashyyyk and Endor.
Let the DSII do the rest (add battle destiny, cost opponent force, transport ships)

Any helpful tips would be appreciated.
