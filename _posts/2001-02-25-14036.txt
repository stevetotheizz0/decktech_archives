Strategy: '

BHBM These decks cause no probelms, well not yet.
When you begin pull out your two generals (solo and crix) and then put them as well as whatever else you can for the amount of force you activate.
be sure not to lose any battles and allow them to take luke to the throne room. after you win a few battles cross vader and there you go. just dont let them control the skies, get out the admirals order and make the attrition hurt them bad.

COTVG/ISEWYD play it right and this is an easy win. make sure to control the space systems put out. also get menace fades working on there drains so you can drain them and have no probs. take the win and shove it in there face.

Endor Ops play as BHBM but stack up andthem move around with your ships or they might get pumped.

Othersmake sure to control endor and the skies and you will win big. '
