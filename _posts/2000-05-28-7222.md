Strategy: '

Start will allways be Uh-oh To free Han, set up Bo shuda and Order to engage.
The high destiny average means you can do nearly everything without tracking.
Against epic duels, watch out when they set up destinies. If they dont set up something, feel free to attack, your chances of winning an epic duel are quite high.

The two weaknesses you will certainly point out 

1. Low activation
Its true, I only generate 5 force myself and cant get anything else. But if they dont give me force, they cant damage me. And the whole stuff is really cheap, apart from the bacta tank and the EPPs. If you want to add something I would suggest the hologameboard first, then rendezvous point and yodas hut. But dont complain, if you draw them for destiny

2. No ships
Against an all space deck with resistance I would say, yes, no chance. But then every deck got its weakness and you dont see that kind of deck very often.
Else you have bargaining table and the inserts. Try to loose from hand as often as you can so you wont waste an insert. With Luke and force is strong with this one you can take out Vader and Tarkin or pretty much everything they put on the ground so they have to pay for Battle plan. '
