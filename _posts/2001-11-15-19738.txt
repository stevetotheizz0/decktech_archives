Strategy: 

Note: The * means that these 10 cards do not count towards my Deck Count.

Second Note: This deck is only made out of cards I have. So, sorry I do not have Coruscant Mauls to make it kick major whoop-ass and all the other cards I need to make the deck work.
-The 10 Shields I have, ARE THE ONLY shields I have.

Now for the strategy:

Win the Podrace. After you win the podrace, you should retreive all the few cards you might have lost from force drains up to this point.

After winning the Podrace, make sure you control the senate. Actually, you should be able to flip your objective first or second turn depending on your draws. Hope you get a Lott Dodd in your opening hand. Because basically the whole senate objective revolves around him.

You active 5 Force by yourself first turn. This is with the opponent giving you none. This allows you to deploy usually 2 Senators. So, make sure you can attempt to flip {hoping one of those senators has a blockade agenda}. 

The new LS Objective gives you 4 force from itself. This will give you a starting 9 force base. Meaning, First Turn, 3 senators. Which, hopefully will be: Orn: Dodd: Toora.

Toora helps in case in battle.
Lott Dodd is the freken law.
Orn is only 1 force.

I have tried this deck against Drew Scott’s LS Profit deck. It went, the first time: Loss: -13. Second time: Loss: -10. Third time: Loss: -8.

So, overrall, it does play fairly well against pretty good players.

Please be fair in the reviews. 

Thanxs.
