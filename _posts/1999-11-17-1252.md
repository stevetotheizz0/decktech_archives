Strategy: '

   This deck is fairly simple to play and has proven Quite Popular and deadly.  I like the Cloud City theme(rather than the Tatooine version)
the best,there are way more advantages.For one thing there's no exterior sites(e.g.no walkers),
plus Path of Least Resistance is way stronger than Nabrun throw in Insurrection and you are hurting their transporters while yours are still
as deadly.  You don't want to even try to fight in space so just hook-up and relax as you keep retrieving those canceled claws with Yoxgit.

vs.Hunt Down. Visage is an advantage to you and beating up on Vader and his pals shouldn't be that much of a problem.

Anything else shouldn't be a problem.

Enjoy
