Strategy: 

Okay, I suppose it's some pretty obvious strategy. Standard ROPs stuff, with a few fun things thrown in.
Imperial Command- Use these to fish out the Commanders and stuff, or to keep Super Falcon from smacking you.

WIAPN- My personal favorite Admiral's Order. Not only does it beef up your Destroyers, but it also acts like your very own Ralltiir Occupation. Fun!

Desert- No one in their right mind goes into a desert, because there could be a sandwhirl coming. Even though I don't have one, no one will know that.

Basically, against most decks, don't deploy until you're ready to flip (2-3 turns). Just occupy the DB's and build up force. Then flip and fortify your sites. Your opponent will basically have to come to you. Well, if you have any constructive criticism, feel free to review.
