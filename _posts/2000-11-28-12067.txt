Strategy: '

Well start 3 efect and draw Etablish a new secret base.... If you got a girlfriend I sugest you make her sing *1* a new secret base... its tech

if you suspect sac, start do or do not, wise advice and insurection. if you suspect space, witch wise advice and do or do not for batle plan and squadron asignement... well just use your brain 

The big advantage of this deck is that you dont put alot of card on table .... and you retrieve...

Well game plan against all deck are about the same... try to set ebo with baraguin and ishi tib. drain in space and try to kill on ground, then retrieve with On the edge

I am not sure, but I think the version I play at D0Con ad 3 on the edge... anyways I only have 2 in japanese, so I play with 2...

tech combo against SAC  when they SAC something you want... track it and draw it with Ishi tib on your next turn...

always put the war room next to the docking bay , in case of responsability of command. that lost me a game at D-Con.

I dont know about this deck now... but at world, it was good enough... it was really eating easily any slow deck... just ask Kyle Craft... and doing ok against fast deck like bring him and HDADTJ... the game was base on who is the most lucky

I will add strategy later, but I am tired now... well its a good deck	'
