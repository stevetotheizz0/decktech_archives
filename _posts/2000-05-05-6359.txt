Strategy: 

OK, just to clear things up, the original idea for this deck was mine, and Tarkinsaide made some nice improvements(not all of which I used, so this is NOT a repost!!!!) and I decided to put up my own modified version.
We worked on this deck together, it was a team effort.

On to the Strategy!

Obviously I want to get out Uh-oh, Tessek, and the non-unique aliens.  The basis of this deck is draining.  There are 3 signals to help get out the important effects.
Rebel Barrier and Ke Chu Ke Kukuta help block enemy deployment.
Activation is not a problem, as Tessek and Arleil reduce non-unique deploy cost.  All sites except the desert are either 2-1 or 2-0
Rendezvous point and Yoda's Hut are in for activation that does not allow their drains
Possibly this deck's greatest asset is the destiny.  The destiny average is a little over three, and when you take out 3 starting sites and nothing else at the beginning, it goes up more.  30 cards (yes I said 30  T-H-I-R-T-Y)have destinies of 4 or more, and several more have 3's.  This is especially fun with suprise assault hehe:)
Bo Shuda protects Tessek while at the AC, Rennek is Bubo protection:)
Scramble keeps pilot ability (for them) out of battles
No starships in this deck because they take up much needed room and are unesessary.
Barginning table cancels drains
Traffic control recycles high destinies
Most interrupts are used, so the destiny is recycled
I don't need Yarna b/c the non uniques get out pretty fast for the most part.
I only have one Ke Chu b/c there is a chance I won't be able to use it if I have a rebel at a JP site

 Against Hunt Down
the sabers
the high destinies
Trans Terminated
Courage of a skywalker
beatdown with eloms
Talz goes for hit characters
Boushh can get on Executor

 Against Ralttiir ops
OK this can be hard.
This is a drain race.  Getting Tessek and Non-uniques out is critical.
Small elom and main beatdowns against those non unique imps at the beginning can be fun, helps prevent flipping too
This is where suprise assault is fun - you don't even have to battle

 Against Court
A Gift
Bo Shuda, Uh-oh, Tessek, and Rennek
Master Luke
WHAAAAAAAAOOOOW! is so funny to use if they tried to eat you

 Against Inserts/odds
Ultimatum
Eloms have high destinies
So does Artoo

 Against CC
Drain race
main beatdowns
I don't really worry about it that much, these decks never have posed a threat ot me, I have never been beaten by one.



OTHER POINTS
Sense and alter- enough to be a pain to opponent, not enough to win a war
Skiffs react
Nar Shadda retrieves
Nar Shadda, YWTMTJN and Arleil all help get out aliens
Insurrection to prevent Elis beatdowns

That's 'bout it folks, plz rate honestly because I have a tourney tommorow
