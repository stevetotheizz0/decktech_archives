Strategy: '

The main focus of this deck is to stay on Endor, drain and blow away the Bunker. Use Midge at a site and put someone of  ability >2 at each site, except where Wuta is and drain for a bunch. Get the Explosive Charges and blow away the bunker. Don’t interfere with their decks, and just sit back, build up power and drain. Against all deck this is the same, except RalOps and Operatives. Against these decks, use all of your scouts and attack their planet. Ounee Ta helps them deploy for free (most of them) and makes me generate more force. You must keep their objective on the 0 side and you will win.

Hey spira this deck does have a woman-DOS She’s a pretty good one too 

I must blow the bunker away because otherwise they would just deploy to a Endor system, drain for one the whole game, and my objective couldn’t flip.  '
