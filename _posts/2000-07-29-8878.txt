Strategy: 

Obviosly, you want to get your docking bays out as quickly as possible. So start by, first turn, getting DSII: Docking Bay and putting the Emperor there (I know most decks do it like this, but it works). Next you want to get out the Endor: Landing Platform and then get Vader there ASAP (draw up if you need to). Then Vader can just wait for Luke, drain for 1 (two if you add Vader's Lightsaber) and make them lose for Your Destiny. If it looks like they're playing Honor of the Jedi and no Luke, feel free to move Vader around and drain at one of the other Endor sites (they're all battlegrounds and are all drain of 2).
If it looks like the LS is playing space (or sometimes even if it doesn't), use Mobilization Points to get Exeecutor and start beating them down in space. We're In Attack Position is in there for a couple of reasons: 1. Destiny of 6, can hardly go wrong there; 2. It doesn't have any penalties; 3. It can get rid of your opponents' possibly harmful AO; 4. Chimaera and Executor both become immune to attrition <7 and <14, respectively, because most of the pilots in this deck are leaders; and finally, 5. If you have this out, occupy Endor, and have Igar in Tempest 1 on Endor, they have to lose 1 force per turn.
One final note: I Am Your Father can be a big pain in the ass for the LS if they're not using jedi Luke and try to send Luke at you.
