Strategy: '

With in 3 turns I have out EBO. Now start deploying in space. It really helps if you have Datooine out -3 captial starships -2 starfighters. If I don’t have it, I pull out Mon Cal -2 star crusiers. If I have a signal in my hand the first card I try to get is Lauching The Assualt, it brings into hand Home One and adds +1 force drain where you have a piloted crusier. Depending on what I am playing the next card I try to get is Menace Fades or Goo Nee Tay. On the ground i try to put Obi-wan/ stick on 4th marker with lightsaber proficiency and/or luke with his stick out there. I also try to get who ever else is on ground (usely Wedge and Hobbie) on to a ship. If I can I try to put some  undercover spies out ASAP. I have been thinking about getting rid of the undercovers and adding some more cards like Rebel Barrier and Rebel Fleet. I also am thinking about getting rid of Falcon. Even though it is a 9,7,6 card and it’s immune to attrition< 5, gets 2 destiny draws, and forfet 21 with Han and Lando aboard. The landing claws work great, because ”if you can’t beat’em join’em” or at least on them. 


I don’t have Zev that is why he is not in here. When I get him i’m gonna dump Harc Seff and I have Dash Rendar in my deck not Biggs.


Most of you are wondering why i used A-wings instead of the good old X-wing. 2 reasons, the first is everybody uses x-wings i’m sick of seeing them. The othere reason is, most of my friends(including me with my Endor Ops deck) that have decks based around space use dread-naught crusiers and tie interceptors. One crusier with 2 ties fighting aginst an x-wing = power 15 and a d-draw. A-wings keep them from getting that extra +1 and if they are useing tie defenders a-wings reduce there power by 1 because they have the higher maneuver.


I’m new to Decktech {my 2 day as member) so if i forgot to write something please don’t give me a bad review. Unless you think my deck sucks, at least then you gave it a bad review for a good reason.
