Strategy: 

SCIMITAR SQUADRON TIES ARE DESTINY 7 WITH PLANETARY SUBJUGATION! THEY ARE IN HERE ONLY TO BE DEPLOYED AND THEN LOST TO THE USED PILE!

Sorry about that. It seems that I just have to say that loud or no one realizes it.

UPDATE- For all the people who are wondering why no Hyperspace Transportation, it’s because the Scimitars shouldn’t be on the table long enough to do anything. They are in here solely for their destiny, and then either as forfeit from a DB or to cycle them with the Asteroids. Oh, and for retrieval. Also, for those less educated, the Scimitars are destiny 7 when using Planetary subjugation. Oh, and for Weezer411 or whatever the hell your name is, go to hell. I deleted your stupid review and urge everyone who reads this to tell him how much he sucks for giving a half star review for no reason.

Okay, I know what you’re thinking. Scimitar squadron TIEs? WTF? Well my friend, you see, with Planetary Subjugation and SFS, suddenly I have a destiny 7 that can retrieve 1 force when it’s deployed, go to used pile when it’s lost, and can be deployed at a dorking bay to be lost for forfeit in a ground battle. See? Deviously useful. Now, on to the strategy. Most of the cards in here are self explanatory.

Vs. MWYHL- The key here is to cause enough damage before he can complete his tests. Difficult, but not impossible. Use Sim’s ability to mess up his tracking (great when he finishes Test 5!) Keep your retrieval going with the asteroids, and drain as much as possible, along with S&D. There really aren’t any drain modifiers to worry about. If farmboy completes Test 5, things are gonna hurt, though. Make sure it doesn’t happen.

Vs. TIGIH- Well, another relatively tough matchup. DO NOT LOSE BATTLES! Track some sevens, then go for the beating. Capture Luke if necessary, but whatever you do, don’t let Luke cross Vader! Actually, now that I think of it, that’s pretty freakin’ obvious.

Vs. WYS- Watch out for interrupts from the lost pile. Keep your retrieval going and watch for a beatdown chance. Try to slow down their retrieval (whether with Celebration or Harvest.) Play it smart, and watch out for Fallen Portal. If it’s a Harvest deck, try to take over the farm.

Vs. EBO- Might be a tough one. Send your walker to Hoth, keep your retrieval going, and see if your opponent spreads too much. If these are a problem in your area, throw in Decree or Resistance.

Vs. Mains of any sort- Track your destinies and don’t spread too much. Remember that you can always run to the DS DB if things get too hot. Wait for your own beatdown opportunities.

Vs. Just about anything else- Track your destinies, keep retrieving, and play smart.

Well, there you have it. Let me know what you think. Feedback is appreciated, but if you rate me poorly, at least let me know why. Thanks.
