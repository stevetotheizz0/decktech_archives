Strategy: 

This deck is to kick butt and after annialating them, you drain for tons!


Basically, get Jabba, glaid ,chall, and maybe 1 more alien at the audience chamber while stacking the ugnaughts in your hand. By 3rd turn you should lay down at least 3 ugnaughts and get boba and another support alien over to the chamber.


By 4th turn, you should freeze. Then put a good bounty hunter or 2 to escort boba fett and his captive to the audience cahmber. After getting captive to the chamber make shore you get galid to the chamber so you can drain for 2 at 4 sites(cantina,JP,Lower passages, and audience chamber.)
 Then put down a presence of the force to get drain of 9 going. put Dr e and ponda with dengar with blaster carbine of CC boba fett armed with his blaster

The only deck it has trouble with is Ebo in that case go in with 5 people and kill of protectors to cancel and for big drains. if they get good men to protect it it is crucial to freeze so you can hope to kill something important.


This deck if played right should be an easy win
