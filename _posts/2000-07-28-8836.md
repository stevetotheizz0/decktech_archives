Strategy: '

Well, this is just like any uprising deck out there, except for the fact it uses ASP-Droids and Ewok Catapults to line up 7&#8217;s for retrival. It still boasts the power of the normal M&T Deck, with most of the cards that the retrival engine needs is taken from effects and inturrupts and trading SAC for SAC protection. The rest is self explanitory. Well, that&#8217;s about all, I hope to get your reviews soon.'
