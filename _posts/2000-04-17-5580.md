Strategy: '

  The strategy behind this deck is to just simply overwhealm your opponent.  Here's how I attack different deck types.
   Hunt Down  Cancel visage by deploying a spy at the holotheatre with any back-up that may be needed.  Turn the tables by draining them at their own executer sites.	Keep Obi and Luke in hand until you draw at least one of the anti-dueling cards.  Just thwart them with all the ablility 4 aliens and other epps until that time comes.  You will be able to spread out much more than most Hunt Down decks.
   Raltiir Operations	This deck has so many characters, that you should be able to take control of Raltiir early.  (At least, thats what I've been able to do against it)  If Sandwhirl is prevelent in your area, take out a sence, and the grimtaash for 2 controls.
   Space decks  Pray, this is the decks weakness.  I was fortunate to be able to beat a pure tie deck in the championships, but here's the way to attack it.	Don't bother with the nudj's, deploy your Obi and Master Luke with their sabers to the swamp and farm to get a drain going.  Eat the drains in space until you can build your hand with Super Falcon.  Save your Sence/Alters for the pending All power to weapons and Lateral Damages.  Don't worry about any other effects, because thats the only one that can kill you.
   ***Note for Newbies.  The h'nmethes hurt early on when your opponent is only activating for 4 force.  They are not going to want to pay 4 for an At-At pilot when the "harmless" little alien is sitting on Raltiir with a main at his side.
