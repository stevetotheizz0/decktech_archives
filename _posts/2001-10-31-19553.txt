Strategy :


Ok, let’s check my strategy. Podracin’ mixed up with Court and Watto’s Box is just
ruf. First like in all Court decks, try to keep the chamber clean,
with some alien characters like Jabba, Boelo and Ephant Mon. Imperial Berrier and 
None Shall Pass will help you, then get out with your bountys and battle battle battle,
with scum in combo with first strike it will be just a lot of fun to kick some rebel asses, and to
retrieve 3 force per battle, after some turns and battles, you will be able to retrieve 
11 force with podracin’ of course against light side anakin it will be hard to win but selbulba
is better than anakin, and with Podracer Collision it will be easy, so try it, and tell me how it works.


Thx to all who rate my deck, and if you have some awesome new ideas, just tell me !!!!!!
