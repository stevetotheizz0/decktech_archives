Strategy: '

First off, you must win the podrace. At all costs, WIN THE DAMN PODRACE. If you lose the podrace, this deck will probably lose. As will ANY Light Side deck in the Type 2 Enviroment.


Secondly, once you win the podrace, gain control of the senate. Once you have gained control of the senate, and you have flipped, and you have won the podrace, you can gain a lockdown on your opponent.


Key cards to look out for 

Coruscant Maul

The Phantom Menace

Keder the Black


And there is nothing you can do about thse 3 cards. Just try and keep them in check, thats all you can do. Hopefully, your opponent will make the mistake to use Keder before the podrace is over, so when you win, you retreive your senator right back.


Hope the deck helps you out as much as it did for me.


{PS, please do not rate this deck badly because it is Type 2 and it will not survive outside of Type 2, its not made to survive outside of Type 2, so thus thats why its a Type 2 deck.}


Thank you. '
