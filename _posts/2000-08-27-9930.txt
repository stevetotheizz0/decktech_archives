Strategy: '

just do the basic thang of deploying only 1-2 sites and slap down major posse of hunterz and thier colleagues.  if they wont cum to yer planet deploy search and destroy using u cannot hide forever.  believe me....THEY WILL COME DOWN IF THEY'RE LOSING FORCE FROM TATOOINE OCCUPATION, MY OBJECTIVE, GALID, AND SEARCH AND DESTROY.'
