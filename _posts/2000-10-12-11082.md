Strategy: '

Use the starting stuff i marked. You may want to start a different effect against a YCEPBT/OBD.  Use Jerjerodd’s game text to get out the sectors and the superlaser each turn. Deploy starships and systems as you get them. get a Chiraneau out as fast as you can and try to control three systems, at least. I’m thinking of going with a normal executor, more SDs and TIEs and a couple more systems and ditching the ex. sites and FL. OPS. Basically beat them in space and drain them for as much as you can muster. Please offer any suggestions you have. I’m going to post an updated version after it’s been reviewed and I’ve played it some more. Thanks for looking at this. '
