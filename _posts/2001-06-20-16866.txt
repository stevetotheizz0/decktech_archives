Strategy: '

I cant believe Im playing Endor Ops. A year ago I was laughing at this objective, and now its the only one I trust. Its resistant to beatdown, youve got nothing to protect, youve got 3 grabbers, a strong space fleet with many interrupts to help out, walkers/tramples, undercover spies, and plenty of high forfeit characters. Problems? It gives out force, and it gives out quite a bit. Is that a huge problem? Not as huge as you think, because the benefits just simply outweigh it.

If youd like to read a more in-depth strategy section, please take a look at Endor Ops v 2.0 on my page.

Updates from previous Endor Ops

- Threw in Sebulbas Pod. With the high destiny 24(4,5,6s) in the deck, you never know. Plus, it stalls, and isnt that whats important?

- Why Mon Cal? It’s close to most major systems, it’s force drain -1 for my opponent, and with Ominous setup, it’s a drain of 3(4/5 with Chiraneau and/or POF). Kashyyyk is good, but I have to protect Kashyyyk, as it’s a drain of 2 against me. Early on, this might not be feasible, and bad luck can also have an effect. Switch it as to your liking.

- Dumped in 2 Scythe Ties + 2 Tallon Rolls. I figured this would virtually guarantee me victory in space. Why not? The Ties are destiny 4, the tallon rolls are recycable destiny 6s.

- Gravity Shadow. This card rocks and should have been in the last EOPS deck. Use it at the right time and you might take the game right there.

Thats about it. For those who are thinking about using this deck (with mods to your liking of course), take it slow, be cautious. You can generate usually between 14-20 force even against WYS, so reinforce your locations, and spread from there. Once Ominous/Decree are up and running, youll have a major advantage in a drain war.

Tell me what you think, and tell me what mods I should make, not what cards I should add. There are 30 cards Id LIKE to add ) but unfortunately, current SWCCG rules prohibit that. One last thing, many people ask why I dont play YMSYL. Its because I dont like the starting sites, I want to start with Opp/TINT as my 3rd effect, and YMSYL is considerably more predictable than EOPS. Have fun....
