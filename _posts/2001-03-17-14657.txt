Strategy: 

Change
---
Take out Mos Eisley, add Spaceport DB so I can pull a second Tat site from deck.

End change
---

Before you rate this deck low because it builds the Death Star take a look at it. This deck kills the opponent so quickly and easily that it’s not funny. Ever heard of 7 direct damage a turn?

How to play
---
First turn you get 5 force to play around with. Put down the DS2, IAO, and grab the DS2: DB. Put Jerjerrod there for 3. Use him to get the Coolant Shaft. Next turn you’re getting a whopping 9 force. Deploy the capacitors and the Tatooine: DB. Start deploying characters to Tatooine, and spread them out over the planet. Third turn you get 11 force. Deploy the Reactor Core and That Thing’s Operational. During all this you’ve been dumping your Tatooine sites, and possibly deployed either Tatooine or Merrejk to search for it. You should also have been Twi’leking for important effects. If Tatooine is out (which it should be normally) move the DS2 over there.

At this point you are direct-damaging for AT LEAST 3 a turn from TTO, usually more if you’ve got more Tat sites down. You have good enough ground power to control all 5 Tatooine sites, and the Barriers will help you if a mains beatdown comes along. Overseeing It Personally and 2 Presences help even more. Your six ships are more than enough to control space, but the major worry is them blowing up the Death Star. Put the Sword and the Shield there for protection, and let the bounty hunter ships drain at Endor and Tatooine until they’re needed. If you want, grab the Superlaser for protection against Home One/Tantive IV, etc.

End How To Play
---

To sum it up:
Seven force loss a turn from That Thing’s Operational if all 5 sites are out
Drains of up to 17 on ground
Drains of up to 3 in air

Now for the matchups...

Vs. WYS - This could be a problem deck, seeing that we’re fighting for the same turf. All I can say is play your game, not the opponents.

Vs. Hidden/Throne Room Mains - Beatdowns = bad. Bunch up your guys and save your Barriers.

Vs. EBO - Forget about space draining and just control the DS2. Even if EBO is draining at its best (like 12-15) you’ve still got an advantage with the direct damage + force drains.

Vs. HB Flip - Same thing as EBO, except that their drains are gonna be even lower, so you’ll win faster. Simple as that.

Vs. MWYHL - Fine, so no Overseeing it Personally. Otherwise, just play it like a Mains deck.

Vs. Anything else - Just play your game. You’ll win :)
