Everyone insisted I include the new helper card even though it’s not out yet, so don’t get on me for having one Tatooine card and not others.
Now back to our regular programming  )

Okay, this deck revolves around the "Big Three" effects of Dark Deal, CC Occupations,
and Search And Destroy.  These effects can cause massive force-loss for the opponent
(hence, No Escape).  You have a pretty simple strategy of holding CC on the ground and
in space.  Should they not come to the ground, No Escape will stop Honor, while S&D
wrecks them.   Should they come to space, you have a fairly large space fleet, say, at least
enough to hold 2 systems.  You can hold BCC with the Obsidian Squadron stuff to flip
and then sit on Bespin (and Tatooine against WYS) and wreck them.  The dueling cards
are tight because (a) your opponent will never see them coming, and (b) they are trackable
6s.  As I said, you will play a "Hold Bespin and CC sites w/variations against specific
decks (as specified in the matchups)."  You can cause awesome force-loss with +Drains,
S&D + CC Occupation.   

 You play several counters or counter strategies so you can battle any deck.  Here are the
matchups

WYS Flip and then go to the Tatooine System.  Sit on  the two systems (Executor at
Kessel, if necessary) and let them have their sites.  

Mains Go to space and Battle Order will stop them from draining.  ATE someone and
Duel.  Out-drain them.  Slow down any OMDH or On The Edge with Secret Plans. 
Guri+Xixor are a wrecking crew.  

HB or EBO X-wings S&D will kill them over time.  Hold only Bespin and you won’t get
over-powered in space.  Dark Deal+CC Occ.+S&D will murder them.

TIGIH Try to get rid of Luke with a Guri+Xixor at the DB should he come.  Sit on CC
against speeders.  against the mad flip you’ll have to kill Luke at all costs.

MWYHL Can you say S&D? ;)

Deadbolt Drain it and they will come.  (gotta love Sobe )


Here are the card reasons

DVDLOTS love the Choke.

Lord Vader against TIGIH should it come to that.

EPP Vader better for suicide runs.

Mara tight

Palpy leave him alone and he’ll be ’Pulpy’.

GMT great with Vader.

GA Thrawn sit him on the Chimeara.

Mighty Jabba quite nice for holding a site w/4-LOM or two.

4-LOM sweet

Xixor and Guri Great together

The Ships The BHs and SDs have the best immunity and the TIEs are nice w/Tallon Roll
at CC.

The ’Sticks necessary.

The various locations Plaza retrieves sites, Chamber is pulled, DB for getting places,
Walkway is a 2/1 location and can be pulled w/I’m Sorry.

Secret Plans anti-retrievel

Battle Order anti-drains

No Escape stuffs Honor

TINT/OE anti-SAC

YCHF pulls S&D, anti-numbers

BDC anti-Barrier

I’m Sorry Duh

Focused Attack add that Destiny

Wep Lev.  Pull a stick or steal a Stick.

Twi’lek Pull those effects.

Prep. Def. start the effects.

OAP anti-frozen and Grimtaash

Dueling stuff unseen menace.

C/SFS stop drains and Beats.

Oh, Switch Off Stop them from hitting Guri, Iggy, and 4-Lom, trackable 6.

DM/TR can be better than cannons.

Hope I covered everything, thanks for reading. '
