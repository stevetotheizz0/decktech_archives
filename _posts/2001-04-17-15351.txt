Strategy: 

Everyone insisted I include the new helper card even though it’s not out yet, so don’t get on me for having one Tatooine card and not others.
Now back to our regular programming  :)

Okay, this deck revolves around the "Big Three" effects of Dark Deal, CC Occupations,
and Search And Destroy.  These effects can cause massive force-loss for the opponent
(hence, No Escape).  You have a pretty simple strategy of holding CC on the ground and
in space.  Should they not come to the ground, No Escape will stop Honor, while S&D
wrecks them.   Should they come to space, you have a fairly large space fleet, say, at least
enough to hold 2 systems.  You can hold B:CC with the Obsidian Squadron stuff to flip
and then sit on Bespin (and Tatooine against WYS) and wreck them.  The dueling cards
are tight because (a) your opponent will never see them coming, and (b) they are trackable
6s.  As I said, you will play a "Hold Bespin and CC sites w/variations against specific
decks (as specified in the matchups)."  You can cause awesome force-loss with +Drains,
S&D + CC Occupation.   

 You play several counters or counter strategies so you can battle any deck.  Here are the
matchups:

WYS: Flip and then go to the Tatooine System.  Sit on  the two systems (Executor at
Kessel, if necessary) and let them have their sites.  

Mains: Go to space and Battle Order will stop them from draining.  ATE someone and
Duel.  Out-drain them.  Slow down any OMDH or On The Edge with Secret Plans. 
Guri+Xixor are a wrecking crew.  

HB or EBO X-wings: S&D will kill them over time.  Hold only Bespin and you won’t get
over-powered in space.  Dark Deal+CC Occ.+S&D will murder them.

TIGIH: Try to get rid of Luke with a Guri+Xixor at the DB should he come.  Sit on CC
against speeders.  against the mad flip you’ll have to kill Luke at all costs.

MWYHL: Can you say S&D? ;)

Deadbolt: Drain it and they will come.  (gotta love Sobe :)


Here are the card reasons:

DVDLOTS: love the Choke.

Lord Vader: against TIGIH should it come to that.

EPP Vader: better for suicide runs.

Mara: tight!

Palpy: leave him alone and he’ll be ’Pulpy’.

GMT: great with Vader.

GA Thrawn: sit him on the Chimeara.

Mighty Jabba: quite nice for holding a site w/4-LOM or two.

4-LOM: sweet!

Xixor and Guri: Great together!

The Ships: The BHs and SDs have the best immunity and the TIEs are nice w/Tallon Roll
at CC.

The ’Sticks: necessary.

The various locations: Plaza retrieves sites, Chamber is pulled, DB for getting places,
Walkway is a 2/1 location and can be pulled w/I’m Sorry.

Secret Plans: anti-retrievel

Battle Order: anti-drains

No Escape: stuffs Honor

TINT/OE: anti-SAC

YCHF: pulls S&D, anti-numbers

BDC: anti-Barrier

I’m Sorry: Duh!

Focused Attack: add that Destiny

Wep Lev.:  Pull a stick or steal a Stick.

Twi’lek: Pull those effects.

Prep. Def.: start the effects.

OAP: anti-frozen and Grimtaash

Dueling stuff: unseen menace.

C/SFS: stop drains and Beats.

Oh, Switch Off: Stop them from hitting Guri, Iggy, and 4-Lom, trackable 6.

DM/TR: can be better than cannons.

Hope I covered everything, thanks for reading.
