Strategy: '

This is my first attempt at a profit, and ive never even played aggainst a profit, so i have absolutly no idea what im doing P.  i need some constructive reviews to help this out cause i have a upcoming tournament.



Strategy 

your starting cards in this deck are

profit

han solo-a retrival of 10 rather then 5 because it might take some battling to free him.

tatooniejabbas palace

jabbas palaceAC

HFTMF

insurrection-get tatoonie sites out(ex. tat and <> d/b)

staging areas-get activation

*3rd effect*-aggainst any big drain deck use ultimatum, aggainst a scum if they still exist use the camp, aggainst a podracer or ties use aim high.  anything else i use aim high cause u get the power +5 bonus alot.



to start with, deploy a d/b, only deploy somone if u feel its safe, otherwise draw for characters and interrupts or save force to storm the AC.  gather your force outside and move in with numbers to scare them out of the AC and free han, or fight them and retieve your losses when u free him.  



now spread out the main characters that give them direct damage 1 to a site, and keep in mind that your fallen portals work at every site cept the AC, even jabbas palace.  they should keep u pretty safe since yur destinies rnt too bad.  remember to make them take the direct damage during your control phase for the obj.  



continue draining, dealing DD(direct damage), and retrieving force by tracking a 5 or so and playing off the edge at the cc d/b; its not huge retieval but it helps.  i am working on raising the desinty but i need help with card choices.  anywase, dealing that type of damage and beating the heck out of the ground, and stopping most other drains should end the game on a posativfe note to say the least ;).



so, i need some help with what i should add and take out and help with things like whether i should play 3 js,jk’s or master lukes, and how many qui-gons to play, and if i should play a few bousshes.  i think it needs help and i have no experience with profit so i need some input.  and for the love of god dont give me lame 1-3 word reviews that dont help, they do nothing, go get 3 tech points somewhere else.  



thanks for the help, and if u have any questions or comments please d-mail me,
