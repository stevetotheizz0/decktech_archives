Strategy: '

This is a fairly standard non-flip court deck.  Its pretty easy to play and loads of fun.  I’m trying to make this from a "fun" deck into a tourney worthy deck, so please give suggestions when you review.


*Note* I don’t have Power of the Hutt, otherwise it would probably go in


Some card choices


Projective Telepathy-Anti OTE, also lets you battle, retrieve w/ scum, and cancel the battle.  Also useful against MWYHL/AFA


CHYBC- Anti MYWHL


Blast Door Controls- No Barriers or Narrow Escapes


U-3PO- block a drain, I don’t understand why more people dont use him.


Arica and Mara- You never know which one you will need


2 4-Lom w/ guns- Useful against Ben or JK Luke, also can go on ZiMH to add a destiny


Fett (and Iggy) on Ground and Space?- I can use whichever one I need at the time, and only one of each, so I probably won’t have persona issues


Against decktypes


EBO Get decree active ASAP.  Just try to hold one system and use the extra ships for retreival attacks.  S&D and court should finish them off.


HB I know, I need Hutt Influence, but I don’t have any JPSD, so I just have to rely on my ships to probe, and S&D and court them to death.  Should be relatively easy


WYS Start Secret Plans, take the easy drain at cantina while setting up Skum.  Go after his ships with yours (try to I have No Choice Dash), and battle order should be easy, as his characters are weak.


Anything else play well, and you should have a shot at winning.
