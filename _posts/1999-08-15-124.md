Strategy: '

Your starting location is Obi-Wan's Hut. With
Careful Planning you pull out a related
battleground site. If they start with any Tatooine
 site that is in the deck, just convert it. This
can provide a nasty early game force choke. The
rest of the deck is primarily a Mains and Toys deck.
The SAC ratio of 555, is there to be able to counter
almost anything your opponent can throw at you.

After looking at the deck list you probably have
 the following questions...

Q Why in the world is Run Luke, Run in your deck?
A This Card saved my Hide through out the day. It
can cancel Vader's Obsession and Luke can run into
any fight for free at an Adjacent site.

Q Ok, You have Battle Plan in your deck but no space
locations. Are you on crack?
A I use it to start a battle for free. I don't
 care if I have to pay for a drain every now and
again. Chances are that Dark side already has Battle
 Order out. This is because I am indeed on crack.
