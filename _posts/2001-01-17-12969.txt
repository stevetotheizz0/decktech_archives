Strategy: '

This deck is made for the popular "docking bay"
wars that seems to have taken over my meta.It uses heavy mains and mega retrieval to create the mains that wont die engine.

matchups


vs hunt down
This deck(with all the recyclable 6s) has built in dueling protection, but you still have to be careful when deploying the jedi. Try to jump on them early before they get to set up(i.e. vader tarkin walker iggy)menace fades is huge and the disarmeds can be killer.

isb tatooine
menace fades and battle order and order to engage....’nuff said

bhbm
give them jedi luke and tell them to lose 1 every time to thier objective....dont lose battles ...play conservatively...god that objective sucks

invincible court
tough match...again menace fades and battle order to slow them down....the disarmeds are HUGE against 4lom and iggy...I would suggest deploying to the tatooine db and walking in(especially if no bargain is out)....bottom line though, you gotta take over the audience chamber..retrieval can save u

overall this deck can give all decks a run because of menace fades and the retrieval....
play it well, and the diffs can be huge......the late game OMDH can make your opponent want to
quit.......
Later,
