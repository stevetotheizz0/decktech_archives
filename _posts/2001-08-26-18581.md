Strategy: '

Lets see.. Obviously this is a capture the queen deck, although you don’t really need the desert landing site to do much damage.  First, throw down palpy to the junkyard, Don’t pull Watto unless you haven’t drawn him up by turn 4, pull I have you know and monnok for some fun, then drop a couple powerful characters at mos espa to flip.  Keep IG-88 with palpatine to keep those wonderful jedi from coming close, just force lightning and capture, woopie.  Use operational as planned to recycle stuff, masterful move for the 6 and to get Ghhk, I considered putting the phantom menace in here too but I pulled it at the last second. Use no escape to prevent them from honoring when you flip and to get maul strikes again or monnok.  Marketplace, Incinerator, and probe droids are amasing retreval, I have like 6 droids in this deck, the incinerator is  a drain of 0 and a waste of time for the other side, you just retreve probe droids which you forfet and put them out again, use the marketplace for other retreval.  Presence the junkyard cause nobody wants to go there.  Sorry if the strategy sucked, I’ve played like 5 games with this deck and only lost aganst a senator deck. '
