Strategy: '

Strategy Use strike planning to pull crix and solo from the deck. Use crix to grab chewie, use chewie to grab wuta, and use wuta to grab sites. Then, use crix to grab midge and the rest of your scouts for enhanced drains. Back up your scouts with the speeders, and get out yarna and maneuvering flaps. Drain and battle like a champ. If vader or mara pay a visit, simply put your scouts inside the speeders to protect them from getting swung at.  Use insertion plannings wisely and spread out your scouts for great drains.

Why such low destinies? 
This deck is based on pure power, not high destinies 

Why insertion planning x3? 
To subtract 3 from each opponents destinies and to help keep your speeders alive. 

Why not docking bays? 
Too little drain capacity in my opinion.

Matchups 
Court Use YISYW to grab Honor, and deploy it. Set up the same. YOu should have no problem against this deck. Most court uses POTH to use hutt influence, so blocking their drains seems pointless. The direct damage might hurt you a little bit, but with Honor, you shouldn’t worry about it. Watch out for dengar w/ gun. 

MKOS Same as court only don’t grab honor 

HD Same as usual. Hide your scouts in the speeders and also get cracken to the executor to block visage. A simple matchup, except you need to get out Honor again. 

Any Space This is the hardest matchup. Get out squadron assignments and close air support. Drain like mad on the ground and use your ships for a single beatdown. 

That’s it
