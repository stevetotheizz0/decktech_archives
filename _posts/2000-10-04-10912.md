Strategy: '

Overview
Always start with Strike Planning, Wise Advise, and YISYW. The other effects are optional on which to use if need
be Use Strike P. to get out Han and Crix- Crix to get Chewie (and other scouts), to get Wuta, to get sites, to flip the
Objective
On the first turn get Madine, Han, Chewie, and Wuta.(Madine and Han before activating or on opponents turn and
yours )
Also lose YISYW to get "I wonder who they found" for Han.
Now that the first turns are over CONTROL ENDOR Get out scouts with Crix And get out The Bunker. If
opponent is force draining you lose ability 1 or 2 scouts you can get them back if you flip, DO NOT lose too many
though
I know comes in handy when Han "accidentally" is left alone at a site Hi Leia, and what do you have with you? Mr.
Lightsaber Get over here "Chop, Chop"
These Starships are here for protection of Tala twins. Nobody needs to lose those Battle bonuses from Close Air
Support
Independence may be changed for Liberty (it goes to the used pile if lost in a battle).
Where I am at M&#8217;iiyoom Onith is big Don&#8217;t know why. Well use shocking Info. it get’s the Onith out Or if opponent
isn’t using MO use it as a recyclable 5
I know "IWWTF" is hard to play but you can’t ignore the bonuses. Evildoers Beware
Keep R2-D2 at the Landing Platform, Back Door, Or Bunker. Why?	R2 says if at a Scomp link when opponent
draws destiny of 1-3 Activate 1 force----------4-6 may draw the top card of reserve deck into hand. Can’t argue with
that.
