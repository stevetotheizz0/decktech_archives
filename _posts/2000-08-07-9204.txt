Strategy: '

Against deck types

ROPS get Luke or Ben to Ralltir first then begin to Jedi Train.  Prevent them from flipping as
long as possible and hit them with Order To Engage.

TIES I hope She's All Right and since it will be a non-interactive game, activate ally our force
and keep playing out of commission, and retrieve with firgin & yoxit.

Hunt Down Honor + Jedi Knight Luke.

Bring Him Before Me Honor, Keep Ben with Luke so when Vader comes down you can still barrier him and battle next turn.

Set Your Course Probably the tougest game cause you'll probably see lots of big guys.  Get jedi training done and set up the mains.  Order to Engage once again w/ barrier.
