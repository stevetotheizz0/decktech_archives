That Thing’s Operational 

Strategy: 

At the beginning of the game deploy Endor and take Death Star 2, Moff Jerjerrod and Desperate Counters into hand. Then you draw a 6 card hand.  First turn deploy DS2 with Desperate Counters.  Depending on how much force you get, you might want to deploy Jerjerrod.  If you get him out the first turn, then you can get the deck going much quicker.  Then you get out a sector each turn until you have all 3 sectors on the table. Then you deploy That Thing’s Operational on the reacter core.  Next, if Tatooine is on table, pay one to move DS2 there.  Meanwhile, you should be deploying the tatooine sites so you can at least occupy them.  Then the fun begins.  You force drain them each turn, and then they loose 2 force plus 1 for each tatooine site you occupy.  Also, you are retreving a force each time you deploy a tie once you get out sienar fleet systems.  Then you get tatooine occupation on table so the are loosing even more force.  Also, if they deploy to a couple sites, then you try to gravel storm them.  Also, janus greejatus helps you track destiny.  After this, you may do what you like on ground and in space; however, it is best to stay on Tatooine.
