Strategy: '

well simple enough      no stratagies really  just get JP out & deploy & avoid battle & drain......only problem in MWYHL then spread damnm fast & drain till you cant......then n/p just take him where he is...if space.play it smart & deploy only necessary & retrive with nar shadda......AVOID BATTLEING IN JP
have fun boyos

HA it’s not the city it’s the imperial square......i’ve been dealing with the new obj too much, TRYING to make it work	;] '
