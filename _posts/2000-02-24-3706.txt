Wise Advice 

Strategy: 

This is a revised version of a previous deck. I took out the Revos and some other cards, and added some more adders.

The main thing to do is simply activate force then battle the opponent to death. The effects and interrupts are pretty self explanatory.

vs. Hunt Down- Courage and Glancing are there to protect in duels.
vs. ISB- battle them to death.
vs. Space- get your ships out early, and battle.
vs. Court decks- battle them and wipe out the bounty hunters before they capture you.
