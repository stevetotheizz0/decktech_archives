This is my little brother’s deck... (he’s 13)


Card Choices

  Defensive Fire? Let’s say you have a defensive fire and a limited resources in your hand and your opponent has 3 cards in hand, defensive fire might take a crucial card in their hand and lets you play your limited resources. It is also a piss off card that manipulates their hand.

  Oh Switch Off? Two words used six. It also protects Guri, 4-lom, and Iggy from being stolen, shot, or fallen portaled. 

  Endor Occupation? Used 5 that deals with CC and Tatooine Celebration.


Strategy 

  Turn 1Before you activate pull Kuat w/ Mobi Points, then activate and pull Spaceport DB w/ Imperial Arrest Order. You can move Xixor if you have back up at the bay or if you keep force for a barrier. Then track a card by placing it in your used pile and look at your Force pile. Try to get broken Conc. ASAP.


This is a force choke beatdown. It combined 2 popular AOBS decks with my own. It is also very fun to play


For matchups look at some more popular Agents deck, like **Vengeance**by Josh Grace or Dark Surgeon.        '
