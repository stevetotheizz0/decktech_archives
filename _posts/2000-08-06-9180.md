Objective (1)
Endor Operations/Imperial Outpost '

Strategy: '

Basic start is the objective and Prepared Defenses pulling Mobilization Points and You Cannot Hide Forever plus one other effect.  Then use You Cannot Hide Forever to get Royal escort for the defense 5 bikers.  MP for +2 activation at the DB.

Use tactical support for quick deployment of your men.	The ships are to hold endor first...then if you feel good explore.  Drain at endor planet and sites.  Abuse the no cancel of drains and one battle destiny in each battle.  Pin LS characters with Full Scale Alert and apply a beatdown.

It's a fairly strong deck using the overlooked biker scouts.  With my limited enviroment it's worked well.  Losing only to the new LS objective once...beating it once also.

The deck is fun so give it a whirl.
