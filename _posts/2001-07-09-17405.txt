 ***********UPDATE**************
oct 12,2001 
just so u all know this deck is old-skool so don’t be like this deck is old. just rate it how it was and not how the current meta is. I made this deck like after R2 so no pissing about Tatooine characters. if enogh of u ask I will update with new stuff
**************END***************8
fizzle...crack...pop....
and now back to your local programming







This deck is everything I could ever ask for in a deck. I have yet to lose with it. The extra support it gives is awesome and it drops the beatdown on opponents.

Locations-The locations are purely for Generation and to satisfy my effects. Kuat and Wakeelmui give a 4 generation will help in the early game if you can get them both out. Kashyyyk gives a drain of two and Coruscant a drain of 1. The reason I use prefects office is because I use a good amnount of leaders.

Characters- the people in this deck are the best.
enough vaders and the maul for surprises on you’re opponent. Janus does a good job of supporting the Emperor and Janus’s text make him the King. Ozzel can help for the DSII DB Mob. points gerneration. Arnet can Pilot both Tempest Scout 1 and Blizzard Scout 1. Dr. E can screw the opponent over and the same for the pesky opponents game text, and that’s why I put in 4-Lom WGun.

Vehicles- All my AT-ST can react which is why there in so you just save force and react to a battle that close enough.

Starships- I have a well rounded cast of ships but the only problem is the executors deploy cost. But everyone else Does there job.

Interrupts- My interrupts work well with this deck especially since nobody will expect I have you Now When maul or the emperor is using it. GHhk just in case. The others are self explanatory just control you’re opponts hand size with monnok and Beat him Down With You are Beaten.

Effects- Overseeing it personally should be one of you’re choices for you flipped Objective game text the drains can get pretty high with this. Bad Feeling Have I to make the luke dop for 12 to Ralltiir. Secret plans For Retrieval, Decree and so on.

MATCHUPS-

RST- Flip you’re objective early and try to control the Bunker and play smart and you may be able to beat it .

TIGIH- Flip and Wipe out Luke and win you’re share of battles which should be easy.

EBO- There Drains should be tough so start with Decree and watch them suffer as you’re +4 battle destiny screws them over.

PROFIT- Start Secret plans instead of Hide Forever. And this should be an auto-win.

HB- This deck can stop you’re drains but try to find the base , Imp. Decree them and Battle order and Beat them up on the ground.

This deck should be awesone in the hands of a skilled player as yet it is undefeated in my local Tournament.

Any good suggestions will be posted so if you have any questions D-Mail me.
