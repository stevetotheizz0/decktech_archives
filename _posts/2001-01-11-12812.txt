Objective (1)

Hidden Base '

Strategy: '

As you can see this is a space centered deck. The first thing you do is take all your planets out of your reserve deck. Make sure you do not take a planet with the same parsec number as the one you used in the objective otherwise you will have to flip the objective and then you will not be able to deploy anymore planets.

One of the most effects in your hand would be the squadron assignments. This lets you take a matching pilot from a ship from your reserve deck or vice versa. There is not much strategy behind this deck. All you pretty much you have to do is take planets from your reserve deck and deploy the ship and its amtching pilot to them.

When this deck is played correctly It can win agains almost every deck. And the good side of this deck is if your playing an opponent who has a character centered dark side deck you can stop the force drains because most of the pilots have fighting capability.

Thanks for reading my deck. Be sure to rate this one and look at a few others that I have posted. '
