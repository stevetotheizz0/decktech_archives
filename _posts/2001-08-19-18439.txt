**Response to Reviews**

Not good enough to beat WYS 
Sorta. I mean, what deck is? Huntdown has the best chance, but WYS has beat HD just as much as HD has beat WYS. I think that to beat WYS it all comes down to skill. This deck gives you the tools to control ground, and if you play well enough, controlling the ground will give you the win over WYS.

Post-Coruscant Choices arent good enough (See below)
Okay, okay, I did change more than those 2 cards, I added P-59, We Must Accerlate our Plans, and Mauls ship. I still didnt include The Phantom Menace because with tracking and saber swings, I have never had a problem getting rid of Jedi, and I dont really need the 7 destiny, this deck does just fine without it. (Besides, it doesnt really help against WYS, and when was the last time you saw a Qui-Gonn or non-Epp Obi?) But hell, add it if you want, I just dont play with it.

**End Response

This is card-for-card what I played at Vancouver, before Coruscant was tourney legal. Ive been playing this deck all summer, and its current record is 11-1, losing to Charles Hickey due to me not getting a Maul until like turn 20. This deck is a machine that can (and has) beaten everything. But, since Coruscant has come out, some little changes need to be made. Here they are

REMOVE
Darth Maul x1
Teemtos Podracer

ADD
Darth Maul, Sith Apprentice
Theyre Still Coming through

And thats it. Maul Strikes is waaay to exclusive to be effective, and I have Weapon Lev. for sabers. The Phantom Menace just sucks in a deck that cant start with it, and putting destroyer droids, Nemoidians, or Senators is a very, very, VERY bad idea.

For more strategy on this thing, go read my lastest TR, The Vancouver Open, or go look at THE Maul Deck, posted on my page. For now, I will address some issues that came up during reviews of THE Maul Deck

Why No Emperor Palpatine
This deck wants to capitalize on Hit-and-Run tactics, not Sit-and-drain tactics. Guess which one the Emperor is good for?

Teemtos Pod is Stupid
No, its not, it has proved very useful, but with C. out, I wont be needing it anymore.

Hidden Base flip will kill you
True, very true....until I added Hutt Influence, now HB flip stands NO chance. (For more on this, go read my Vancouver TR)

Im not going to go into deck match-ups, I mean crap, this is just a solid mains deck. Play it right and you beat everything, play it wrong and you lose to everything. Plain and simple, no secret tech needs to be explained. Once again this deck is 11-1 (not counting pick-up games, then its like 25-3), and it went 3-0 in Vancouver. Its good.
