Strategy: '

   The strategy of this deck is relatively straight forward.  Signal in Insuurection against most decks( Battle Plan for Ops or ISB)and try to get a CC site or 2, if you started with Insuurection you can pull the Docking Bay whenever you want to.  Deploy your fleet to Bespin as neccessary to protect the system and when you're ready deploy CC Celebration.	Most of the Characters are fairly versitile so they can be deployed either in space or inside CC, so they lend themselves to whatever the situation.

   One of the most powerful cards in the game right now is Path of Least Resistance...so use it to its fullest.   Not only is it great for jumping into combat,  its even better at jumping out.   If you're confident on not facing SAC you can spread out 1 character per site and drain away without fear because you can warp away elsewhere before combar begins.  I like to try to get my ability 4 + characters to various sites before deploying the celebration, that way even if i don't get the path off,at least I get a draw to offset the beatdown, although careful play should never let this happen.   Aswell Path also provides duel protection for Luke...if there are 3+ sites down and Luke is at an end one, Vader can't Ellis in because you've started Insurrection vs. Hunt Down,	and if he gets picked up and re-deployed you can warp away 2+ sites before he can Obsession.  If Vader Starts walking over keep Luke away by moving away, then warp back again, or if Vader picks up to deploy again, do the same thing again.	 Path is also wicked against spies, both in leaving them behind or warping in to Sorry about the mess them.  So it really is important to utilize your mobility advantage with path effectively.

  The other neat thing about CC right now is the ability to hide your characters away from the 'big blue' threat out there right now.  No exterior sites = no AT-ATs or AT-STs to worry about.

   So there ya have it, an overall balanced deck with good potential to take on alot that gets thrown at it.  PLease remember when reviewing that against most dark side decksthere is a counter somewhere inside so please take the time to look for it...Have Fun. '
