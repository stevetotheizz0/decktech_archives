Strategy: 

Update: This deck really sucks, so don’t use it. Look at my page for other updates.

Deploy speeder bikes and pilots for heavy defense. Grab Establish Secret Base first, then Ominous Rumors so that you don’t spread out too far. Combat Response will pull you many good ships and their pilots. Drain away in space and on the ground. You should get massive accumulations with ESB and OR. Enough power so that any attempt to attack your forces in space would be a horrible descion, possibly game winning for you. The ground needs some good interrupts. Anybody suggest any? Other than that pretty self explanatory.
