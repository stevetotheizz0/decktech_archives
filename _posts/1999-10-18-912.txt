Strategy: 

First off, I am aware there are only 4 locations in the deck.  That's the tech right there.  I pull the death star docking bay, and the executor docking bay.  Okay, so now I got my battleground to flip, and I can get back to the executor for free.  Okay, here's where the tech begins.

Battle Order and Come Here You Big Coward totally swing this game in my favor.

If my opponent is playing Hidden base, I generally twilek or play Battle Order ASAP.  Okay, with out any force from me, save but one, this seriously puts a damper in my opponent early drains.  And with the one battle ground site being the D* docking bay, I can pound them there with Walkers, and Put All Sections On Alert (also good during dueling).  My space compliment is enough that, with Vader at the Chamber, with the objective flipped, My ships act as a wrecking ball, especially the Bus.	throw up an imp with it, and if the manage to draw a 3, I lose the imp.  Plus, I'm pounding them with a couple destiny (averages a 10 late game, after stacking)

Against Toshe Tech, I usually have to abandon the chamber text, and go guns-a-blazing to the ground.  Walkers, Pilots, Vader, Tarkin, and the big 3 (Barich, Irol, Drelosyn) can totally kick it up.  I did lose to a harvest deck at the open.  I had a couple of very bad destiny draws, and did make a stupid mistake.  But the game could have swayed differently.	If I win a duel or two, That would be game.

against Ops.  Once again, Vader, subtracting 2, and Walkers and Speeder bike Steamrolling over Bothuwi.

This deck is very Solid, utilizes the denial aspect, one small pesky drain, and visage, plus steamrolling my opponent to death at there location.

And don't go 'You'll totally get spanked by sanc.  Remeber, a strong deck that is week to one deck has star rating of 4 1/2 *.
