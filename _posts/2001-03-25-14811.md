Strategy: '

I start out by training and try to finish as fast as possible (like usual). I stop force drains with Undercovers and It Could Be Worse and try not to battle on ground until later on when I’m finished with training. I keep my space support up and hold off what I can. I use the ASP and Ewok Catapult to get my 7 when ever I need it at Endor Docking Bay. Most ground beatdown decks are stuck and left with nothing to do. Read this, I substitute jedi test number 6 for 1 it could be worse. '
