Strategy: '

PLEASE READ
Dont rate until you see what this is. Use any signals drawn to pull the important effects to hold in hand until use (EBO, LTA, SA, & Squad assignments are the most important.) if you lose any effects early on, go for honor of the jedi and use an effective repairs to pull back the effects.
First turn pull two sites (before activate ALWAYS) and play them. Save any characters to drop all in one turn. Save the admirals orders until you need it.
2nd turn pull two more sites save force or draw to your liking
3rd turn pull ebo(if needed) and mon calamari system.Drop and play EBO if possible.same with the capital support.
4th start the setup. pull two more systems. Start dropping at mon calamri and moving out. use staging areas to become more versatile in deployment.
5th pull last systems. drop and drain. Battles should be no big deal this deck has plenty of power. Slow start but a power finish.

Playing vs the new objective, pull the endor system early (As soon as vader drops) and put luke there on a ship to satisfy your destiny.
and use our only hope if you need to get cards back from insignificant rebellion.

This deck is not 100% please leave ideas with ratings. EBO and LTA are to give you drains of four and five at the systems. Have fun...'
