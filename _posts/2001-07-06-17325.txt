Strategy: 

Early game:

Grab something with Death Star in its title (the War Room or a Gunner), and Commence Primary Ignition. You may want to risk an early Command, especially if your opponent doesn&#8217;t have Wise Advice on the table. Set up activation, get your Superlaser and Gunners (to the War Room), and prepare to blast away Alderaan. 

Mid game: This begins once Alderaan has been blown away. Use Ultimate Power to get all of your systems out of your deck, and start setting up the Big Blue fleet. At your systems drain with Chiraneau and the flip side to utterly destroy your opponent. Don&#8217;t over-deploy. You want to save extra star destroyers to retrieve force and beat down your opponent. If your opponent does get careless, then lay the smackdown on him.

End game: There shouldn&#8217;t be much of an end game if you set up the big drains. If you play against Jedi Testing or a very heavy light side space deck, you may need to consolidate your forces and just drain for 4 or 5 at 2 or 3 of your systems and retrieve when you can. 


Okay, I don’t beleive too much in matchups, cuz it really depends on each individual player, and each individual deck. Sorry for a short strat, but really, thats all this deck needs. I copy and pasted from Word, so if theres tags, it ain’t my faul. Enjoy the deck, I sure do.
