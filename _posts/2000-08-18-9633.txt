Strategy: 

Ok, the idea of this deck was take from dawi's deck, so props to him. but i completely revised it. just about the only things that stayed were the senses, alters and m'iiyooms, so dont hose it! now onto the strat

Basically, get out mob points to get some good activation when you draw the DBs. try and get merrejk and chiraneau and use merrejk to draw the systems, and chiraneau to drain like mad. that is why i have so many SDs, so i can be sure to draw them.

SCANNING CREW IS NOT DEAD. "insight will kill you! blah blah blah" well, everytime i played, people ditch insight for honor of the jedi, and if they ditch it, screws are very much alive.

use m'iiyoom to kill there mains and unique characters. use the screws to keep the female rebs out of their hand. use AAA to make them lose force since they wont be able to deploy with no one in their hand because of m'iilyoom and screws (stick m'iiyoom on the DS, since you dont take any battle damage on there, and with 4 of her in the deck, what does it matter if you lose her?!)

keep control of the systems and just drain. it works fine.

just sense and alter everything. the vaders and mara should allow you to draw one early on, so get them down asap.

use boring convo and point man to cancel those cards that hurt so much.

please dont give me a half star and tell me this deck sucks. give it a decent rating, and some input on what it needs (what cards to pull, what to throw in, etc etc) saying it sucks doesnt help me, you or anyone. so just help my out, and give me some pointers. thank you
