NOTE Please look at the whole deck plan, card explanations, and playing strategies before rating it.  It took me a lot of time to write it. Thanks  -)

Response to &#8220;darck jedi&#8221;

No I don&#8217;t need a Lobot because they can&#8217;t replace my Lando, the reason is that I have Ephant Mon at the same site and he prevents gamblers from deploying to the same site and when you replace a character you have to obey deployment restrictions.  Although I did add another Frustration and a Monnok/Evader.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Actually this is my second copy of this deck, with a few modifications.  I had posted this deck a month ago, but someone pointed out that if they gave me General Calrissian then my deck was wreaked because I couldn&#8217;t use Lando who corner piece to this deck.  But with the release of Reflections 2 I can now use Jabba&#8217;s Prize in place of one of their captives and now I don&#8217;t have to worry about my Lando getting stopped.  Besides between the Jabba&#8217;s Prize and my Lando it really hurts superfalcon and mains decks.  So sit back and see the power of a sabacc deck&#8230;

For those of you who don&#8217;t know the power of the CC sabacc engine I will explain.  Once you get Lando, Expand, and the Casino setup up every time you win sabacc you retrieve 3 and you get to make them lose one card from their sabacc hand.  You don&#8217;t even really need to retrieve for sabacc to be good, just toast all of their mains and good cards.  Sabacc can also be used to use up all of an opponent&#8217;s destines so they can&#8217;t draw or shoot weapons.  Or you mess up their stacked destinies.  So don&#8217;t under estimate the power of sabacc

Here is a general overview on how you play with this deck.  You always start Power Of The Hut and for those of you who don&#8217;t know what it does, it allows you to deploy Ephant Mon from your reserve deck.  The other 2 cards depend on what your opponent starts.  Most of the time you want to also start Imperial Arrest Order to prevent a Nabrun beat down.  Ok, before you activate any force on your first turn pull Lando with the prison text (unless you got him in your hand).  If they gave you at least 2 force then deploy Lando and Ephant Mon to the prison.	If not then just deploy Ephant Mon.  Also make sure to deploy AC. Then draw until you get Casino and Expand deploy it and expand the empire on it so that your Casino text is expanded to the prison.  You can sit there all day and play sabacc and not have to worry about poor Lando getting hurt and you retrieve 3 each time you win.  After your sabacc is setup just play your mains however you see fit either for beat down or for protection.

Here is a few explanations to some of your questions.

What if they Choke my Ephant Mon?

Never fear Hut Smooch is here.	Use it to bounce their spy.  You also have barriers to stop their beat down and if you are really afraid of an attack, just put a few characters at the Prison.

What if they Alter my Expand The Empire?

Don&#8217;t worry just try to get your other one or retrieve the one you lost with Prescott.  Or if you can&#8217;t get it back just move Lando with some protection to the Casino.  Preferably Darth and GMT.

What happens if Lando gets killed?

You have 2 and you can retrieve him and get him back with a little bit of tracking.

Can&#8217;t they just replace your Lando?

No they can&#8217;t, the reason is that you have Ephant Mon at the same site and he prevents gamblers from deploying to the same site and when you replace a character you have to obey deployment restrictions.

Isn&#8217;t your deck wrecked if they grab your CC Sabacc?

Hardly, it might make it harder, but it isn&#8217;t the end of the world if your sabaccs get grabbed.  Even if your sabaccs get grabbed you still retrieve 18 force with them and they lose 6.  Also you still have your Trooper Sabaccs to play with.  Furthermore, you can play Frustration to make them lose their grabber.  Just wait until they either pull it with the signal or when they start saving 3 force.

Why the Reactor Terminal?

Because I like it. -b	Actually, it is helpful because you do need to do some drawing to get the deck going.

Why only 3 starships?

I feal that once you get your retrieval engine going then you can just sit back and retrieve, but if you want add another ship in place of the Sniper.

I think that most of the cards are self-explanatory.  You should have enough mains to stop anything that the LS might throw at you.  If Sense and Alter are big in your area then you could take out the Sniper to add Oppressive Enforcement, although when the new Do Or Do Not/Oppressive comes out then stick that in.  Also if HB is dead in your area then you could take out the SP and add a DS2 Docking Bay for some more force.

Now For the Matchups.

Vs. Hidden Base-

Shouldn&#8217;t be too hard, just start SP and get out and start stealing their starships with sabacc.  You should be able to control the ground.  Watch out for grabbers&#8230; not to hard of a game.

Vs. Hidden Mains, or HBX-

Start Crush The Rebellion.  Watch out for Sense and Alter.  This is a harder match up.	Just toast their mains and retrieving cards and you should be able to overpower them cause you can keep retrieving the characters you lose.

Vs. MWYHL-

Ha ha, can you say DECK WRECK	You should be able to win easy all you have to do is toast Yoda, DOS, Training Area, and any Jedi Test and they are done for.  You toast them with your sabaccs for those who didn&#8217;t fallow.	Enough said, Next&#8230;

Vs. EBO-

You can start Imperial Arrest Order if you want.  Try to toast their EBO stuff.  That would really hurt.  Also steal their starships.  You should be able to drain some on the ground.	You also have Lando and Han on table so it will stop Lando In Falcon and Superfalcon.  Just keep your retrieval going.	It will be a harder game, but you should be able to win.

Vs. Profit-

Start Crush The Rebellion.  Your Jabba&#8217;s Prize will start at AC and it will flip your obj.  Use your mains to take out Han.  I have played and beaten a Profit deck already.	They can&#8217;t handle all of your guys + if you lose them just retrieve um and come back for more.

Vs. Rebel Strike Team-

You should win easy.  You have Lando already so their Falcon is kinda worthless.  They really won&#8217;t challenge you at the prison too much so just go after them on the ground.  Toast their mains with sabacc and you should do fine.	Moving on&#8230;

Vs. There is Good In Him-

Don&#8217;t go after Luke with Vader.  Just hit him with like 4-Lom and IG-88.  You really don&#8217;t even need to bother him.  You can retrieve all that he drains you for.  Eloms might be a problem, try to get rid of them with the Doctor and Dengar. You should win.

Vs.  Agents in the Court

Your mains should be able to take anything they have.  Watch out for sandwhirls and choke.  They won&#8217;t be able to handle your direct damage and retrieval.

Vs. Any other Mains deck-

Star Crush and There is No Try.  The key is to smoke their mains and retrieve.	You should win cause you can go the distance and they can&#8217;t.	-)
