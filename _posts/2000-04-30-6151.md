Strategy: '

Yet another of my many Bounty Hunting Decks.

Capturing
*All Wrapped Up
*Hidden Weapons
*Bossk
*Iggy
*Oo-ta Goo-ta

Draining
*Gailid
*Mara's Saber
*3 drain 2 sites

Strategy
Obviously I want to flip and feed.  Against almost all decks I start with either Mara or Gailid, depending on my starting hand.  Both  help my drains, but Mara lasts a little bit longer ;)
If they won't come to you, then they will be hurting.	One because of the draining, and two because of battles with easy capturing.
Feeding to the Sarlacc is fun, I prefer it over the Rancor because I don't have enough trap doors and also because Rancor can be slashed by a saber.  You can also retrieve with the Sarlacc.
Skiffs help with feeding.  Plus, they can react and Pote is awesome on them.
Chall and Lyn Make deployment easier, and the chamber helps too.
In general, Expand TE goes on either the farm or the AC

AGAINST MWYHL
Stay and drain.  Even with test 1, the drains can still hurt big.
If possible, get out Tatooine and fly to Dagobah with a couple hunters.
Another fun thing to do if they have Han, Chewie, or Leia to fight with during testing is we're the bait.  When the character is captured, opponent loses 2 force each turn and Luke can't test.  It's only canceled if Luke comes to you.
This deck really hasn't had a problem with this type of deck, so I don't worry a lot.

AGAINST TOCHE START/MAINS
Hidden Weapons sure is a funny card)
Mara can slash down intruders to the court
Boba or Jodo can get to T station to cancel the game text and fly out fast
4 LOM can cancel the game text of annoying characters
Myo and Niado have nice power and can go for attrition
Ree-Yees can boost up detinies
Dannik is fun when he eats the soup of mains
Skiffs can react around and add power and forfeit
None Shall Pass is kinda fun too
Sacrifice in cas they have those nasty EPPs
No Bargain can boost up the deploy cost

AGAINST UNDERCOVER SPIES
Nevar Yalnal, Hutt Smooch, and Sniper all work pretty well

AGAINST HIDDEN BASE/SPACE
Drain big and fast
Probe a little with the starships

AGAINST THRONE ROOM
Oo-ta for stopping Nabraun
Bubo for the Nudjis
Same techniques for getting rid of mains as mentioned under TOCHE START....

AGAINST ODDS/INSERTS
Resistance.  Enough said.  There are two extra twi'leks to help get out effects like this.



I will add Mosep as soon as I gind a copy of him)
