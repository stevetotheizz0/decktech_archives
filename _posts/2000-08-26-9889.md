Strategy: '

This deck is based around space battles.  The Star Destroyers provide powerful attacks.  Boba Fett, Ponda Baba and Dr. Evazian can be powerful on ground too, helping if an opponent is playing a ground deck.  Kessel makes all ships deploy -1, and getting Admiral Piett out early can help in that regard too.	The Victories should help if you have to go into ground battles.  With the large amount of starships, space draining is a secondary plan, but slower than battling.'
