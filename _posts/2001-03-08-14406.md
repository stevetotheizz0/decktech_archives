Strategy: '

Well whatever you are playin agaist u drop charcters for fast activation pulling a DB every turn.If you don’t have Vader in hand start searchin for him.Make a nice force on the ground and start force drainin and make em’ lose force to search and destroy once u get that goin...when u get luke and maybe win a battle or 2 bring luke to the thrown room(if they aint there already)Duel with the high destinies drain of 3 with his saber...janus...and presence at the thrown room...that tends to hurt after awile.this deck is meant to duel and battle not so much to cross luke but to cause damage.Thanx for your time and Peace out
