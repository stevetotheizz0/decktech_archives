*******Props to Scott LingrelL (sorry Scott) for iventing this archetype and for providing hints to good cards to play with based on TREPORTS*******


Strat If you can, insert and drop droids first turn in the throne room. Get nudj's and 2/0 sites for mains attacks.

COTVG This might be a tough matchup. Try to get odds moving quickly. Fight them with mains and use destiny adders, tibrin, and bacta tank to your advantage. Do as much battle damage as possible.

ISB Get odds goin and kill there weenines. All your ships should help too.

Space Once again, get odds goin. Use your ships to fight them where you can. Use Wedge and Toryn as pilots, and throw Luke/Han up there to help but don't let them stay for long. Hopefully you can last long enough and do some odds damage.

HDADTJ Cancel Visage, get odds goin, kill vader with EPPS. Continuous odds damge should do them in.

ROPS Get odds goin, kill vesden, take over space, and fight on ralltirr.

Also the grimtassh and push on us? are to try and take out torture from the game. The mains should be able to kill a decent amount of things, and can recur with the tank and tibrin. I don't normally play with Traffic Control but I decided to include it becuase I seem to draw more than I usually do to always have what I want. I am thinking about uping the Odds count to 5.

I think that is about it. I will add in coments when the reviews come in.
