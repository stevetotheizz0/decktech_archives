Strategy: '

Alright, this deck doesnt need much strategy to win, but here goes

This orignally started out as a Threepio Mess deck.  After a few playtests, i discovered that I never used the Messes, and decided to change them to It Could Be Worses. Its much better this way.


This deck has run through Garrison, Bring Him, RalOps, Court, ISB Big Blue, Dark Deal, HuntDown, and ISB troopers, with no sign of stopping.  Start Squassins in most games, but Menace Fades aginst Dark Deal. The main point is to win the race (impossible not to do, check the destinies), while setting up  forces both on ground and in space, and using 3PO to find ICBW to take NO damage from anything.  I’ve faced decks where you can just throw down Nett on ship in front of a couple Star Destroyers to block a drain.  They battle, Nett is immune to <5, and I just ICBW the 15 or so battle damage.  If you notice your opponent has a large Force Pile saved up and is keeping a card in theirhand ready, just dont do something like that. Simple.


Things People Think Might Be Problematic But Aren’t


activation

Almost every DS deck gives up at least a few icons, but even if they dont, you activate plenty.  I’ve played a couple Force choke decks and never come close to losing.  Plus, dont forget about I Did It giving you an extra force every turn.  You get more than enough, trust me.


It’s Worse

If you notice your opponent has a large Force Pile saved up and is keeping a card in their hand ready, just dont play ICBW.  I Did It will get any damage back soon enough.


Big Blue

Never come close to losing to ISB Big Blue. Sure they have enormous power in space battles.  But, for example, look at Wedge’s forfeit. 6. Add 2 with Insurrection.  Add 2 w/ Obj.  Add 2 w/ Karrde.  Plus, if you have lots of force saved up, and an ICBW in hand, well....
