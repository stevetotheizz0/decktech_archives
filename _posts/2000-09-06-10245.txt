Strategy: 

This is my first attempt at a Hunt Down deck, so be generous.	HotJedi should not be a problem with 2 battleground locations to pull in 2 turns, then only 1 to draw.	The Iggy/ 4-lom/ Zuckuss combo is killer.  3 destinies and no elom power bonus.  Speaking of eloms,  This deck combats them well, only giving them 4 different characters that makes them power 4.  Flipping should not be a problem with all the Vaders.  Dueling is easy, too.  2 Senses and 2 Focused Attacks, as well of GMT, should insure a win.	Now for the general strategies:

TIGIH:	Capture Luke ASAP.  He will actually help you in the fact that your opponent doesnt have him.  Once you get him to vader, move vader to the executor db where nobody can move to him.	Be careful where you battle, and use Onith to see whats in their hand.	Shouldnt be too hard.

Profit:  Start Mara and Zuckuss, then reinforce with Vader and Tarkin ASAP.  Try to pull a Sniper in case if they dont try to battle and free Han with Leia instead.  With Luke and Obi so easy to kill, it should be an easy win.

Hidden Base: This will be a tough matchup, seeing as I only have 5 starships in my deck.  Try to drain on the ground ASAP, make them lose to Visage, and probe with the few ships you have.

EBO:  Dont try to out-space them.  Start Decree and invade Hoth.  You should have enough ground power to push them out.  Drain at their former locations, but dont get too cocky.

RTP:  Thisll be tricky, but doable.  Use 4-lom at Leias location to cancel her game text, then hit her w/  a lightsaber.  Obj. out of play.  Game.

TRM:  Make them lose to visage until they put out a Jedi.  Duel, rinse, repeat.  Beat down on any other characters they get out.

RST:  Invade Endor.  If they try to blow up the bunker, keep it well guarded.  Kill Madine ASAP.  Alter Close Air Support if they use it.  Shouldnt be much of a problem.

MWYHL:	Go over and kick the apprentices butt.

Thats about it.  I know what I want to put in, just not what to take out.  LMK both, please.  Happy Reviewing!
