Strategy: '

There's loads of blue in this deck. You don't get much drain off Ralltiir it's a maximum of 3 without POTF or modifiers. You have plenty of twix inside use them for huge force activation. In the first few turns, flip the objective with walkers. The AT-ST pilots are inside although there's only 1 Tempest Scout. That's because they can be brought out with the objective to serve as drivers for the AT-ATs. Your 2/2 imps shouldn't be put on the ground without blue backing them up. Stuff them into walkers once you get the chance to. Don't put Igar into Tempest 1 - it's a waste of an ability 2 walker. Instead, put him into the Dune or a non-unique Blizzard. Run over anything that they put out. There's enough blue to go around. In case they're playing heavy space, there's the bounty hunter ships and the Executor to provide support. Endor is a very good planet for drains as it's close to Dagobah and Tatooine. Don't just sit back and drain, though. Go battle them. There isn't much drain potential in the deck - battling them is much better. Default start is Bad Feeling Have I - it seriously slows down the opponent.

Against MWYHL - Start Bad Feeling Have I. It'll slow them down. Once you flip, get out CHYBC and Secret Plans. They'll have to get someone off Dagobah in order to retrive 10 force. When that happens, run over them. If they're playing Surprise Assaulting Sevens, make sure that you don't drain without walkers present.

Against HB - With a HB start, you never know what's coming out. There's so many decks that use HB as a fake-out that it's not wise to start SecPrec. Start BFHI first. If they come down with EPPs them kill them. If not, flip and grab the SecPrec. Start probing.

Against Operatives - This type of game should be relatively easy. Start Battle Order. That'll slow them down. Then flip the objective. If their drains are still hurting you, set up Imperial Decree. Their drains = 0. Play POTFs and drain them out.

Against people meddling on your planet - Specifically, Ralltiir Operatives. Play 2/0 sites. Battle them off. Don't put out your sites, they'll get converted. It's not that difficult to get them off when you've got the blue.

Against Profit - Start IAO. Setup on your own planet. If he Nabruns over, get them stomped. When they free Han there's loads of things you can do to him. EPP Vader as suicide works fine for getting rid of him. If they're drawing madly to get cards, Monnok lost.

Against Choke - Start BFHI, flip, grab ImpDec. No more choke. If Revo/Nudj is popular in your area add CrushEvader.

Against Numbers - There's always Vesden. Get him, stash him in a walker. If possible, hunt down the infurating numbers and kill them all. No more troubles with Numbers.

That's about all. LMK if there's anything that you think could be improved. And do remember, there's no such thing as a perfect deck. '
