=================================
UPDATE
=================================

- Sense isn’t a problem.	I grab it and play Alter.  Sim makes sure you fail the draw.
- Honor isn’t a problem.	I activate about 10-14 force second turn usually, plenty to spread to 3 BGs 3rd or fourth turn.
- If you are going to give this deck less than a 5, tell me why.  Don’t say ”good deck” and give it a 4.  Why isn’t this deck worlds caliber?
- No Emperor because I do not own one.	If I had one, he’d be in here.
- Yes this deck can beat a good HB deck.

=================================
END UPDATE
=================================

vs. EBO  Start Resistance.  Imperial Decree does jack in this deck.  Resistance is better.  You get out Search and Destroy and you sit there at your docking bays and Rendili and smack em for 6 a turn, while taking only 2.	If they come for you, you beat the hell out of them.  Use your high destiny and so forth to make sure you smash them in any battle or duel.  Some people say that EBO beats Hunt Down, but I have beat 3-4 of them already, I’d assume not.

vs. Hidden Base  Start Battle Plan.  Get Executor Dbay first turn instead of a battleground one.  Flip, pop out Search and Destroy and watch their life force dwindle away.  If they come down with Obi or Luke, duel em.

vs. Throne Room  This is a dying deck, but start Crush.  This makes it so that you almost can not be beatdown.  No Clash and no more than 2 battle destiny.  if Obi or Luke shows up use Janus and Sim to rig some destinies and duel them away.  The last time I played against a Throne Room with this deck I won by 32 cards.

vs. Profit  This is a dying deck too, but this is kind of a hard matchup.  I’d start Crush the Rebellion with Mara and Evazan in the chamber.  Mara won’t get Clashed and then you can smack and operate on anybody.  Try and duel Obi and just smack Luke around.  Usually if you win one duel you will win the game.

vs. Anything else  use your brain and adapt to their game.  If they are non interactive set up Search and Destroy.  If they are then duel them and beat em up.

Some card choices 

Executor DBay - just in case I need to get to the Executor to stop a drain or setup Visage if they have a character there.

Sim Aloo and Janus - these guys are awesome in dueling.  I set up your destiny and make sure I get 2 6s.

CC and DS DBays are mobile sites, so no Projection of a Skywalker or Lost in the Wilderness.  I stole this idea from Brian Hunter.  I stole it fair and square, too.


Thats all I can think of for now.    '
