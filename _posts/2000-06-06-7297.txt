This deck uses Big Ones to get the Lambda Shuttles to transport your Miners, Mosep, and M*iiyoom Onith down to drain on the ground. The Lambdas go back up to the Clouds to drain with the Obsidians with bonuses galore from the Miners.

Some specific cards:
Big One - Let*s me get to Dagobah

Control - Protects my effects and interrupts, and cancels drains.

Dark Manevuers - Nice recycling 6; great with Tallon Roll

Lambda Shuttles - Land for free; destiny 4

M*iiyoom Onith - Slows down the opponent somewhat

Tallon Roll - Helps out some in the Clouds with the Obsidians

Your Eyes Can Decieve You - Great card in this deck; even better when Mosep is down at the middle Dagobah site. If you forgot this text, it turns the opponent*s Lost Pile face down and when he loses cards from Reserve (Mosep) he cannot view them.

This deck can be slow to set up, but by abusing Imperial Occupation every turn to check where all your needed cards are, it can become much quicker.

Battle Order and Ultimatum give this deck trouble. Battle Order is only a slight problem, since you won*t have much to spend your force on once you*re done setting up, you can just pay for your drains. Ultimatum, on the other hand, hurts badly, but most LSs around my area use Don*t Forget The Droids instead of Ultimatum for #s protection.

I*d like any constructive critisism you have for this deck. Thanks!
