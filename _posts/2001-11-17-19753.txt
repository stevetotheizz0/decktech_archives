Strategy: '

Basically this is a pile, but A GOOD PILE. Hehehe.

Okay. Start the jank I listed. Brisky Mornin, is a game saver. 

Defensive Shields you play
Don’t Do That Again
A Tragedy Has Occured
Only Jedi Carry That Weapon

Even though, the OJCTW doesn’t do anything, its better then the Planaetery Defenses.

Use Don’t Do that to go grab A Vergence. That is a VERY KEY Card against the DS Combat deck.

Another key card against the DS Combat is Strike Blocked. If I had more, I’d think about it.

Before entering the tournament, I was pondering if playing with a Padme or a Changing the Odds, I decided to go with the Padme.

Ki-Adi-Mundi is the perfect Jedi to just hold as a ONCE over in EP1 only. Drop him to the Tat Arena, and its held. They battle, they lose the top 1. You’ll probably take out one character with your destiny, then he dies. Then, drop another. No big deal. =-)

Jar Jar, I hate to say it, is basically the theme of the deck. Use him on hit-and run missions against Destroyer Droids [named or not], take em out and leave. Then, he goes to the "Tank". Once there, Gimme a Lift sends him to your hand, saving you 3 force later on. The Lifts give you a nice recyclying 5 later on. 

A Step Backwards are needed to win the podrace, but also can be used later on to retreive the ONE QGJ in the deck {wish I had more of the Jedi}.  And I wish I had more then just 4 ASB’s.

If their playing senate, lure them into thinking you have no senate, then take control with Yarua, Tendau, and Mas Amadda. Once you take control, make sure Yarua and Mas stay there. Mas sets up a nice little side-retreival, and Yarua hads more to the drains.

Use Mindful to get Malastare. Since most DS decks don’t run Space in EP1, you can control it early.

Well, here’s the deck. I have had some problems posting this, so if this doesn’t turn out right, sorry, and I’ll repost another version.


THANK YOU, FAIR REVIEWS PLEASE.
