Strategy: 

Drop, drain, and retrieve like a mofo. Let Lando pimp in his ride at the Casino. Drop your slaves and hunters and make the dark deal. If yo white boy opponet drops his white boy mains, it aint no thang. Just kill em off with yo guns. This deck is quick yo. Beats all those little white boys who think they can play.

vs. proft. I like to call this deck the KKK. All their characters are white, except lando but he's already on your side. Yo pimpin and drains at CC will  kill off the white boys. Jus protect your lando with his slave and ride and it's all good

vs. MWYHL. You opponet might think  their little testing is gonna hurt yo drains. Helll no! Get big black to bespin, flip and laugh.

vs. Bring him before me. Don't deploy Mara (The only imperial) and it's all good.

Peace out!
