Strategy: 

Deck Change - Many people have addressed this, so I will take out the Nabrun and one test 6 for 2 more OOC’s. 

OK, in response to reviews, my meta is more open dark decks that do damage than turtle decks. Also, there are quite a bit of space decks and the home one and falcons will take care of that.   

Response to Reviews:
I have tried this before with 3 test 6s, and it worked well, also about the I will win worlds some day...well its been my dream for like since I started playiing, but my mom wont let me go...so that sucks

Card Choices 
Test 6 - pull with the training area to put on colo claw fish or track with threepio
Stone pile - Takes 2 cards from their hand, very cool
Nabrun - very cool card

Early game - First turn, get out Dagobah and Yodas Hut if possible. You should use DDTA to grab They Win This Round and then draw if u dont have a couple guys. Always let them make the first move, unless its in space. You should wait till they have deployed and drained so you can they win this round it until you play guys. Anyway, you should be getting the other systems out and drawing to get the super home 1 (ackbar, thaneespi, and haashn). Use H, C, and the F to knock out early space. Against hunt down use Corran or TT to knock out visage, unless its only hurting them (via Honor). 

Mid Game - you should probably have already retrieved once with They Win This Round, and should control a site. Get the home 1 in space and drain there. Use mains and resiliences to wipe them off of the ground. You should probably control a site and be draining there.

End Game - Well, this phase isnt really that important for this deck. You should have either killed all of their resources or failed miserably, which means the game was decided before this point. 

This is a cool deck I decided to resurrect except with a different platform from an earlier form. Thanks a lot for reading and reviewing.
