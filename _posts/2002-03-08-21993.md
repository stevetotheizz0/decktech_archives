Strategy: '

I am still new on the EP1 Closed Enviornment Tournaments. (I have ran more than I have played in.)So any advice will be helpful.


This is mainly a space deck

-Deploy Systems (Use First part of Mindful of the Future)

-Use Get to your ships to deploy matching pilots to ships.(If any systems are out)

-Start deploying a group of Jedi,  then use Odin to transfer to your opponets ground forces.

-(IN THIS DECK)The power is in the numbers not in the destiny.

-Pod-race to get some force back.

 This is a power-deck.

Easy for players like me.
