Strategy: '

Hi everyone, this is a test deck, for review only and once I see if it got good reviews (I hope) I will play it in a up coming tournement.
 Here is the strategy
I get rendilli, emporor and a docking bay first turn, then then rest of the deck is quick hits, Kir Kanos with a force pike the I set for stun of of the light sides characters, so I have power 5, a weapon that can make your character power =0 and you have none of that (if only two characters there), thrown in another character and thats two destiny for me, that is at least 2-3  battles I will win on ground, then I bring down ZIM and another Bounty hunter ship and beat there, so that is a total of five or so battle I have won, I get Luke, bring him to the throne room, meet up with palpitine, have a cup of coffie, have a duel or two, sign a contract and Luke become Luke skywalker, lord of the sith.

pretty cool huh.

Tell me what you think.
