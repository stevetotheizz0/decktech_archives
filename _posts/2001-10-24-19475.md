Hi to @ll

First of all thanks for reading my deck, I hope you could give me quite good reviews, if you have any questions, please d-mail me and I’ll respond to all of your questions.


Now my deck...

I made ral ops once againn, it’s my favorite deck, and it’s quite good too.

The first turn should look like this

You pull out rendili,activate, deploy DS2Docking bay, deploy Jungle, deploy any cheap character to docking bay.

With avarage firs hand you should be able to flip on 2-3 turn, agains WYS it may be 4-5 but you should be able to win anyway.

But you should never flip unless you have something moving or deploing as a react, it’s a MUST.

After Fliping you must pull out Establish Control and Much Anger In Him and Responsibility Of Command Combo, you should win without any problems if you deploy both of this things. You can also count on some retrives from First Strike and Empire’s New Order (it’s great against WYS).

It might be a small problem if the opponent have Oonee ta,, there’s a special strategy if this situation occurs. You only deploy Jungle do ralltiir and wait for your opponent to deploy a beatdown squad, so now you don’t have to worry about them, and they won’t drain you. When you draw a ralltiir location or two, flip in one turn and the problem is solved (MAIH and ROC combo will also be helpful).

In the mid-game you should have working Imperial Decree on table, it’s a great card. making it work migt be a little rough agains WYS, but they won’t be able to control 4 systems if they try, you could alwys make them pay for that.

So it’s about all of main rules when playing this deck, believe me it’s quite effective, try it for yourself.

Thanks for reading
