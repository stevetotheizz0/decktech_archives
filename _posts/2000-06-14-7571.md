Reaction to Reviews
Yes there is a Main Power Generators in this deck (Don't be fooled).

Strategy
Set up Hoth Base with 3 sites and Echo Base Garrison. Use EBG characters (Zev, Hobbie, Wedge) to setup EBO fast.
It's easy to get a Tatooine site by scanning your Reserve Deck with ANSB and EBG. Insurrection can get the T DB and adds 2 to forfeit of the EBG pilots.
Use ANSB to get Tatooine and Hoth (if needed) to set up Tatooine Celebration.
With EBO the super falcon is deploy 8, power 10, three destinies and Force drain +2 at systems. You can use the other ships / pilots with Haven to drain at Hoth.

All suggestions are welcome.	 '
