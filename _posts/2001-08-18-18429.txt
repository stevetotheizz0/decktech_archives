Strategy: 

I now know that HFTMF can be played with hidded base. I was wrong. I dont know why, but i always thought you couldn’t do both a starting interupt and an objective. I will post a new deck either today or tommarrow, with hidden base. Thanx every one for the comments. Please, wait for the new deck to rate, dont rate this one anymore.

Like i said, i will post Squadron Attacks v4.5 either today or tommarow. Keep a look out. Again, thank you to all who informed me of my mistake. It’s nice to know people actually care enough to help others make better decks!! People used to just give bad ratings for the hell of it, like a year ago. Im glad to see that has stopped.
