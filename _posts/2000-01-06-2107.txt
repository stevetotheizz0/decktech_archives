Strategy: 

Use Hidden Base to pull Dagobah, then pull Yoda's
Hut out same turn.  Once Tatooine is out, get the
celebration set up, and start draining on Tatooine
and retrieving a little each turn with
Celebration.  Lots of EPPs and fattys will hold
the ground, and there's enough ships and pilots to
at least hold Tatooine, plus Claws to block drains
in space.

Against Ops:  Draw Their Fire/Frozen Assets/Beatdown crew

Against Hunt Down: Duel protection in the form
     of Glancing Blow and Courage of a Skywalker,
     plus Jeroen Webb/Transmssion Terminated to
     cancel Visage, and be careful deploying Luke and
     Obi while Vader isn't on the table.

Against Big Blue: Win the drain race, and claw the ships
     at Kiffex and Endor (or wherever their two best
     drain spots are at).

Against Numbers: Pound on whatever gives them their
     numbers, and use Tunnel Vision to find the
     DFATD.

Against ISB: See Ops.

It's a pretty straightforward deck to play, and it's a bunch of fun.

As always, rip it up and make it better.
