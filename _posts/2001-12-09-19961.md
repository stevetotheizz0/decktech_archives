Strategy: '

Okay, first is first. Once you play your starting stuff immediately grab Rendili with YCHF&MP if you start with it. Then draw your hand. If you opponent is playing Hidden Base sac YCHF&MP if they and get Security Percautions. If you get Dark Rage get Deep Hatred or if you have Deep Hatred already then deploy it. Otherwise you will got one of them by drawing over time. Then you get your locations out and get Vader out on the table ASAP. If Deep Hatred is out place combat cards on Vader for dueling or any of your Jedi if your opponent is playing Lightsaber Combat. Then get you guys on the ground with their lightsabers and drain. If your opponent has played revolution cancel it with Evader and play I have you now to add battle destinies aginst rebels of ability >2 ADD 2 IF LUKE with Crush The Rebellion. Crush also alows you to lose a force to cancel Clash Of Sabers. Use Elis Helrot to jump to your opponents sites and duel them with Vader and be sure to use Deep Hatred. Use It Could Be Worse &Ommni Box to screw up tracking. Place a 7 on colo and that is a great battle destiny Control space with your starships and place extra characters not in use on them for forfit. If you opponent is playing space you have got to suprise them. Use U-3P0 to eliminate a force drain at a site.
