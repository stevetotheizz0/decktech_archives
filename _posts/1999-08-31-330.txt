Strategy: 

Basically just try to flip your objective as quick as you can w/ 3 sites out.  Trooper Cadets can be pulled from reserve w/ the objective in case you are short on Imperials.  A leader at the SPO will boost your characters power and forfeit.  After you flip you can start fishing out what you need to win you the game, Imperial Arrest Order is important cause it prevents a Nabrun beatdown and gives you great forfeit.  Decree and -1 drain is killer against most decks.  If you can keep the objective flipped it's pretty tough to lose w/ this deck.  That being said, a good LS Operative deck will give you big trouble by adding additional sites to Ralltiir to flip your objective, not much you can do about this I'm afraid, it's the 1 major flaw w/ this objective.
