*****EDIT***** (3/9/01)
For those of you who keep saying ”unoriginal” just don’t review.  That hasn’t stopped you from continuing to rate Ralltiir 5 stars and Hunt Down 5 stars when they aren’t original.  Plus, all Scum decks are basically the same.  Thank you very much.

For those of you who DO see the power of this deck in a good players hands?  Thank you for rating well and realizing the power of this deck.  And thanks to Hunter and Praskac for making it viable.
*****END EDIT*****

For those of you who don’t know how to play the deck, read Hunter’s strategy for ”Scum 2K done RIGHT”.  It’s the best for this deck.  Like he says, activating 13-15 force on turn 2 will happen EVERY game unless some freak accident happens.

No SAC protection because it’s dead.  It beats everything dead.

Oh, and if you’re going to review bad, then don’t review.  Thank you.
