Not that I really give much of a damn, but I would think my religious preference (or my displaying of it) shouldn’t affect how one reviews my Star Wars deck. I’m also white. Dock a star for that, too


I’m an idiot. I never realized that Don’t Underestimate Our Chances is cancelled by A Useless Gesture, which you’ll see 99% of the time. Drop it for I Hope She’s All Right, because Senate TIEs is apparently the deck to beat nowadays.
