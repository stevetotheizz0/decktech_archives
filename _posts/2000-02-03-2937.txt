Strategy: 

Use the objective to help set up Dark Deal. The
characters are meant for fighting, so don't be
afraid to until you can set up Dark Deal. After
you have the heavy draining going on, drop Lando
and a few friends (for 'company') at the Casino
and start playing sabacc. Track the Masterful
Moves and you should be winning every time. It
really bugs people when you never lose at sabacc.
Between the heavy drains from you and your force
retrieval from sabacc, your opponent doesn't have
much hope.
