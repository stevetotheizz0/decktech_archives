UPDATE 

Take out 1 Obi-Wan With Lightsaber, 1 Han With Heavy Blaster Pistol, General Calrissian, Wedge RSL, Nien Nunb, Keir, X-wing Cannons, Gold Squadron 1, Red Squadron 1, Red Squadron 7, Ronto, Honor Of The Jedi (No Escape gets used too much), Squadron Assignments, 2 Signals, and I’ve Got A Bad Feeling About This.

Put in Home One Docking Bay, Padme, Jar Jar, Shmi, Naked 3PO, Home One, Red Leader in Red 1, Gold Leader in Gold 1, Eopie, A Tragedy Has Occured, Brisky Morning Munchen, Death Star Plans, Insurrection & Aim High, Your Insight & Staging Areas, HFTMF, and We Wish To Board At Once.

This isn’t my main light deck, its just for fun.  So dont tell me to switch deck types.  I use a Rebel Strike Team deck in tournaments and it does very well (dont go by my rating...thats old).

END UPDATE.


Use HFTMF to start with Your Insight & Staging Areas, Insurrection & Aim High and either A Tragedy or Menace Fades.   You have a good chance of either getting The Signal, We Wish To Board, 8D8, or Echo Base Garrison in your hand early.  Deploy 8D8 to Y4 Docking Bay and transit him to the Death Star, then put him on a Lift Tube and move that over and release Leia.  Either use another Lift Tube or Path Of Least Resistance to move her to the docking bay, then put her on the Eopie and transit that to Y4 and move Leia to the war room.  Or use On The Edge to lose Leia and put her in the Bacta Tank, then redeploy her to Yavin 4 Docking Bay.

After you flip your objective, deploy your mains and knock out as many opponents characters as possible.  They wont be coming back.  )  It shouldnt be that hard with some built-in weapons and opponent will have no immunity to attrition.  Also, attrition against opponent is +2.

Houjix & Out Of Nowhere can be used on a suicide mission to permanently eliminate an opponents character, like Vader in a Hunt Down deck (but dont use Luke or Obi-Wan to do it). 

The few ships is all you need to draw destiny, and drawing destiny is all you need to do.  

This deck does well against decks that rely on one character (like Hunt Down or No Money, No Parts, No Deal) because most likely that character is going to be lost at some point in the game and cant come back.

Bounty hunting decks could hurt this deck if they recapture Leia.  If they do, thats what Strangle is for.  '
