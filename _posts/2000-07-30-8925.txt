Strategy: '

The strategy behind this deck is pretty simple. It's your basic Mains beatdown with a little extra force drain courtesy of the three 2-2 sites. Characters like Wedge, Ackbar, and Crix are in here for their forfeit value. Most of the interrupts serve the dual purpose of providing high destiny and countering certain cards. Otherwise, play as your normal mains beatdown.'
