Strategy: '

I've been fine tuning it for 2-3 weeks now. I added
more ground guys so it can do okay versus Search and
Destroy.

This deck is very hard to play and you should play it at least twice against every kind of deck to get a feel of what you need to do againstevery deck to win. Now on to more detailed things 

ROps - This deck eats it alive , Don't wanna deploy
sites until you flip ? Okay I'll just sit on this cloud sector until you find your ship. There is a pretty solid ground force to put some sting if they bait you with a
lone guy. Many ROps don't use enough ships and when
their starfighters are at a difference of 5 you'll
shoot them down with Laser Cannons like all the time.
Power Pivot the Bus.

Bring Him Before Me - Gah , they burn themselves down pretty quickly but it is still a dangerous deck. The
main thing to remember is Emperor's Power , what looks
like an obvious beatdown will turn into a battle
destiny. Give them Luke so they keep losing a little
bit more , if Vader makes a run to the Throne Room
then you might wanna try to beatdown whoever is left
at a battleground. Honor of the Jedi will help.

TIEs - It would take me about 20 minutes to type up
what you have to do to beat TIEs with this deck and I
don't wanna type that much. Play it against the Sword
and the Shield at least 3 times and you should start
to notice something. The main bit of advice that I
can give you is that if you can absorb the initial big battle then your chancing of winning will go up vastly.
The X-Wing Laser Cannons play a huge role as does Wedge cancelling a destiny. I was using Wise Advice and 2 Grabbers but people were Sensing and Altering my stuff
so I switch to Do or Do Not. I'd like to fit one
grabber back in for All Power To Weapons at least.

I think those are the main decks to speak about.
Against ISB its all about Blount and anything space
based you should be alright against. Yoda Stew is
huge in this deck. It lets you draw up to find the
stuff you need and then place back high destiny and
active force for Barriers ,Laser Cannons , It Could Be Worse , the Spiral , and plays all around with their
heads. Enjoy
