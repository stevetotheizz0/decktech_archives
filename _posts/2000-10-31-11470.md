Strategy: '

Strategy

Starting location depends on what opponent plays
1st option JPAC;
2nd TatooineJP.

Show Tawss Khaa as you REP (Species Nimbanel).

Start with Wise Advise, Your Insight Serves You Well and a 3th of your Choice (Insurrection or Battle Plan).

Put all your characters on one site so they remain on table. Spread out later in the game or do the Cantina Shuffle.

Retrieve with OMDH and protect OMDH.

Hunt Down Counter The Circle and Vader’s Obsession. If possible grabble and counter it.
BHBM Give them Luke and do not engage your opponent.
RalOps Can give it a hard time but I don’t expect it that much now.

Yes, I know, there are 2 cards which can make it hard on you Secret Plans & Something Special Planned For Them.
