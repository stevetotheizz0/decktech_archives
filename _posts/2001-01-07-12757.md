Strategy: '

well, your standard Hunt down Deck ) very solid, barely loses and can beat a wide variety of decks

reason for some cards

visage - well, my objective makes me start with it, i guess that’s a good reason, i play two so i can replace it and have a 7 destiny in the deck.  Visage is of course why hunt down wins games, best not to get it cancelled

Epic Duel - i think dueling helps this deck out alot, the destinies from the dueling cards alone makes the deck better.  there are many cards in this deck designed to win duels, best to wait for later in the game to duel i find, so destinies are better set up

only 3 ships - with visage and search and destroy around , a hidden base deck will be losing two force a turn, if they do deploy luke or other mains, just battle them, that’s what the deck does.  the three ships are really in there to try and slow down EBO

IG-88 - clears out sites really well, if they have leia and han or han and chewie, capture one, they lose the other to attrition

Janus- cycles destinies, adds to drain w/emperor

No escape - i don’t like to start with it, i prefer to play it after i lose a key card to the lose pile so i can retrieve it into my hand, especially after they cancel visage

secret plan - too much retrieval out there

Search and destroy - kills hidden base and EBO

Resistance - key against ebo and insert decks

alter - needed to cancel key effects

ghhk monnok and masterful move *2 - these win games, cycle the 6’s, make sure you don’t get beater baddly in a battle and monnok can be deadly

Strategy

get vader first turn ), if you don’t have him in startng hand, go through your deck for a docking bay and hope he is in the force you activated first turn and then pick up

first turn - deploy rendili, and usually executor docking bay (unless you can get a vader to a battleground site), find a vader and nail him with visage oh yeah, don’t forget to get i have you now

vs. profit - deploy fett and jade as your aliens, deploy vader as well, then he shouldn’t be able to budge you, just keep han captive, he will lose force from visage.  you can out battle him with this deck, you are beaten , dark strike, dr. e, and dueling if needed

vs. training - take over your two docking bays, try and get search and destroy early.  make him lose from visage and try to get him with search and destroy so he comes down early.  find secret plans and keep control of the board, pick up enough cards so you can kill any characters he deploys.  the key against training is to not let him keep his characters on the board and have him lose from visage and search and destroy.

vs. hidden base - this matchup is probably the easiest, just get him with visage and search and destroy

vs. beat down - stick to the mobile sites, he only gets two destinies, concentrate on tracking good destinies for a duel, and battle as usual

vs anything else - just get them with visage and take over the mobile sites, beat them down when you can

well, any suggestions for card changes would be appreciated, thanks for reading '
