Strategy: '

****I do not know why, but I messed up...make that only 2 Alter(spelled right here ))  I think thats it, I typed it from memory so what can I say.  Oh and No ships, because This is so fast it wins without it, and I like risk...it didn’t matter in the games I played at worlds anyhow.


Well here you go.  This section should be easy to figure out, but just in case I will say a few things.

First Blount and Cracken are the best spies, because they take care of ISB.  Just deploy generic Docking Bay to Coruscant and that is game for you, with back up of course.  I didn’t face any ISB so it didn’t matter for me.

Against BHBM...just use Undercover until they want to pull there hair out.  Battle when you know you will win, and it usually is a close game against this deck, but this one could win.

Against Huntdown...well watch out for the Duel, set stuff up, as you can see not much protection, but Dueling wasn’t something I thought of at 400 in the morning, but Jedi Luke does subtract 3 so that helps.	I usually best just to Face Vader right away, when they are not ready to duel and battle him, because then Honor and no vader for him will hurt.

Against Court OR Set your Course...OR if you know they have retrieval ALWAYS start Aim High...it works in you half every time.	Otherwise Start Your insight and grab it latter or grab Honor.

This deck is fun and wins

Enjoy
