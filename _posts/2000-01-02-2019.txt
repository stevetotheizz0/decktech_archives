Strategy: '

For strategy on how to play this deck, I refer you to the original, since the two decks play almost entirely the same.
The card changes I made were to combat MWYHL (thanks Mike Fitzgerald) and other non-interactive decks. I added drain-2 sites to help with the lack of Force drain potential in the deck. I also added a third Vader (don't know why I didn't have this in the deck at the beginning). This deck is almost completely immune to Grimtaash, with a total of 52 different cards in it.
If your area isn't very big on inserts, pull a Torture for an I Have You Now.
I notice people are saying a lot about how SAC tears this deck... it's all a matter of meta. This area doesn't see much LS SAC at all, since most DS decks here are HuntDown variants. It was made as an anti-anti-HuntDown deck. A revision on this is to come sometime in the near future.
Also, the term "force choke" is used very loosely. Please keep that in mind... '
