well start  ebo and pod racing if you draw cards that you need for a pod race dysenty rember you can always put them back to your used pile. then get all the plants out. get the x wings set up and drain rember to get i did it in to hand. by this time you should have gotten podracing over with you most likley will win with anikens podracer and all the high dysentys(24). Rember that all the zeros are pullable which means you will probly have prettery good race dysinteys. I took out the docking bay because of in my area everone invades it so that is why i put in the med leb. after winning the podrace then retrive play i did it retrive then get all the x wings out as possible and play all wings report in then you can retrive one everturn with i did it. That helps you a lot. I basically took my really good ebo deck that was really the best deck for light that i ever made( am sorta of a begginer) and worked in some ebo. I never played this exzact deck aginest anybody yet so withe yur help with the cards and i go to my first tourny i will up date the stragty section. i also use the ad order because it is a six thtah is  good for racing and it helps my x wing laser cannons. if you could rate me fariley (like a sorta begginer) then i will return the favor thanks.
