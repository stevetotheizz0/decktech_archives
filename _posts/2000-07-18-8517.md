You Can Either Profit By This.../Or Be Destroyed  '

Strategy: '

Gah No Grimtaashs Take out two cards of your choice and toss those puppies in.

Ok. I left a lot of somewhat obvious stuff out...Wind Chimes,POASkywalker,TV's..you name it.
Well...I don't have room (suggestions needed) and they aren't necessary in the deck (the lom's will be forfeited more often than naught so nothing to retrieve with)

Ok. So we have a profit deck. A profit deck that can choke a horse with 2/0's, Beggar's, Goo Nee Tay, Hnemthe's..,with 2 of big aliens and 3 YWTMTJNow's this deck has incredible speed as well. Start Uh-Oh,Battle Plan,and Wise Advice.

Heres how the deck plays against the popular decks out there

ROps-Profit is know ROps hate. Set up, Oola every turn, drain with Tessek and eloms. Profit damage with Han and Luke blah blah. Luke and Elom backing goes to Ralltiir to clean with beefy immunity. Tawss and Melas rip. Try to get Lando out whether it be by clawing or with melas/hnemthe as pilot.

Big Blue- Gonna be all sorts of these running around whether it be beats, Endor Ops, unique TIEs. mixed space whatever. Oola is Post D*II queen and keep her reaming their hand. Profit needs a lot of activation anyway but with all the 2/0s you should have plenty to Oola every turn.

Manip- Well. SCrews won't matter. Big Aliens can come from reserve. Everything really works well...them rearranging your force pile wont be as bad as most decks with high red card counts. In fact Shasa will hurt them more...just beatdown their small amount of characters.

Huntdown- He he. HDADTJ fades with D*II,  mark my words. ANYWAY Honor of the Jedi takes care of Visage and Oola keeps the Vaders off the table when the Eloms clean the first 1-2 off.

It's just a good non-conventional deck with speed,force advantage, and the most powerful post D*II card-Oola.'
