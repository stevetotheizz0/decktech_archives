Strategy: '

Start with 3rd & 5th Marker and overpower your opponent.
The strength of this deck lies in the amount of character/vehicles/starships. Your opponent thinks it's all over, but it isn't.
It has it's weaknesses, but I like it for it's simplicity.
Give it a try and don't forget to be patient. So keep force and and a striking force waiting.
