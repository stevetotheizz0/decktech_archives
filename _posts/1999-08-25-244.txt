Strategy: '

The key to this deck is achieving a force advantage over the DS so you can use Oola every turn.
Most DS rely on unique male imperials and aliens, so Oola is the perfect compliment to Revo.
This deck used to have 6 Revos but I took 2 out for Scrambled Transmission and Shocking Info.  SCrew decks are popular in Central Texas.
The rest of the deck is self-explanatory.  Tunnel Vision is key to getting Owen and Beru at the Farm, and Harvest provides a duel function Regeneration AND destiny adder for Luke.
