Strategy: '

Please read the strategies before revieuwing


This deck uses the power of high destenies with great power in space.


If you look at the destinies you will see that there are 12 sixes , 1 seven , 1 five and 8 fours.

This does not regard your starting of 7 cards , these destinies are all in your deck


I’ll explain some card choises now 


a) Darth Vaders lightsaber  This might be a bad saber in non-duel decks , but in mine it’s deffinatly a keeper . With this saber + epic duels game text you get a +4 to your duel , getting the edge over a Ben or Jedi Knight luke without a saber.If they don’t deploy the dudes because they’re chicken of losing a duel = He’ll be seeing that EACH of his battle destinies are -2 )+ He won’t be able to use his leia on a proper way


b)Lennox and the Tyrant  Lennox is great in a tractor beam decks because he allows you to do it during controll phaseThe Tyrant even adds 1 extra to your destinies , so i picked this one instead of Thunderflare.


c)Lord Vader x 4?  Well , in my deck , he’s the best vader i can think off , since he gets a minus 2 deploy to executor , has an extra power and immmunity + NO uncontrollable furry risks.

If you then give him a lightsaber  also defence value + 2 and waepon destinies +1  That’s great.


d)Counter Assault  Hmmmmz .... Now why would i put in this card? ))) Track your desenies and make him sufferOnce you get a respectable dammage , he won’t dear to drain if you leave one force left(It works everytime , trust me )


e)Tracor Beam  This card stops those WYS decks , because you suck up all there starships

So you have a falcon there?Well , now he’s mine )


How to play 


First turn , get vader at med chamber.Draw force if you have any left.Get Emperor later on the Holotheatre and draw until you have a mejerrek or a way to pull him.Get nasty in space , and duel him until he criesIf he plays chicken , he won’t be able to do alot , since EACH battle destiny is -2Drain with Chirenau for 3 on each system and get that immunity going thanx to your Admirals order.Final note  You’ll be able to draw battle destiny everywhere because of the gametext from med.chamber.


You’ll see who controls the galaxy soon enough.


Have fun ,

I’m sure if you’re a good player you will win lots of games with it , like i’m doing with this deck right now.


Thanx for reading ,

See Ya


Just another dedicated SWCCG player ,
