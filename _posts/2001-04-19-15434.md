In Response to some reviews


MadHatter - You ask why would i put POTF on the death star - well as i said this deck it taylored against WYS - so POTF makes the DS a battleground - hence i activate 4 instead of 1 at the DS. As for the drain, well sure it’s a big juicy drain or 4,but it gets them coming to my DS, and drop what they are doing (tat celebration, etc) meanwhile, I can still drain at the DS system, with Chiraneau there, it’s a drain of 2 and i can move the DS, so it will always be within 2 parsecs of my other systems, so i get the bonuses (and that ain’t half bad)



Hoostino Yes a quick flipping WYS is tough - but chances are they leave themselves vulnerable, when they do - as for HB mains, I have had my easiest games against these decks -  i have the space to battle them (easily) and as for ground i will sit in the cantina and drain for 5 all game long (POTF on the cantina) - remeber i have some tricks up my sleeve (slash,choke,you are beaten,barrier, darkstrike etc) -  and yes sense and alter could hurt (a bit) but as i said, make changes as you see fit - sense and alter is dead in my area - ( i just recently pulled Oppressive/Tint - for Deng in push 1)


As for the rest i will think about adding Mejjerik, but i don’t really have that many planets, and i haven’t had any problems in the past.


end of Response.





Well how to explain this deck, I originally started using the Sycfa objective for the force activation, and the protection for the emperor to sit at the DS docking bay. I used this platform for my Deceitful duel deck, and i loved it, so i thought i would make a powerful space deck, with strong ground support - WYS is pretty big in my area, so this deck is really metad for wys. Obviously make any changes you feel are necessary. Now to get into a little strategy.


1) Always start Mob points and something special planned - The third effect varies, pending on your opponent and their deck a good idea is to start You cannot hide forever (numbers really suck).


2) before you activate pull the flagship - now you might be wondering why no rendilli fact of the matter is, I dont need the force - usually in my hand i will have someone or better yet the emperor or a imperial command - so if i play Wys, they give me 2 force - with my objective, i am activating 5  plus 2 from the LS equals 7 --- I pull the war room, drop the emperor at the DS docking bay (or play an imperial command for ozzel, drop em for free) and 2nd  turn I am guaranteed 11-12 force - more then enough to get things going.


This deck really is made to adapt, if they go space wait for your goodies and then deploy and wasteem - drop blast door controls, play a set for stun and lat damage - next thing you know, your wailing on the Home 1 for like 22 force (right AL) - if they are going ground you have the mains to deal withem being able to go through your deck really gives you a good idea on your destinies, and what cards are in your activation pile - people really underestimate SET FOR STUN its a huge card - its so easy to drop Dash with this card or if han and leia are giving you trouble in the falcon - get rid of han, or if your opponents space is bothering you, play a Lat damage and then play overwhelmed - get rid of the whole works, its real sweet watching your opponent set up all his space and think hes sitting pretty retrieving force with Tat celebration, then you drop the executor and a few admirals and play your cards - watch his space go to his used pile - and oh yeah Tatooine celebration is canceled.- with the admirals orders in this deck you dont have to worry about major destinies on the ground or deploy your admirals for cheap-cheap. - I will give you a couple of popular matchups.



WYS - Ok, this is a tougher match-up - get your space going right away and set up on tat - drop your cantina, and play a potf on the death star (so you still get your activation) - take over the cantina with the big boys (tarkin,vader and mara) - drop some more space on kashyyk  and find chiraneau - your opponent will have to play your game - and try to stop your drains - try and catch the opponents control - this card can be a pain in the a$$ - dont worry about their retreival, they are gonna do it anyway, just remember to place their card out of play (something special planned) - playing battle order early is good, cause your gonna own space in this game.



HB Mains once again you will own space, or wait for them to drop some space and then pound the snot out of them - as far as ground forces just  hole up in the cantina and play your interrupts accordingly - (maybe keep guri on the ground in this game) over all they wont be able to keep up with you in space.


TIGIH stay inside and make sure you have a bunch of characters together, dont lose battles  - be wary about keeping people on the Death star - very easy way for the LS to stack a card. - just battle smartly and drain accordingly.


EBO get S&D going ASAP - keep your space going strong and keep dengar alive at all costs - catch the organized attack right away, try and find your monnok  right away , and use it - worst case scenario, go to hoth and take that place  over - with the blast door controls you dont have to worry about getting stuck at the outer marker.


Profit You dont see it too often, but its gonna make a comeback - blast doors is a surprise card here - either go after han ASAP or stay away and drain - once again Set for stun is a huge card here, can save you for a few turns (very good late game card) battle plan is key, cause more then likely they wont have space, but if they  do - then you will have the game won - lat damage is huge



those are the key match-ups, I dont  want to go off and list all the other possible light side decks,  you should get the gist of it.



I will go into a  few card explanations.


Lateral damage x2 well we all know what this card does, but 2 makes it twice as good. Most people wont see two coming, when you use one early - most LS players feel safe, they wont expect 2 lat damages. Plus, if they arent ready - this card is a GAME ENDER.


Blast door controls WYS, flip side you cant play sense or alter - so guess what, you wont be getting rid of blast door controls all game - oops sorry you cant play that rebel barrier - oh yeah, profit, sorry cant play narrow escape either - overall just a great card ( and a destiny 5, you cant beat that)


Overwhelmed During deploy phase target a system where you have double the opponents total power. - place all opponents starships there into the used pile. So like i said before, they have a strong space force and you just dont feel like fighting - play a lat damage, then play this destiny 5 wonderful interrupt - and dont worry about their starships at all. (but just remember, they have the starships in there deck, so be careful. dont go spreading out.)


Sniper/Dark strike GREAT CARD - slice and dispose - nuff said


Battle deployment Admirals order - a great card for this deck, A) you have to have both starfighters and capitals present or your  starships are power -2 B) this is the part that i love, at sites related to the system you occupy, your opponent may not draw more then one battle destiny - absolutely perfect for WYS.


Were in attack  position now Admirals order - basically your admirals deploy for cheap on your big blue ships - and your big blue ships get  immunity, or they add some more immunity. Awesome.



So there you have it, the deck I call Deceitful Command - its has only lost in friendly games (cause i didnt have numbers protection) - it currently sits at 11-1 in tournament play - I was gonna post this a while ago, but my provincials were coming up, and i didnt want to give anything away - oh yeah, this deck went undefeated in my provincials (BC, Canada) this deck helped me come in 3rd (missing the final confrontation by 3 differential. )
