Strategy: '

Basic - Simple stuff. Deploy buddy , deploy Op.
Get them in AT-STs ASAP. This deck has a ton of
Battling ability so don't be afraid if they come
after you. Once the EPPs are down you can spread ,
drain , and win. Battle Plan doesn't do jack since
this deck has a lot of Blue to go into space
On to specs 

Y4 Revo ,etc - Start Corulag and the Desert. The
ability to pull out sites really hurts this deck
type and as long as you absorb the initial blow you
win.

HB- With copies of Coruscant and Kessel normal HBs
can for a total of 2 ( 1 at Kessel and 1 at Kiffex )
so you don't even have to probe ; This is why I
like this deck -- I hate having to probe for HB.

MWYHL- Great Warrior kinda sucks but the ability
to drain for about 7-8 or so will still win the
game.

Ops - Start BOrder. There is a copy of both applicable
ABC targets and you'll get the lockdown on them.
Vader and Tarkin can stampede and cause damage on
their planet.

Wrap up - That is pretty much it. Wuher takes care
of A Gift and you can pretty much beat anything else.
You might wanna throw in a Point Man or two if
Order to Engage is popular in your area because that
is pretty much the only way this deck can lose --
or you can throw in a First Strike so that when you
battle you can also retrieve more. Good luck with it.
