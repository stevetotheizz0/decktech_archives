Strategy: '

This deck can get your opponent to lose at least 20 force during each of your control phases.

You can do this by getting Palpatine out early at the swamp so your opponent has a hard time taking him out because he has to pay +3 force to battle there.  You then build up Imperials at the Yavin 4 sites you’ve pulled with your objective or you can build up in space at Yavin4.  Once you have the space built up you can play tour Admiral’s order. Once you’ve got the ground covered by Imperials you can play Rebel base occupation, Organa’s necklace, and overseeing it personally.
With those you will have a drain of 3 at every Yavin 4 site, your opponent will be losing an additional 1 force for every yavin site you occupy and 1 more additional force for each site your commander or general controls from the admirals order.

Against Hidden base
  You will have a lot of direct damage your opponent can’t cancel and if you get your ships out at yavin your opponent won’t want to play with them.

Against There is good in him
  You should be able to outbattle your opponent so he doesn’t get a significant amount of cards on i feel the conflict to turn vader.

Against Profit
  Your opponent will be losing more force than you will be.  You should be able to get your full setup before your opponent gets their direct damage and good drains out. Battle order will slow them down too.

Against EBO
  This can prove to be a problem but you should comeout triumphant. Your opponent will have more force loss than you would. You just have to get everything out fast.

Well, that’s my first deck i’ve ever entered on Decktech and I hope you all like and use it.
