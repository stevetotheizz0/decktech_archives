Strategy: '

This is an all around good deck. It has everything a deck could have power, space power, big drains, capturing, retrieval, and interrupts which annoy the opponents to death, o and scum and villainy. This is an AOTBS deck with a court twist. The main idea is to get Xixor off coruscant and onto Tatooine or onto his ship. On the first turn, get the DB for coruscant out, deploy a hunter there, and move xixor there. Next turn deploy the DB for tat and move them there. Deploy other aliens and tat sites and vigos there for extra drain. When they try to attack you, hidden weapons them with Fett or Jodo, to take out some of their characters, then just kick their @$$. Take the captured characters (with a bounty, preferably) to the Dungeon. With Fett they will be valuable for some big retrieval. Then play sonic bombardment on an alien to make them lose force. Throw down scum ASAP and they won’t be able to touch you. 

ANYONE READING THIS DECK FOR THE FIRST TIME REFER TO THIS BEFORE REVIEWING IT PLEASE IT HAS SEVERAL IMPORTANT CHANGES.

To Review Yes I agree 7 Hidden Weapons are too many. Another Xixor and Jodo will go in, for two Hidden Weapons. I was meaning to put 4-Lom with rifle in but I forgot. He’s going in for another HW. Bossk in ship is very good and I forgot about him, so he’s going in for Scum which does not help me much. I think Fett in ship should go in since he is power 7. The second stinger and Virago can be taken out. I think Hutt Bounty should definetely go in for Han vs. Profit. Ai Ai Aggggg should stay in and if they don’t have a mains deck I can lose it. Monnok and Defensive Fire are good for annoying the other player so they get out of sync. Hutt smooch is for all the undercover spies people are playing right now in my area. I agree that I need more characters, but I don’t really have any more that can go in. The Emporer can now that Scum is out, but I don’t know of anyone else. Maybe I should add a second Guri, but I don’t know.

Matchups

vs. Hidden
Get the hunters in their ships up and do some attacks on the ships-after they’ve spread out and are convinced you have no ships. When they flip, make sure you probe quickly so they can’t cancel your drains. Get your hunters on the ground to drain. 

vs. EBO
A tougher matchup because they will have too much space power for you to attack and too much drains for you not to attack. The main thing to do is scrap the drains on tatooine and go to hoth. Attack their people in the echo base, and don’t let them get EBO out. If they do manage to get it out, try to get some hunters in their ships in your hand and do an attack. With Zuckuss you probably won’t have to forfeit, so you can go from planet to planet and attack. 

vs. Training
ummmmmm....has anyone ever seen a good training deck? I don’t think I really need to elaborate on this because well......it would be pretty easy to beat.

vs. Profit
A fairly easy matchup. Swarm the palace and capture han. Put him in the dungeon and retrieve, or run away with him and they can’t drain. Keep his objective on the 0 side and you’ll have a good shot at winning. Starting aliens-Fett and Snoova.

vs. Operatives
Swarm the ops planet with hunters and battle. Capture the people that make the ops powerful, and they’ll be dead. No imperials or walkers, so the objective does almost nothing. Deploy scum and retrieve 2 each time you beat them up. Just don’t let them get too powerful by beating them up a lot, or else their drains will take over and beat you.

I don’t know what I would do against a throne room mains because I have only played against one. Any comments would be appreciated, especially about a matchup against throne room mains. Thanks
