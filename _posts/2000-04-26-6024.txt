Strategy: '

This is mostly just freeing han and drain and making them lose to the objective. The revos are for Obi's Hut and Mos Eisley if you want. On Obi's Throw him down with proficiency and a saber and drain the whole time. You can do the same with mos eisley if you want, but only if you have enough force already. Luke and Ben Should keep most people out of there. Try for a 1st turn flip, unless you would rather retrieve ten later, although they could guard him more by then. Thanks for reviews. '
