Starting Stuff

I choosed to start with "only" a Signal, because of the lack of three effect that are immun to Alter in this deck.

Most of the time, i use the The Signal to pull Goo Nee Tay, I made this choice because of the enormous amount of Force Icons i am giving my opponent. Anyway, if you play against something like Court [which makes Goo Nee Tay obsulete] start with Honor of the Jedi [works especialy well against Court]


Okay, lets take a look at the locations


Naboo Theed Palace Generator Core

Naboo Theed Palace Generator

These two are pretty clear, because I have to start with them.


Naboo Theed Palace Throne Room

Another Theed Palcace Interior site to have fun with, no problem with Qui Gon in the middle of the 3 sites - he can reach everyone.


Naboo Theed Palace Courtyard

This site I choosed mainly for the fact that - if the opponent plays the Anti-Nabrun Effect, that i can still leave the planet if I had to.


Coruscant Jedi Council Chamber

Home One War Room

Two batteries to speed things up, nice bonus - if a rebel is in the war room the Home One is a little bit cheaper.


Next Stop The Characters

Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight (3x)

Obi-Wan With Lightsaber (3x)

Qui-Gon Jinn, Jedi Master (3x)

The Jedis of your choice - for each interior site one - that worked very well for me. After the palace were cleaned from those Dark Side Jedis.


Chewie, Enraged (2x)

Han with Heavy Blaster Pistol (2x)

Leia with Blaster Rifle (2x)

Lando Calrissian, Scroundrel (2x)

The support troops, the problem with the objective could be, that you are not allowed to battle where you have a Jedi, so you need a strong non-jedi character base to make some damage.


Corran Horn

Owen Lars & Beru Lars

Threepio With His Parts Showing

Twass Khaa

These are the supporter of the supporter ;-)


Toys for the Jedis

Anakin’s Lightsaber

Luke’s Lightsaber

Qui-Gon’s Lightsaber

Qui-Gon Jinn’s Lightsaber

I think thats pretty clear, and needs no explanation.


Space ...

Home One

Not much, but if you play against a DS space deck, you can disrupt with this fighting machine, add Luke, Han, Leia and you have the Super-One.


The Effects

An Unusual Amount Of Fear

For sure I want to play with Defensive Shields


Draw Their Fire

Nice Retrieval, or as a surprise if my opponent has no force left - so he cannot play a interrupts.


Goo Nee Tay

As I wrote abouth, giving away so much force icons, i need something to compansate it.


Honor Of The Jedi

Good against Court, HDADTJ and a lot of other stuff.


Lightsaber Proficiency

Force Drain baby, or a Power 13 Luke ;-)


Projections Of A Skywalker (2x)

Always a good card, with some options of usage

Mainly I use it to reduce opponents force drains at their location, but its also a good effect to play if someone invated your palace.


Interrupts

Alter & Friendly Fire

One Alter not much, but its worth because of cards like Lateral Damage, Bad Feeling have I and so on - and by the way - A Friendly Fire was always a nasty card ;-)


A Jedi’s Resilience (2x)

mmm... that needs no explanation.


Gift Of The Mentor (3x)

To grab those Lightsabers very fast.


Jedi Presence (2x)

Thats one of the keys to this deck, if you cleaned the palace from dark jedis you can go for it - with cards like Nabrun Leids, High-Power Characters - this card can win you the games.


Mindful Of The Future (3x)

This card is a must, because your other Naboo Location are not pull-able, so you need this card to get them, anyway, it’s a used destiny of 5, can become handy for lightsaber combat.


Nabrun Leids (2x)

Thats pretty clear ;-) Beatdown ...


Run Luke, Run (2x)

Really perfect if someone tries to battle away that lone EPP Obi Wan on Naboo, also perfect against HD to protect your Luke if he has no combat destinies.


The Signal

Want to grab my Starting Effect.


Were You Looking For Me?

C3PO - where are you ?


We Wish To Board At Once (2x)

Another easy 5 to use, and a nice five for combat.


The Defensive Shield is pretty clear, so i am not going to explain it card by card.


Strategy

Okay, first you should get some Jedis down to make some early damage [force drains]. If necessary reduce his drains with PoaS.

My experienced showed me, that 5 & 6 are enough to do the lightsaber combat - and to win it. 

But you can wait with that until he is deploying a Jedi to your sites, because so you have 2 deploy phases to gather those two high destinies.


If you cleaned the first wave of Jedis you can set your course for revenge. If possible with Nabrun Leids, if not, use EPP Obi and the other task force characters + Jedi Presence. 


In the bad case, you cannot get rid of the Jedi on Naboo, you still can win - because you can attack him elsewhere - with Han, Leia, Chewie & Lando - that could be so devastating ;-)


I have no idea what i else should i write, because the deck worked for me that way ;-)
