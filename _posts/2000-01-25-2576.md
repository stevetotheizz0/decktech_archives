Strategy: '

Start Do or Do Not as your Starting Effect, this will help againest Sense Heavy decks, Don't Cancel Force drains with the Controls ,they're for canceling sense. Basicly the object is to wait untill you have lost ten force then spring han. Don't battle on his terms ,he should never have a succsesful battle, with 5 Narrow escapes, 3 its a Traps  Just run away ,he'll still lose force from the Objective. Then when all your mains are out and YOUR ready strike hard, use Weapons Levitation and Clash of Sabers to Disarm him so he won't hit Han and then take him outThere is no Space in this Deck, if they play Space free Han then use the B'omar Monks,Sabers,etc to drain, Spread out too so you can maximize the damage. Carefull Planning can catch him off gaurd, I have won several games in this deck because they put all there characters to one site with Elis and then battled thinking with no force I couldn't get away (*evil grin* ) then playing this drawing a five and. leaveing

Good Luck and MTFBWY
