Strategy: '

this is my attempt at tatooine mains and draining at jabbas palace.


first turn pull audience chamber and deploy any other sites for activation and either deploy charcters or just draw or save up. hopefuuly have a maul first turn for backup for other charcters and use stuff like imperial barrier to stop beatdowns.


after that get expand the empire on audience chamber deploy 3 aliens and get hutt influence out- you`ve got a twilek and we must accelerate our plans so then they can`t cancel force drain or modify it in any way. audience chamber game text deploy GALLID.


you`ve lightsabers and presences and gallid to enhance your force drains and they can`t cancel them. start play scanning crew to slow them down and a peek at thier hand.


you are beaten to exclude a chracter, maul strikes for adding battle destiny or to get a lightsaber . you`ve got space power and beat them down.


against wys

get maul straightaway and start deploying aliens and charcters. cards like imperial barrier and you are beaten will hurt them. guri stops all the adding battle destiny cards and the objective.

try to kick them off in space.


against hb or ebo

setup up as fast as possible, if you fear beatdown get interrupts to hand, if not deploy and force drain them to death and you`ve get some space to kick them off.


against profit

deploy mara jade and snoova to audience chamber using their objective, deploy weapons on them then their stuffed. cards like you are beaten and imperial barrier hurts them. get secret plans asap.


there is good in him

simple, setup up as fast as posssible, use scanning crew to delay madine and solo and drain them out really quickly and keder the black to cancel one of their force drains. '
