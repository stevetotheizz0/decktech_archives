Alright...another retrieve...battle...drain deck


Go get your opponent with the mains

Drain them

You lose something important and retrieve

Yoda kills some attrition


Why these cards are in there


Wise Advice Adds one to training destiny, let’s my imm effects deploy for free, and if people do get sense and alter I get saved (that’s just a bonus)


Don’t do that again Kills mob points, and I can take an Imm Effect, I can’t think of anything else to start with, can YOU?


Obi-Wan Kenobi I don’t have EPP Obi’s so I can get the saber using Gift if I need to


Anger Fear Agression Love that card


Projection Slows drains down


Frozen Assets Stops the opponent with Draw Their Fire, planning to Ghhk? or Barrier? NOT ANYMORE and what’s this? NO force for the Ax too bad


It Could be Worse Slow down drains again, if you use it on drains you don’t have to worry about It’s Worse cause it’s ignored with Test 1, otherwise be caustious


Changing the Odds Opponent can’t find something, check for It’s Worse, just in case, and get ride of it, he planning to fry you with Force Lightning, get ride of it, plus subtracting 1 from the destiny and Yoda gives you a immunity <4 which is cool


I haven’t played this deck much, I wanted to get some response first, I’ve only played vs a AoTBS deck, it does a good job if they’re playing Docking Bays. Other wise you’ll have to wait until I play somemore decks and then I’ll update it   '
