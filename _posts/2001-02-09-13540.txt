Strategy: '

well if you’d like to take out the grimtash & the  scrambled you can add 2 i’ll take the leaders

aside from that not much to change.......you can even replace them with 2 more oganized....or just 1 & some other card.. a grabber or it’s a trap for the snipers.....whatever 


also....play this deck fast..deploy a guy to his system 1st turn with his ship..easy to do..costs 2 force & drain of 1 on turn 2..then repeat  & deal with him if he comes

try to get the following together

dont underestimate our chances & power pivot(obvious combo)

rebel barrier &it can wait(play it can wait ..then raly everything there & the barrier it then kill him in that turn)

the grimtash you can get into hand ever turn & make sure he dose not get more than 12 in hand.....then bring him to 8..BUT the tech part here is on the starting turns  when looking in deck....count everything every turn & see what is in you’re force pile.................well have fun lads
i’m of to sleep
