CheezWhiz What do you mean you can’t understand the deck list are you retarded?


Bane Malar When did I say Luke would be in all the battles?


Cyrus Yes I totally agree with you People need TO LIGHTEN UP. And yes I AM Jesus Christ, I Can’t leave this Dam* world for a thousand years and everybodys turned so solemn


--------------END UPDATE------------------

Before the strategy section here are a few descriptions and combos of cards and why their REALLY here ;-).



BACK DOOR-Luke and Qui gon’s Sex hideout the only people with keys are Luke, Qui, Padme, and Leia.


LEIA and PADME-Who else is going to keep all the guys company.


KAL FAHL C’NDROS-Tapes everything that goes on inside the Back Door


QUI GONS DETACHABLE PENIS-so at night he can go to all the nightclubs as a crossdesser with Obi Wan


CORRAN HORNY-Makes Leia get Horny


CHEWBACCA PROTECTOR-Who else is going to protect Leia’s Body from any unwanted visitors?


LANDO IN MILLENIUM FALCON-Has a Satellite so he can hear everything that goes on in the Back Door.


BACTA TANK-Leia likes to look at naked people inside the tank.


NABRUN LEIDS-When Aurra gets pissed Nabrun comes and quickly moves the victims.


WOOKIE-Hairy People are Huge Studs





Ok. Heres the Real Deal.



Most of the cards in the deck are pretty self explanatory. I have played TIGIH since its release and am staying faithful. I believe that its pure power can still outcome other decks. Alot of the characters have permanent weapons also and this really makes the opponent cry.


Well Alot of times the opponent will try and choke you of all force this is one of the problems that comes up in this deck. Their are not too many low deploy cost characters, and could be a problem. In my area people arent that smart though. -). Try and give them LSRS as soon as possible so they can lose 2 force every turn. Ultimatum is an awesome card, cancels all force drain bonuses when you control 3 battleground site or opponents controls non great for all space decks.



Here are some Matchups. 




Endor Ops


Should be Easy with Ultimatum. Just dont let them Get Perimiter Patrol out and running, otherwise you’ll be losing loads of force.



Hunt Down


Ouch. Most likely they’ll attempt to force choke you. This is the hardest matchup, use Nabrun Leids to your advantage.



ROPS


Battle.



AOBS


Same as ROps, they wont be able to capture your mains





I havent played any other decks yet, but email me with any suggestions.


This is my first deck so please put that into consideration when reading.
