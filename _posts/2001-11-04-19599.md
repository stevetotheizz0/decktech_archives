Strategy: '

You will more than likely want to start mob point, No Escape and Crush.


Why?

Well Mob Points is just to pull Exectutor, hey why not start three effects plus they may waste a defensive shield thinking you need it for activation.

Crush, to pull I Have You Now, and Evader/Monnok and you dont have to worry about Clash of Sabers.


No Escape, Honor protection so you dont have a chance to loose it, and you direct damage will always be going through.


Computer is messing up(i have aol) and I will finish the strategy later, please rate my deck and dont give it a bad rating b/c of poor strat, the strat isnt finished but soon will be '
