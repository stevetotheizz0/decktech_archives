Strategy: '

This deck is a solid mains deck that uses EBO fake out not only to throw the opponent off, but to set up the bacta tank combo that is very potent with EPPs.Grab War Room and Echo Garrison first turn. Then pull out all your additional sites and use Garrison to grab bacta tank.I have a backup tank in here because the mains arent nearly as effective if I lose the tank.A good starship selection including redemption for bacta tank purposes.


vs Ties - Hack the emperor off the death star and use battle plan and order to engage against them. Grab all power to weapons and alter dreaded starfleet. 


vs BHBM - A tough matchup, use spies for a possible beatdown vs emperor. Make good use of bacta tank to have reoccuring mains and wear them down as the game goes on. 


vs Hunt Down - There’s no duel defense, you may want to add some if duel is popular in your area.Tunnel vision for the spies and cancel visage asap and drain on the executor.Use tank to wear them down.


vs Scum - Pretty easy game, use sense/alter vs barrier/NSP and other important stuff.Again, wear them down with tank mains.Projections are also helpful here. 


vs Raltiir - Get on their planet early and use tank to keep mains on the planet all game long. Projections helpful here as well.
