Mara’s Stick '

Strategy: '

First turn pull rendili using Mob. pts., get Ephant Mon with power of the hutt, and grab Ex DB with IOA. Deploy Ephant Mon to Ex DB for activation next turn.

Get Vader out as fast as you can. So you don’t have to loose force from visage.

Keep Palpy with his goons, keep Vader with Tarkin, keep Jabba with Fett and eventually move Ephant Mon to Jabba, and put Mara where you need her.

I know what your thinking, EPP Fett and ECC Fett? just trust me on this, if LS is playing heavy ground use EPP Fett, but if LS is playing space heavy use ECC Fett.

Just Remember this, Duel luke and obi whenever possible.
