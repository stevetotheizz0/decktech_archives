Strategy: '

I modifued this deck a little. Drop a force lightning and a vaders obsession for 2 holonet transmissions.

ok this deck sint really mayed for tournament play. I dont think i would use racing in tournament play just b/c lightside has a huge advantage and that can be devistating tot he deck.

reasoning for some cards
darth maul w/saber x3 this card is god when combined with maul strikes and the phantom menace.

AIO/Secret Plans this is used to pull out the sites in the deck to up the destiny and to give places to drain and battle.

5 vaders I use 5 to make sure I get one right off the bat. vader with saber is great for striking and attacking. DLOTS is great for holding down a site. DLOTS with a saber on him is an army along with the mauls at a site solo. mara may need to be with another. 

beatup your aponent and drain them. Visage and the beatdown factor with some retrieval should make this deck have good differentials.

I havent played this deck yet though. So give help on it so I know how to make it better
thanks for any help  '
