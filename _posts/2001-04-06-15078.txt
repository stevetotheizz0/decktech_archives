Strategy: '

As stated this deck fun to play and everybody is always suprised by the Rep choice. The strategy is pretty obvious. Use the wookies, monks, and few mains to flip then over power the enemy with high power and multiple destinies. In the last version of this I played I had Corran Horn. I took him out for Chewie’s Bow.

This deck runs on a theme and is highly alterable. There is not really anything in the deck that can’t be exchange for something else. Experiment... find what work for you. Believe me nothing is cooler than seeing Vader or Mara go down fighting against your wookies. It’s also great when you get to use Chewie’s Bowcaster to knock out the Emperor.

If you play conservatively you really can hold your own against most decks. Just play it safe and beware of DLOTS.

Stupid computer... didn’t mean to have this posted twice. '
