Strategy: 

just get your twix site as fast as you can
go battle where he is and during late game deploy all your cc site get pucumir + other character and finish him
run luke run is tech, its not only a counter to
duel it can bring luke in a fight and its not a
react so if he attack your lone pucumir bring a
character with POLR and luke with run luke run
+ its a 6 destiny
cc is key its indoor so you dont fear AT
 and if you wondering why there is no TT well its because we are both loosing from it so it does matter because i will retrieve it
and  CHYBG and secret plan dont hurt because i have no problem having my 2 battleground and when you activate 20 paying 5 for a retrieve change nothing at all
