Strategy

This deck is built obviously, with ewoks in mind. it also contains some of the main charactors to help in power.


Great forest, Cheif Chirpa’s Hut, and Careful Planning are the starting cards. I chose these sites because ewoks deploy -1 at Chirpa’s hut, and with wokling your ewoks will be +3 power


Ok, first, ewoks, though they mostly have no base pwer, at the right location, with the right cards, you can really get a good beating from ewoks Think about it, you get 4 ewoks at chief chirpa’s hut, they are power of 2 each, thats 8, then you add an ithorian, now it’s power 3 each, power of 12, then you add wokling, now it’s power of 4 each, total of 16. Now, you add DOS, now it’s power 5 each, totaling 20, plus DOS is 24. Thats pretty powerful for a couple of little furry guys.Then you can add to the damage by adding ome weapons, we have Anakin’s saber for the lady, then we have spears, bows, and catapults for the ewoks Go for the spears, and onw you have an extra 4 omre power 28 plus weapons for 4 ewoks and DOS who can argue with that


Now, the way to do it is this, first of all, deploy ewoks at the village or the chirp man’s hut, they are mius 1 for deploy (free or close to it for most ewoks) Then move them out to Dense forest or hidden forest trail where they are power of 2. Then get DOS and ithorians out on table, put them with your ewoks. Deploy wokling, but be carefull not to start a battle there, or you will lose it.


If your opponent happens to try to force drain you, cancel it with Suprise counter assault. Suddenly, you have up to 17 ewoks all deployed for free from your reserve deck Rememebr the math class before....4 ewoks was powerful, imagine 17 un-expected ewoks  ) 


Any way, thats the basics of this deck. It is not a prize winning deck, but its fun, and imagine how great it would be to kill a mains deck with a bunch of fury little guys who sound funny
