Strategy: '

A balanced deck with a good activation.
Start would be Wise Advice if you suspect Sense/Alter, else Battle Plan to slow everything down.
The deck should be played patiently, once you can track the used interrupts or the cards you see with Figrin you can inflict some real damage.
Tibrin is key to the deck, as is order to engage. Flip only at the end of the game or if you are forced to do.
If all this sounds familiar to you, well it is. Its basicly the newest version of the Martin Falke deck I posted after worlds. Now it includes ECC and EJP. Bespin was added to ease the canceling of Dark deal. Transmission terminated was eliminated, with Insurrection you can use your spies, everything opponent deploys to the holotheater is trapped.
