Strategy: '

I left out a Bubo in the deck list 

Starting interrupt is Surface Defence to get the 3 effects. The first thing you should do is to protect the Chamber. Get Greeata, Jabba, Ak rev,
Lirin Carn to the Chamber. Set up S+V. The try to
force your opponent to the ground and then deploy
your musicians and belt them. This is easy since
your musicians are so cheap to bring out. Force your opponent to the ground by the mini visage, Ability, ability, ability, and Search and Destroy.
If you aren't aware of what the musicians do her is a list of them with a description of what they do
Tech Mor not much but he does have 6 destiny
Barquin Dan Force Retrieval
Lirin Carn Make opponent's  characters expensive to deploy (they have to pay an extra force for each musician present)
Rappertunie Can make an opposing caharacter power 0 by drawing destiny greater than ability.
Sy Snootles Gets J'Quille
GreeataYour musicians are depoly 1 less and forfeit +3
Dodo Allows you to peek at a number of cards in your force plie = no. of musicians.
Ak rev Get a musician during your control phase
KithabaPower= 1+ ability of highest ability charcter present
Rystall Force Retrieval
Lyn Me Subtract opponent's total power.
Umpass Stay Musicians at same site are power +2 and immune to attrition less than 3.
Plaese give me some feedback.
