                         ***UPDATE***


OUT Central core, CCDB, TatDB, TAT Cantina, Ghhhk/TRWEU

INCome Here You Big Coward, Kashyyyk, Adm Motti, SSPFT, 

Executor DB  and the TINT/OE is supposed to be just Oppressive Enforcement (combo dosent add to destiny of my SD`s)


get Piett  via Imp Command or drawing and pull merrejk who gets your systems use a Imp Comd for Chiraneau  and drain for tons and use the Imperial Navy`s ”fleet of doom”  to control space and the game I use the D* sites for activation in case merrejk is stubborn and wont show.if I have to I can block a drain with any scrub (see WYS) Thrawn is an an auto 2 destinies and Palleon on the chimarea is tech vs flipping Hidden Base (they can get from system to system) 


WYS . Realistically if you do your destinies right and use the massive power of your destroyers to your advantage, you shouldn’t lose. The Outrider is a pain, use Lateral Damage. The Super Falcon is dangerous, but only if your opponent’s destinies are particularly high. Imperial Command will be helpful I can block drains on the d8 with any scrub, and I take no damage 


Hidden Mains You may not be able to handle the ground power of the mains not on the D* , In space, again the Super Falcon is a problem, but otherwise you should be okay. In this match, speed is essential, get your drains in space set up and secure and start draining like a mofo. 


EBO Dominate systems early. Massive activation makes this fairly easy. Invade Echo Base if you can, you have plenty of power characters that aren’t needed in space. If you hurt them bad enough early on, they won’t be able to challenge you in space later. Resistance is good if you really screw it up 


Test Invade Dagobah with BH ships. Try and kill the apprentice and/or Yoda if you can pull off the invasion. Drain AS FAST AS POSSIBLE , Imp command the super Falcon. battle the Mains     '
