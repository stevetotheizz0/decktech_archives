Strategy: '

This a pretty basic, but solid BHBM deck. It can hold it’s ground against most anything. Basically sense or alter what you can, then grapple anything else. Play circle on ben, then kill off whatever else with your sabers and dr. evason. Play lateral Damage on thier mon calamaries and kill off with executor.
AGAINST PROFIT
Either start Mara and Jabba, or Jabba and evason. Then get everyone to jabba’s apalce. Be shure to sense SOWLY, so they can be cheap. Get out secret plans to stop retriving by opponent. PLay sniper on han, and win
AGAINST HB
get out secrutiy precations and probe. Sense and retvival cards
AGAINST EBO
Start Decree, and secret plans. move all your guys to hoth and beatdown and drain. Kill off in space with BH ships and lateral damage

anything else
react to what opponent does pretty much
