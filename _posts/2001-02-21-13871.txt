Please take your time to read the strategy 

This is an very improved version of a yet good deck.
Thanx to the review’s of many professional players I was able to make various changes.
The important one is Retrival.I now added 2 Off and 2 On the Edge and also Tatooine Celebrations.
I’m now able to get lost cards back and thanks to the I’ll take the leader i’m able to drain for 2 on the docking bays.
Furthermore , I improved my character addition , having now 6 jedi’s and 2 lando’s , so I can 
use them quicker in combat
I added a OOC/TT , due demand + a glancing blow vs Hunt Down.
And Aquiris is a great system for early activation.
For the rest the deck is quite the same .

If you don’t understand some of my card choises , other then the ones I explained here ,
Look to my first version of the deck  Power of the light Side.
You’ll find it a very stabil deck with lots of battleling power and retrival options + a nice activation.


Try it out , I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t be dissapointed. 
BTW Thanx for reading it out 


If you have any questions regarding this deck , feel free to send a message.
I will add strategy upon review and try to update this deck even after new sets.
Please ONLY post good critics , such as most players in decktech do.
