Strategy: '

When I said don’t take it to 10 tournaments in a row, I wasn’t kidding.  I have a second deck, my EBO, (see my page) which is really my more solid deck, doesn’t use any of these cards, but is definitely expected.  This was a brainstorm that has turned out very nicely.  YCHF isn’t that common in my area, so the #’s aren’t a problem to get though.  I will always have at least 9, and since almost all dark decks pack the Vader’s and Mara’s, getting across a force loss of 5-8 isn’t that hard.  My retrieval works very well, and with to Chimes, TVision duo card, and 4 Baragwins, getting 1-3 is never a problem. The possibility of canceling 3 drains a turn (2 HB, Bargaining Table) is also great, but not really necessary to this deck.  Usually, you can be draining for 5-7 also, and you are fairly safe with hyper escapes, although Sense can hurt.  DODN/WA would be a good addition, but I can’t seem to get another one after I traded my one away.  Finally, my destinies are really good in this deck, which always helps and can be deadly with Suprise Assult.  I have 184 total destiny out of a start of 55 cards.  That is about a 3.35 average right there, and if you delete the 5-7 systems I get out and an eight card hand to start, my destiny goes to about 160 for 41 cards.  That is almost a four destiny average.  


If you’re going to tell me to put in DODN/WA, or tell me numbers won’t work, don’t bother.  Just remember it depends on your meta, and I already know the former. -)
