Strategy: '

Ok Pretty Standard I start Opressive, IAO, and Mob Points first turn use mob points to pull kuat and drop yards on it or Use the Twi’Lek you got in your hand drop Ephant ASAP at the bunker and Vader/Tarkin/or Emperor and his cronie Janus there with him Use merrejk to the fullest same also with chiraneau Your early drains pulled off by the SD’s You can Pull w/ KDY early overpower them.  Now for the section where i explain Motives to some cards

Janus Greejatus
Ok janus is a god you know it i know it and scrubs over the rainbow and through the woods know it he’s a LS ishi who when deployed w/ the emperor is killer the combo is 6 power battle destiny immune for janus <3 and for the emp always you get a boosted force drain and you can put a card usless now into you used pile and maybe replace it with a good one from reserve i said it before and i say it again Janus is A GOD

Imp Code Cylinder
Ok now i found it in a D Con Report techish and quite interesting because if you get it early enough half the imps in this deck are leaders and as long as you get one on an SD or to one of the endor sites you can check their deck look for tech and overall scout them out. Total Tech

It’s Worse
Ok this one was a total Meta-game choice the Scrub Card of choice in my area (NE Wisconsin best SWCCG here =)	is it could be worse now scrubs tend to when they see a massive force pile first make some stupid comment because in clints words "it seems they’ll never get out of the hole they’re in" and he’s right i played against a scrub who played about 30 it could be worses i grabed it but he’d either it could be worse the drain or cancel it with a y-wing piece of S*it and then drop it to coruscant i couldn’t get my alters out so that prompted adding this

And now how to play vs. Different decks

Hidden Base X
your best hope is to get dengar in PO to a pile up w/ bossk and fett and a scrub or 2 on the bus to soak up the attrition they give you.  now you get 2 destinies w/ about 10 added with 2 fours you’ve got 18 in attrition so you take out 5 x-wings pretty good

RST in trouble here no esta you just beat their scrub scouts into submission and make your drains in space to quick for their slow as*es to catch up and blow the pitiful bunker stop that at all cost or else there goes the obj and 8 force

Profit Beats Beats and more Beats w/ 3 vaders you should just assault them w/ beat after beat and space drains eating them away try your best to prevent han from getting rescued but in most game’s its inevitable

MWYHL ok in our area players w/ this play on the edge and track a 7 destiny to it to retrieve a ton although with a thought to be dead isb big blue deck i killed it by 18 he cause no damage i had one card in my lost pile...the starting interrupt this one was even centered around adding insane amounts of destinies and mains & toys beats

TIGIH this is where trouble begins your landing platform is converted and LSJK is a loose gun until you pick him up this is where your only option is to hold off beats until you can’t anymore and once you can deny them the opportunity to kill you off by turning vader if they aren;t in space but if you should be playing a super falcon deck as a meta change i would add a few more admirals (ozzel sounds good) and a few more imp commands to lower the amounts of huge destiny;s they draw with punch it/out of nowhere combo especially on the super falcon mk. 2 (GS1 Gen Lando (or afro lando) and Nien Numb (or tall for a sullustan) since they already get 2 destiny and some pretty hot immunity to crack

Ok thank you for the reviews i’ve got a tourney tommorow so i will hope for the best and thanks again  '
