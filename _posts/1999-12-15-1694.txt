Strategy: 

This is a fun deck I whipped up out of boredom.  The thought of Bubo and some Womp rats eliminating the Jedi, and thus allowing the Empire to dominate the Universe just struck me as funny.  Start with Crush the Rebellion unless you have a good reason not too.  Here's the basic strategy:

vs. Ops -  Drop creatures to pester them.  Follow with beat down if possible.  Convert their Swamp if you draw yours.  Counter Assault as needed.  Fun.

vs. Revo/Nudj -  Well, you pretty much have all of your bases covered here.  Eat the nudjes, Evader the Revos.	Eat or battle their carachters. Visage will take its toll.

vs. Tosche Mains - Hope you draw your Krayt Dragon in your opening hand :)

vs. MWYHL - Visgage + Search and Destroy make them depoly somewhere other than Dagobah.  If they for some reason leave the apprentice upside down alone.... ok probably not going to happen ;)

vs. Hidden Base - This will not be fun, but it is still possible to win.  Twi'lek for Search and Destroy.  Sense Transmission Terminated.  Track destinies for Counter Assault.  Convert Coruscant if you can.

There's just way too many fun DS decks out there.  If I could only think of something for the LS....
