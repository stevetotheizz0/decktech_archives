Strategy: '

DPC Atlanta made me change my deck a little bit. Since it was my first tourney, I learned a lot.
Basically, I took out one Slight Weapons Malfunction, Leia of Alderaan, Incom Engineer, and the Bantha Droid. I added another All Wings Report In (Retrieval/Pull X-Wings to save Organized Attacks for battle), Star Destroyer (High destiny, used interrupt that helps since many decks have at least one SD in), Out of Nowhere (I have more X-Wings than Enhanced characters), and Ice Storm (Really would’ve helped with Mara/Vader/Maul draining on the 4th Marker for 2+).

For a complete setup, check out my first version. This is the simplified one
Beginning  - Pull and play EBG, Echo War Room first with ANSB. Echo Corridor and EBO second. Echo DB third and play EBO. If you have any of those five cards in your drawing hand, EBO’s out on turn two. Throw Hobbie/Zev/Wedge on Echo sites and an X-Wing at the DB to complete it.

Middle - Haven on Hoth for pure evilness. Incom Corp for better X-Wings. Rebel Fleet to stop a drain. Beat down with X-Wings and Enhanced folk (Han, Obi, Lando, Chewie).

End - Drain them to death or beat them down with the immune to attrition X-Wings (Organized Attack).

How it fared against
CCT/MFD Well, I rescued Han. Beat down Aurra Sing and Boba w/Blaster (Holding Jabba’s Prize) with my Lando, Chewie, and Dash (adds destiny with Lando). Drained him in space to death and on CC with those guys.

Black Sun The guy never moved Xizor, I didn’t deploy Luke until late in the game. Drained to death.

MKOS Got the crap beaten out of me (-28) he had Galid with Mara in Jabba’s Palace draining like mad. More than me even. Threw down Executor, Chimaera, and Thrawn in one turn. But, I did enough damage (Organized Attack, Out of Nowhere, Haven, EBO, and Leaders on Hoth) that I killed his Executor

Speeder Bikes He drained on ground, I drained in space. Close loss.

SYCFA Got EBO up and running before he got to Alderaan. Drained faster than he could. Also, Hoth sites take away from CPI. Drain and space beatdown.

That Thing’s Operational Forgot that ties don’t move and didn’t know that DS2 can’t blow up planets so never deployed Hoth. Should have and moved my X-Wings for drains. Major loss (-30).

That about wraps it up. Check out the first version for some other tips.
