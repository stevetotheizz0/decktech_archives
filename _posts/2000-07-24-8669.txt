Strategy: 

(Correction: You Cannot Hide Forever should be replaced with Imperial Decree)

This deck may not seem like much, but it has the potential to cause lots of damage early on before the opponent has Honor of the Jedi in effect.  To begin, play Prepared Defenses to deploy Imperial Arrest Order, Mobilization Points, and Crush The Rebellion.  On the first turn, if the opponent gave you two force, deploy the Death Star: Docking Bay 327 from your Reserve Deck, take an I Have You Now into hand, and deploy Vader to the Docking Bay for a quick flip and lots of activation on your second turn.  If the opponent gave you less than two force (or if he started with Goo Nee Tay), grab the Executor: Docking Bay and wait until your second turn to deploy Vader.	With the threat of Put All Sections On Alert and I Have You Now, you can pretty much assure that Vader will be safe sitting at the Docking Bay.  Another advantage you receive from utilizing the Death Star: Docking Bay 327 is its immunity to the popular Projection Of A Skywalker.  If the opponent drops Luke at any battleground, stack some destinies with Reactor Terminal and send Mara down (with 4-LOM if necessary) to defeat him in a duel.
