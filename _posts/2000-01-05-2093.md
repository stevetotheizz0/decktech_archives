Strategy: '

I stole this strategy from Martin Faulke, so I owe him a lot of thanks.  If you havent seen his deck, go check it out, its called 'Why martin Faulke is number 4 in the world'...

Anyways, this deck is played almost exactly like that.	Cloud City sites are for draining if they give you no better alternative.  Take control of Tibrin early.  Track around your systems then flip HB late game.  If you cant draw your Our Most Desperate Hour, ditch 3 cards and get The Signal from your deck and play it.  If you dont find it, Tunnel Vision for it.  If you still dont find it, look through your hand and on the table.  If you still dont see it, you didnt put it in or youre the most unlucky person on earth.  Usually i start Wise Advice.  This deck si good, just play with it a while. '
