Strategy: '

-update-
if you fear hunt down, add curage o.a.s. with four tunnel visions you should be able to get  this card and jedi luke, and he is quite hard to cross over. play carefully and dont deploy ben/luke until you feel that they are secure. also, if they deploy vader somewhere on tatooine, you can keep running from him (unless he has got walkers). the locations should be deployed as follows tatooine docking bay - farm - <>street - <>docking bay. so if he deploys vader to the farm, deploy luke/ben to <>docking bay and when he starts to move towards you, use dockingbay transit to get to the other docking bay.

-<>-

More or less same strategy as the other deck. Deploy your ships cheep with squadron assignments to the <>docking bay (falcon is even deploy -2), then move them for free to the system. you will have plenty of activation thanks to staging areas. set up celebration and start retrieve.

Same here with ill take the leader your shipps are immune, your drains at the 2 docking bays are each +1, and you can relocate that YT-class freighter to any docking bay for battle damage, and then get it back to the system for free. since you will gain power at tatooine by controling the system, a lone ability 4 character will do very good on his own, but try to have ben and some other kid at one docking bay, and luke and pals at the other. If they wanna pick a fight, you have some suprise interrupts for them. tracking is pretty simple if you get celebration going. a fun deck to play, and not that hard to play it either.

(also, remember that opponents spies have a hard time to deploy to tatooine if blount and cracken are at the system)
