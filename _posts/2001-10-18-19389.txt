Old Stuff

Ben Him, his blade, his Journal, Yodas Stick, Proficiency, Meditation, and maybe some back-up. Thats one site held.
Daughter Give Leia the Ubese armor and her E-11 at an exterior site. One extra Force activated. Free insta-kill in battle.
Janse Him and his A280 alone at a site between Ben and Daughter, thats another hit at both sites.
Panaka Arm him with his +2 weapon and make him a walkeing power seven, direct damage dealing back-up for Padme.
Padme Gets out Ben. Find the Eopie for Her Highness to ride, get the Captain of Her guard with her and youve got two battle destiny.
Binks Klutzs Dance of Death. (Deploy, battle, target, lose, grab, drop to Objective to cancel drain/destiny, repeat.)
Lando Exclusion of an opponents character and a stand alone battle destiny.
Arleil Use to get out a generic Gungan. Leave him and a Gungan at the Marketplace for one Force retrieved per turn, one battle destiny, and one power destiny when No Love For The Empire is up.


New Stuff

Junkin and a Grenade Ive been playing the Detonator for the Dark Side a lot recently so I figured Id try the Light Sides room kiler. It actually works pretty well, especially on Junkin. Pull a two or a zero, use Junkins text to modify it and BOOM Youve just wiped out Vader, Maul, Aurra, Mara, and several of the Dark Sides other heavy hitters, like IG-88, 4-LOM, and Boba Fett
Star Destroyer and Artoo-Detoo in Red 5 Destiny sevens. What more can you say?
Do Or Do Not & WIse Advice Ive found that this deck can get stung from SAC, so I added some protection.
Mindful Of The Future This deck has a little trouble grabbing Marketplace and Tatooine without it.


Anti-R3

Lightsaber Combat Worried about Maul or Vader trying to fight your Jedi? Draw a zero, one, or two and theyre hsitory. Explosives are such wonderful things.
Maintanence Say Dark Side has out the new Super Fett. Win the Race, drop I Did It on table and give the Dark Side problems with keeping Force where they need it.
Aurras Rifle This could be trouble for your Jedi. But, lo Blaster Deflection, Bens Journal, and Too Close For Comfort come into play to protect your mediators.
