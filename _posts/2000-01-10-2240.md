Strategy: '

There are so many ways to play this objective, but I opted for the direct approach Concentrate on Tatooine, and make the LS come to you.
Obviously, the objective allows you to travel the space line via docking bays, but I opted to only include Yavin IV and Hoth for Imperial Decree.  That way, if LS decides to ignore you, you can at least cancel their drain bonuses.
Gailid and particularly Mosep are included to really make the LS feel the pain if they stay away from Tatooine.  There is nothing worse than being forced to lose force from the force pile.  I did not include Expand the Empire because I lack SAC protection, but it also deserves consideration.
Scum and Villany really makes this deck hum, and should allow you to set up quickly on the ground.  Mara is the perfect compliment to this strategy, and gives the deck a big gun.  Despite this, I added 2 Vaders 'just in case'.  I suppose old habits die hard

Once the LS decides to engage you on Tatooine, let the games begin  All Wrapped Up is the usual start for this deck, though Imperial Decree (for Operatives) and Security Precautions (for HB) can also be used.  In addition to AWU, the deck has multiple ways to capture LS characters.
Bountys allow for some cheap force regeneration, and of course the Rancor and Trap Door allow you to neatly (and painfully for the LS) dispose of your prisoners.  Of course, the Sarlacc is the other option, and could be easily incorporated with the addition of 2 Skiffs (to protect your aliens from the creature attack).
The Sarlacc is worthy of consideration, but I opted for the Rancor and Trap Door (2 recycling 5's are always a plus)

One thing I've struggled with is the choice of ships for this deck.  Obviously, the Bus and Boba in Slave I are the natural choices; however, since Bossk and Boba are also needed on the ground, what is the DS to do?
To address this problem, I have added 3 ORS and Jabba's Space Cruiser.  The ORS are nice because they get the S&V bonus and can draw destiny on independent starships.  To this end, I may eventually replace some of my other ships with 'EMPTY' bounty hunter ships for the added flexibility they offer.
Thoughts, comments, and criticisms of this approach are welcomed.
