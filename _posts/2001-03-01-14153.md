Strategy: '

Vs. RalOps start Ounee Ta instead of Staging Areas.  Take over their planet.  Game over.


Vs. Court start Aim High ahead of Squassin.  Being able to pull Zuckuss/Bossk in ships means they will hurt you in space, so wait a while and just pick up/tunnel vision to get ships and pilots.  Then beatdown when you’ve got enough ability.


Vs. everything else

Pull your docking bay.  Go for the first turn flip if you can.  Most of the time you’ll get cheap enough guys in your opening hand.  Put at least one at each docking bay, or if you’ve got Blast the Door, to the cantina.  Feel free to put Dash in ship out to the system, just remember to deploy them to the <>db (the ship is free there, and taking off is free).  Lose your interrupts to early force drains.  Back up your guys second turn and pick up for future beatdown characters and retrieval.  Don’t deploy the farm until you want to Harvest.  Harvest back characters, Harvests, OOCs, and Insertion Plannings.  You want the other interrupts in the lost pile.  Save the On the Edge until you lose something you can’t live without (both farms, both Owen/Berus, the Outrider) or until late game.  There are four 6s and several 5s to track.  Harvesting back 6s is a very easy way of ensuring a good On the Edge.  Blast the door, kid is a god card.  Most DS beatdowns come from high ability guys, so it usually ends the battle.  It always ends the battle when your only character(s) are ability >2.  If your opponent sees it in the lost pile, it can greatly change his strategy.  OOC/TT wrecks Hunt Down. '
