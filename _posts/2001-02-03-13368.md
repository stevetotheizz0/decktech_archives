 Dr. E is supposed to be Dr. E & Ponda Baba 

Refer to Prodigy for a better understanding of how the deck works.


Reflection 2 makes this deck so much more effecient with the combo cards and the new kick @#$% aliens and droids. The deck got a lot tougher on the ground while still maintaining the flexibility of the Brangus engine and retrieval. One of the most flexible decks around- can beat EBO/Xwings by fighting in space (add in Virago if you are still scared) One game I think I deployed Bossk in Hounds Tooth on 3 consecutive turns while retrieving 2 every turn on top of that.


Card analysis seperate of original Prodigy of note


JP Lower Corridor is for superior force generation (13 for you by 3rd turn) and a great interior drain site away from Speeders and Patrol Craft. Always put the LC opposite of TJP- make the light side try to cross through the AC beatings.


Xizor is the man. Combo with Set for Stun to stomp on some smugglers.


Dengar in Punishing One is for XWings and sometimes the Falcon. Dengar and Bossk can easily take out 3 of 6 XWings in a battle. Always lose Dengar to attrition and retrieve back into hand using Brangus.


Ghhhk & TRWEU is too good. Stops run away ships and arconas. Always a must retrieve card using Brangus. Combined with Blast Door Controls, severely limits light side evasion capabilities. Almost forgot, it stops the Tantive which is the Zuckuss-killah.


Defensive Fire & Hutt Smooch is pretty much for the Smooch. Nothing more annoying than Boush chilling at the AC.



If you are playing this deck for the first time, make sure you read the original Prodigy notes *thoroughly* or you will get your teeth kicked in. Good luck.
