Strategy: 

this deck is the sh1t don’t be surprise if all the Québec crew play this deck at con this summer
the walker garison is there to grab a walker you don’t play it for drain, since i only have 2 exterior hoth site.
take control of everything and kick him in the nuts

you dont have too worry about WYS, i know it suck to activate less but you can still kick him hard in the nuts
this deck is cool because the meta is now unknow with tatooine out and with this deck you can kick the meta in the nuts since it can take anything out.
this deck is tight and deliver savage beating....the tittle of the deck should be ”Why i kick your mom in the nuts” i know moms dont have nuts but your mom have a huge pair
