***Change in Mobilization Points in for Resistance***

This is just a deck I use for playing with friends when we play by ourselves.

First of all, I take Gall into hand using MOBPoints and I deploy it.  I place YCHF out of play to get perimator patrol and deploy that.  I get out my SD's and Ominous out as soon as possible.  The point of this deck is not try and flip your objective right away, it's getting out OMinous and draining the opponent to death.  I flip only when the oppotunity comes up.  The vehicles are to hold endor with Dyer, while vader, mara, and tarkin go beating.  The BH's are a little suprise, most people don't expect them in an endor deck and they can pack quite a punch.  You can also put them on the Destroyers.  I get good activation with this deck, so the deploy of the SD's are not a problem, and when I get it going, I can drain for almost 20.  What some people overlook is the ground drains.  The deck is built around drains in space, but usually, you can get an easy 4-5 on the ground with no resistance.  Bad feeling Have I is to slow down EPP deployment even more, and the AT-AT's are focal points on the ground if you can get them out.  If you can't, don't worry, just lose them to drains.

All in all, it works pretty well, at least it can beat my friends...  ;-)
