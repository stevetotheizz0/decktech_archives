Strategy: '

I have played with this deck for a while and it always wins.I saw a  deck somewhat like this in Decktech; earlier in the year. The first thing you see with this deck is the minimal space support. You don't really need a whole lot of space with this deck, Really what can the dark side do in space. This deck will usually win a drain race, just because of the flip side of the objective. Secondly all the interrupts in this deck, you really are prepared for alot. The narrow escape + Order to engage combo can be deadly. I am thinking about adding some "Lost in the wilderness" I was at a tourney recently and saw how potent this card can be.

Obviously every region plays different cards, so I am not going to break this down into a vs strategy (eg vs Ralops, vs Court).
Just try this deck for yourself, it is a very strong deck. I may make a 2.o ver with some more changes.

I'll give you an idea of this decks power. I just beat a Ralops deck last week, by 39. I flipped my objective ASAP, and started draining and letting the objective do it's thing.
He decides he can't take it anymore, and deploys Vaderw/saber&Tarkin&Mara w/saber to the Aud chamber. I have Ben w/saber & boush &Han. I play "double agent"  and take out Mara. He iniates a battle, I "run,luke,run" Master luke w/saber to the battle.
I "clash Of Sabers" Tarkin. He Swings first I play "Swing and a Miss". I then go on to play 1)skywalkers 2)Don't get cocky 3)Gift of the mentor 4)Courage of a skywalker  5)Smoke screen. -- and that was the end of that game. I won by 39, we played again - this time he was a bit smarter, and I won by 18.
My point is, this deck has the read cards to help you lay a beating; and with the force generation - You will always get the cards you need.'
