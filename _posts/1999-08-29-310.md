Strategy: '

Addendum I'm not sure if I typed Ability Ability
Ability in but if it isn't on the list then
take out a pilot. I'm also trying to fit in an
Imperial Decree.
Not your typical Mike Fitzgerald deck ;) You must
be thinking what the heck is that ? Well this
deck is incredibly strong. SAC doesn't do jack.
There is like 3 cards that are immune here ,Sense
could only mess with reacts and chances are if
they are using a good amount of senses then
they'll be grouped together and you won't need to
react. You can hold your own toe to toe with any
deck. You'll particularly notice that EPPs are
pretty helpless versus this deck. Keep your pilots
on the Walkers and IAO up and you can push them
around at will. Battle Order is HUGE in this deck.
Set up a solid force at both ground and space and
while they are scrambling around trying to set up
drains while paying you will be able to get card
advantage on them by draining for free and dumping
guys and sites followed by guys and sites. Ability
Ability Ability is a major game breaker.

v. Ops- Start Battle Plan. You can mess around on
their planet , try to set up ABC2theUni ASAP. Set
up a few drains on the side and protect ABC. You
can harass them like crazy and it'll be an
excellent game.

v. MWYHL- Broken Concentration start will hurt
them and you can set up Walkers and pilots. Like
I said , ' Suprise Assault what ? ' . Secret Plans
and CBHYBC should be able to bring them out and
you can punish them when they do.

v. Mains and Toys- Spread out, Imperial Arrest
Order will do most of the work here. Battle Plan
kinda forces the EPPS to chose Space or ground
and with them out of one of the theatres you'll
be fine.

v. Yavin 4 w/ or w/o Revo- Death Star w/ Sec Pre
or IAOrder will make them play pretty careful.
Basically like Mains and Toys.

v. Hidden Base- Death Star , Security Pre , Battle
Plan will usually slow down HBase. Grapple
Organized Attack and YOU WILL BE ABLE TO OUTLAST
AN X-WING SWARM )

v. anything else- I dunno I think that is all
you'll probably see. Its about a simple as a deck
as you can build.

Miscellaneous Notes Don't underestimate the power
to look through your reserve. You can use the
Lambda shuttle to go get V's Shuttle and M'kae
to search for something. Lennox and Secret Plans
look for stuff too. Also , once you get First Strike
rolling in this deck it is gonna be a long ride
for the Rebels.'
