Strategy: 

******* update 1 ******* i dont knew that Projective Telepathy is errated! *g*

******* update 2 ******* thx all for da reviews but hidden wepaons sucks a dest of 2??? i just want to battle once with the fettand then beta down!AND I DON’T PLAY ”Projective Telepathy I’VE JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THE IDEA SINCE SOME GUYS TOLD ME IT WAS ERRATED SO PLZ NO REVIEWS FOR ”Projective Telepathy 1


this deck got the 3rd place at the ralltir regional this year in germany.

the strat is very easy to understand, give direct damage aka force drains (but this time direct from the reserve deck).
i prefer to start with power of the hutt (a biest effect), so i got out all the important aliens to protect my chamber
like ephant mon and boelo, with the audience chamber i pull out Mosep or Gailid this is just a Tech Team i prefer to deploy mosep
from reserve deck and to pick up gailid (then he deploys for free) jabba is also a alternative alien, but this deck is fast
and gailid with mosep makes it faster. i pull out some locations like holotable (with masterful move) the bridge (with we must accelerate 
our plans) and jabbas palace i try to pick (maybe play Neimoidian Advisor to get out jabbas palace and so the lower passages)
now im gonna activate 14 force from my, and maybe 4 from the opponent so 18 force will be more then enough for my cheap sweet
bounty hunters. the race is just to give more direct damage and to retrieve a little bit, but the main fact are the battles with =

scum (tech) + first strike (houjix killer or help me obi ... or run luke ...) + jabbas through with you (damn a dest of 5 for such a 
biest interrupt, hmm it used?cool) + colo claw fish (for the real beat down) + Blast Door Controls (kick all da barriers and escapes*g*)

nobody will stop the battle with this combo just one dengar with gun and new ref 3 boba will kick asses, you gonna draw 4
dests shoot 2 times and give direct damage i forgot you gonna retrieve 3 force make you opponent lose force and for less then
10 force! so what? 

the most important fact is to hide your power, dont pull out colo claw fish before you gonna beat down or battle!
you ask why? today there are many Colo Claw Fish Cancler out their, because this card is tech, so wait with Blast Door Controls
and Colo Claw Fish till you battle, also take care for aim high deploy not too much characters just 1 bounty hunter and 
one normal character (like onda baba & dr.evazan or jade), if you care this few points you will kick ben,luke etc.....

against republic characters its hard i knew, but i think ghhk, barrier and boelo with mon and jabba in the hall with protect
you from a beatdown.the main fact is also that you dont concentrate your power to the opponent why? you will retrieve 6 force with the race
give draisn with mosep and gailid.and your objective will also give some damage!

maybe pull in guri with ship or some other b. ship cause HBX will make it hard but i think it isnt very hard to probe the base,
just go out with zuckuss in space and protect his a.ss from x-cannons.bossk in ship is a capital so he will be alive with a passanger like
ponda baba & dr.evazan, just try it.

and now one totaly new idea !!!


==============================================================================================================================================================
*************************************************** read this amazing idea (thx alex for the genial style) ***************************************************
==============================================================================================================================================================

if you want to retrieve the 3 force with scum + first strike witout a battle damage look thru this idea.

example :

you have 12 force open so deploy boba fett (not ref 3) for 4, deploy dengar for 4 now you have 4 force open,battle pay 3 force for the force
retrieval so no you have got no more force, and at this point you play a just action the tech interrupt Projective Telepathy

... OR A PLAYER who just initiated a battle or force drain must use 2 force or it is cancled.

hmm no force for you and the battle is canceld, its nice or?? next turn youll have enough things to proetct your a.ss like
ghhk or jabbas through with you,just try it and tell me if it still works???

so this was my deck that i played at the raltiir regionals 2002, and i got the 3rd place and qualified my a.ss for the 
world champions*g* cause b.winkelhaus won the tournament and so the 2nd and 3rd place goes also, its really nice for me!
(check my tour. report called Mainz  19.05.2002 Regional Raltiir Tournament-Germany-Switzerland-Austria)


thx all for reading and rating this deck, and plz tell me your awesome ideas!
