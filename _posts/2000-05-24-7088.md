UPDATE
I'm thinking now that I might be better off with Dengar in Punishing 0ne instead of IG-88.  I think the deck could do with the extra punch against Hidden Base, while the trouble I see with Iggy is that if he gets Barriered, then he's more of a hinderance than a help (he'll ruin the numbers).
END UPDATE

This is a revised version of my Deal With This Deck.   IG-88 has been added for suicide extra suicide beatdown potential.  Tallon Roll has also been added because it is vicious with the Obsidian TIEs.  The unique troopers have been altered slightly (the biker scouts add some pilot ability), but they are all still effectively 2/2 troopers.  I don't have a second Occupation, so please don't tell me to add another.

Start with the West Gallery, Secret Plans and Arrest Order.  Use Battle Order instead of Arrest Order against Ops.

This deck is very versatile.  Not only is there Dark Deal and Occupation to do damage, but a lethal numbers element and Ability, Ability, Ability to cause late-game damage.

The first few turns are usually the same.  Pull out the Docking Bay with Arrest Order and pull the stuff from the Objective.  If the LS gets a big group of mains together on Cloud City, then leave them alone.  Get Occupation and the inserts going.  Remember the if you control Raithal, then the troopers are all destiny 5.  Don't risk losing control of Bespin just to control Raithal, though.  Destiny 3 or 4 troopers will do plenty of numbers damage anyway.

If a few LS characters try to stop your drains, then obviously beat the crap out of them.  This is perhaps the best feature of this deck- the ability to switch from defensive to offensive very quickly.

Card choices
The locations (except the d/bay) are deliberately all interior.  This means that Stunning Leader can be used at all of them, and Speeders can only get to the docking bay (but you don't start Arrest Order against Ops anyway, so who cares?)

I've used a mix of troopers, chiefly to avoid Grimtaash damage.  The non-uniques are for using with Strategic Reserves.  I didn't use Cloud City troopers because they stop you going off of Cloud City, and Navy Troopers are pretty much as good anyway (power 3 on the defensive and good against Ops).  The unique troopers provide much-needed extra ability.  They are all basically 2/2.  The most important feature of all the troopers is that they are destiny 3 (4 or 5 with Raithal out). Vader and Iggy are for suicide beatdowns (or non-suicide when the numbers run out).  4-LOM isn't great in this deck as he needs assistance to battle (this deck is not about applying beatings).

The other cards should seem straightforward.  Boring Conversation stops the dreaded Surprise Assault.  Ability, Ability, Ability is devastating against mains decks, especially Jedi Testing ones (no need for Failure At The Cave).  Use it once a few mains are out and the LS will be hard pressed to keep deploying people.  The other function of this card is to force the LS to keep activating, so helping the numbers pop up.	Finally, I've haven't used Dengar in Punishing One.  This is because I preferred the cheap deploy of Obsidian 7, making the deck work more quickly.

In summary, concentrate on the aspect of the deck most likely to harm the opponent.  Don't charge into space against Hidden Base decks (use the inserts).  There are a lot of elements for the LS to deal with here.
