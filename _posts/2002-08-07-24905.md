Updates-

Thx for all the good reviews guys. Kev, you had me worried, but force lightning does target defence value... perhaps you are thinking of DVDLOTs choke. BlackViper, I agree that another oh, switch off would be nice, but Im not sure what to take out, and most people dont consiter my droids the juiciest targets for weapons. I disagree that another Xizor is neccesary, hes destiny 1 and I protect him well... and yes, flipped objective + bossk w/ gun IS mad tech.  >D

For those of you who have no Idea who 3B3 is (that should be most of you), he is a droid from theed palace who says blah blah blah.... once per turn, you may use 1 force to make an opponents character defence value -3 for remainder of turn, when combined with Weapons and force lightning (used or lost, but usually lost), thats one spicy meat-a-ball This deck also has a force choke theme going on. I start off giving up no Icons, and I use Bad Feeling and Broken Consentration, but I usually pull Carida and/or blockade flagship DB, so Im not doing hard-core force chokin. Anyways, its kinda hard to write a strat for this deck, cause its so interactive with your opponent, you just gotta deal with the characters as your opponent plays them. kill Luke Asap, and only bring Xizor out if you can protect him (preferably with guri). Once Fliped, check out the top of your deck and battle accordingly, check out your force pile and draw accordingly. I love this objective.


Matchups-

WYS - Hope you draw Emperor Early, stick him at Cantina and wait.. if your opponent comes down for a beating, divide and conquer; barrier someone, buzz someone, dark strike someone, whatever you can do. you might end up having to lose palpy, but thats ok, theres 5 in the deck. Have zuckuss do some work in space, but be careful not to get beatdown, It would be nice to throw a vigo or 4-lom up their as a 2nd pilot. Youve also got 2 Theyre still coming through to mess with their Fallen Portals and barriers. Just play it smart, you should win.


QMC - Should be a semi-difficult match-up. You’ll probly have to go to them, since they would out-drain/retrieve you if it came to that. Save some sense for the inevidible Path of least resistance, screwing one of those up could be game. Take out as much of their ground forces as possible, and don’t attack in space unless you think they’re getting sloppy (Like only puting 1 dude at bespin to flip). Deny them force as much as possible (don’t pull your 2nd docking bay, or maybe even carida), and get Broken Concentration/ Bad Feeling Asap.


LSC - You have some options here, choose carfully. 1 thing you can do is beatdown, evader (lost) to check out their hand and see what battle evasion they have, and dertermine if you have enough to stop them (sense, still coming through, ect.). the other way to go about it is track some 6’s and drop palpy, which can be harder than it sounds since you must get the 6’s set up and drop him before they drop anyone (cause of palpy’s chicken-Sht text). Also, the force denial can really hurt them since they might only play they’re starting 2 sites.


Enjoy,

John Irving
