Strategy: '

Start w/ Mos Eisley

vs. ops  start insurrection, build & send over a beatdown crew

vs. HDADTJ Either use Transmission Terminated or an undercover spy on Visage.	Then put H'nemthe with Luke and/or Obi-Wan along with some attrition fodder so Vader is deploy +2.  If anyone has a Goo Nee Tay, I need one

vs. just about anything else overpower people and kill them

I think that A Gift is good to have, since most of my area's decks are mostly alien, as far as I know.
Wioslea is interesting, as she has a destiny 5 and can 'buy' EJP 4-LOM =)
Double Agent is for getting rid of those undercover spies
Arc Welder can free captives and exclude characters from battles
Loje Nella is good vs. JP decks
Harc Seff helps when you put him between two major opponent's force drain sites
CZ-3 is good for reacts and is backup for A Gift
Meditation +3 weapon destinies and an extra battle destiny? need I say more?

This is my first major attempt at being a defensive deck, with lots of cards to counter others.  Please be suggestive, unless you give me 5 stars.
I don't have any ECC or EJP cards yet, but if you think its a really good idea, say it.
Thanx '
