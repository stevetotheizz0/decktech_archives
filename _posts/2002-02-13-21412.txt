Strategy:

This deck sets up very well. You start off with 6 force by yourself (Not including the LS player). 
First Get Carida with Mob points. Pod race! Then depending on hand lose combo to pull effect. I.e.: IAO.
Use IAO to get out DB’s. (Enough Force Activation?) I Use TIE defenders due to HYPERSPEED but TIE Interceptors also work Fine. Everything eles is just power and high forfeit-low deploy Characters.
IMPERIAL DECREE works well against any force Drain Booster decks.
Sonic Bombardment to get out CC: SEC TOWER. (Or take out for Zuckuss in ship and short range fighters/WYB)

Against Sandcrabs: Deploy Vehicles and Starships wisely. Play Right Aand you win!

LS Combat: Battle The Jedi out in Theed. Most of these decks do’t use starships no force drain problems. (Battle plan DShield works well here + Imperial Decree)

QMC: Dominate space, don’t let’m flip!

Rebel Strike Team: Just Play Wisely you’ll win (maybe switch Zuckuss for Conduct your search) 

TIGIH/ICSH: Don’t lose battles. Let Vader Take Luke. It keeps him off the board.
