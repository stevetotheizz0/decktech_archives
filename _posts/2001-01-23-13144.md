Strategy: '

	I made this deck because I was SICK of losing to Court with my HB mains deck. But what I have now found out is that this deck is not only capable of beating Court, but of beating almost any deck.THERE IS A LOT OF TECH IN THIS DECK SO PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE STRATEGY BEFORE REVIEWING.

   Basicly what you do is set up Tessek & Rennek (If against Scum to stop Bubo) up at the AC with Bo Shuda out (pull with AC). Now you start with a desert and you have 4 others. Now use aliens piloting the speeders to drain for two at each desert site (3 if you play T-47 Battle Formation).
  The Big tech comes with CZ-3. With CZ-3 you may react to any battle or force drain at same or adjacent site by deploying cards at normal use of the force to the location. Now what you do is place CZ-3 in a speeder at one of your deserts (if you have 3 deserts out place him in the middle desert so his gametext applies to the other 2 deserts) so that if your opponent innitates a battle at either Cz-3*s site or one of the other two, you can react by deploying a sandwhirl.  When you do this all your opponent*s characters out of a vehicle are then missing and the battle stops.


Now here are the answers to some of the problems I know you are thinking

<< What if they play control on the sandwhirl?
Well you do have four, so the chance of you having another to play is very good. If not then cancel the battle with It*s a Trap or play Houjix (if you get crushed). I have 3 It*s a Trap and I always save 3 force for it (must save 4 if they are using first strike) so normally I have one. Also Control is rarely used these days

<
This is what I have 2 Mechanical Failures for. Just deploy them as a react with CZ-3 and make the Walker power & forfeit 0. Now most Imperial decks play with Blizzard 2 & Tempest 1 which is only two walkers that can*t do much damage. If they do sneak one down and you don*t have a Mechanical Failure in your hand then either use It*s a trap or just forfeit your speeder and alien (With just one or two walkers down they won*t have too much power).


<< What if they play Imperial Decree and cancel your force drain bonus?
Well that really sucks. Not much you can do about that. Fortunately today*s meta decks do not use this card (if they did this deck wouldn*t be worth playing with)

<< What if you play a deck with lots of walkers and scout walkers?
There are NO decks like this where I play, but if there are in your area then add Maneuvering Flaps and maybe Attack Pattern Delta. Combine these cards with Mechanical Failure and they are toast. 

<
There aren*t many decks that use this card at the moment and my speeders/aliens are immune b/c of Yarna. I also normally only keep one Sanwhirl and one It*s a Trap in my hand at one time using Traffic Control, so they won*t get much. Also against COURT I always hold two It*s a Trap in my hand. But NO COURT decks use Monnok, there just isn’t room.

<
Well normally any deck that uses this card is not a draining deck. So take a few extra turns (where you aren*t draining) to get totally set up and then just start draining. The cards in this deck deploy so cheap that you don*t need much force. Also this is not a beat down deck so all you have to leave force for is It*s a Trap. Otherwise you can just use your force to drain. Most of the time you will get force from your opponent as well. Really not a problem

<
Well I have start TINT and WA while playing with 2 Controls. Really no problem since I have mutiple copies of key cards. The Controls are also nice for canceling your own Sandwhirl so that you can be set to whip out another.

The meta decks of today are all battle decks not drain machines. I guarenty that you will win almost EVERY game you play against reactive decks (they react to what you do with battles). As you can see I stop their guys with sandwhirl and I stop their walkers with Mechanical Failure so they are screwed.

So once you get set up (takes 2-3 turns normally) you can just drain away. Any smart player will see that all I play is deserts and not deploy there which leaves me with some big drains. One nice thing is I give away NO locations that are not deserts that they can drain on (AC has Bo Shuda). So they*ll have to get their own and start draining. But, as you will find, their drains are tiny compared to yours. If they are dumb and deploy just sandwhirl them and that*s gameover.

Since I took so long to explain the deck I will keep the strategy section short.

AGAINST SCUM MKOS, Court, SYCFA, whatever; they are DEAD. These decks are total battle decks with no walkers and almost no drains. If they deploy to battle they are toast. If they try to drain at their 1-3 pitiful sites you*ll kill them. Really no way to lose to one of these.

AGAINST BHBM Also really a piece of cake. Give them EPP Luke (have him instead of Jedi Luke b/c he is cheaper and your opponent won*t win any battles anyways. Just sit back and drain. Mechanical Failure the Walkers and Sandwhirl the guys (if they are stupid enough to deploy). Really easy.

AGAINST SPACE Unless it*s Ties you will have an easy victory. Cancel a drain with Bargaining Table and drain for a ton on the ground. Against Ties it will be a little harder since they retrieve a lot. Basicly you need to spread out on every site you have and drain like heck. T-47 Battle Formation helps a lot as well as Tessek. Ties are the hardest deck to play but I am 1-0 against them so far.

AGAINST HDADTJ Visage will hurt until you get your TT. If this is popular in your area then I’d add 1-2 more TT (not necassary for me). Besides Visage it*s a piece of cake. Dueling won’t hurt at all (use Luke as a pilot if you want) and battle decks will be smoke (won*t they all -)
It’s a reactive deck....so PIECE of CAKE

AGAINST ANY OTHER GROUND DECK These ground decks are easy. Drain away and use Boushh/B.Table to cancel drains. Then just drain away and nail them with your effects if they deploy.
