Strategy: 

well, after messing around with hunter’s isb deck for a while, i thought...hey! what makes it work is that it has a huge space drain.  so i used the space drain portion of the deck...and based it on SYCFA because i really feared the ground beatdown.  2x maul and 2x lord vader for only a little ground power. undercover spies are good. agents of the black sun i threw in because i thought it would be fun to chase around the rebel fleet with zuckuss and guri.  it ended up working a bit...so i decided to keep it.  like i said, this deck is pretty gay, but it works okay.
