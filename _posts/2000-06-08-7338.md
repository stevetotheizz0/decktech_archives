Strategy: '

This is a throne room deck. It is obvious how to play people If you dont know how, look at ...beating of a lifetime...

THE THRONE ROOM SHOULD BE IN THE DECK......

use hnmenthe against ROPS.

In a few reviews they have said that this deck would have problems against HDADTJ. I havent won by less than 20 with this deck and 6 times I played it were against HDADTJ.
