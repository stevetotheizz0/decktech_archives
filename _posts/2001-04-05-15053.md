***UPDATE***

Add Secret Plans, hehe there is only 59 cards (OOPS)


Ok Firsty turn Search and put Ephant mon on the executer db. and if you have enough force put Myo Onith there too. Then you  have the game one, You put Jabba’s Prize at the Audience chamber really fast due to the fact of lift tube’s and retreive with scum. And vader is in the deck just for a suicide vader.


Once you flip the game should be  yours spread drain and Myo Onith them, when Myo Onith is at the executer Db with ephant mon they cant be touched, Due to the tightness of the game text of the DB.


And if they revo it use crush to pull Evader/Monnok out and use it also, Once you Flip Keep monnoking them Because you just retreive it with the Obj.


Have a nice day.  '
