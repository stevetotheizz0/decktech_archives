Heading for the Medical Frigate'

Strategy: '

*FORGOT MEDICAL FRIGATE ON FIRST POST*

First turn what you do depends on your hand as well as how much force opponent gives you. You start Hidden Base with Heading for the Medical Frigate and most of the time pull Wise Advise, Stkie Planning, & Squadron Assignments. No matter what before you activate go search reserve deck with Strike Planning and take Ackbar & Calrissian into your hand. Then, no matter what deploy falcon from deck with calrissian to endor. If you happen to have a good hand you can sometimes move it to Aquaris is you have it in starting hand. From then on deck is pretty simple.

**By the way darklighter spin is in there because A Few Maneuvers+Luke in Red 5 = manuever 10. Add a destiny and get rid of executer.

Against Decks

Hunt Down start Insides serve you well to go get Honor of the Jedi. Drain and battle.

Bring Him Before Me start Insides serve you well to go get Honor of the Jedi. More drain and battle.

ROPS boring game overpower Raltiir as much as possible. Strikeforce still makes it possible to drain and you canel all thier drains, most likely a timed win unless Order To Engage stays on table.

Court Get Honor of the Jedi Out and hit them with Order to Engage by deploying BoShuda with Rennek.

Dark Space Order to Engage=loss, battle and drain.
