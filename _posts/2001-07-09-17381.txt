Strategy: '

PLEASE READ STRAT BEFORE REVIEWING

Sorry about the gratuitous FOIL CRAP, I copied the deck list from Deckmaker, and didnt realize those were the DoS, Gen Solo, and Chewie that I selected.

EDIT
Remove Chewie Of Kashyyk (Deploy is simply too high)  Add Ounee Ta.
Remove Life Debt x2.  Add Dont Get @#$%y and Dodge.
Remove YISYW.  Add Mercenary Armor.

I was thinking about Strike Planning when I realized that you could be 95% certain of getting General Solo deployed whenever you need to.  This works wonders, because the Bad Feeling Beatdown card works with Han, so you can beatdown whenever you need to.  Therefore, the basic idea of this deck is to wait for your opponent to deploy to space or the ground, deploy, Frozen Assetts, Beatdown.  Game over.

CARD CHOICES

SATM & Blaster Prof--some people might cricize me for this when there arent really any cards that can hit anybody.  Dont forget though that you can also use it to add 3 to your Stun Blaster total.  That should effectively remove one character from the battle.
Stun Blaster--If you hit somebody, theyre out of the battle.  That means less power for them, and bigger damage for you.
Beezer & Portable Scanner--Madine gets Beezer.  Beezer gets the Portable Scanner.  Now, you assess where your opponent is making his stand.  Use the Scanner to get the Stun Blaster, Landing Claw, or X-Wing Cannon.  Use those devices/weapons to beatdown your opponent.
Daughter--If you know youll need to finish test 1 (Dark Deal, Walker Garrison, or ISB) Daughter completes the tests quickly.
(I received a good comment that Im considering.  Should I swap DoS for EPP Leia...what do you all think?)
Insertion Planning--Its a used 6 that reduces attrition.  With Yoda at the hut and Insertion Planning, you reduce attrition by 5.  Nobody is dying.
Landing Claw--Good for stopping space drains.  Also can detach during power segment for more battle damage.
3 Generals--You might draw a general in your opening hand.  If that is the case, you still have 2 more to draw.  If you dont draw a general in your opening hand, get Madine and Solo.  Calrissian is much less important.

And the biggest Card Choice
Mind What You Have Learned--Okay, some people might be wondering why Im playing a Jedi Testing beatdown when the WYS beatdown is so good already.  Thats a very good question.  First of all, everything started around Strike Planning, and you cant play Strike Planning with WYS (well, you could, but it wouldnt do you any good).  Secondly, people look for WYS beatdown.  It doesnt make it any less effective, but they look for it, and I want a little bit of surprise factor.  Now, most people will be wary versus any deck that starts Draw Their Fire, so it wont be too much of a surprise, but they cant not deploy.  Furthermore, both decks have their advantages and disadvantages.  WYS has to flip, and this might be its biggest weakness (albeit thats not a big weakness, when its so easy to flip WYS).  Still, you have to occupy those two battlegrounds.  In the early game, this can put you in a strategically disadvantageous situation.  With MWYHL, you dont have to worry about that.  You deploy whenever you need to.  Now, WYSs biggest advantage is the ability to play interrupts from the lost pile.  I accounted for that by playing duplicates of the important interrupts.  That way youll be sure to have one when the time for THE battle comes.  The next great advantage of WYS is its ability to completely negate Sense and Alter.  MWYHL has a similar ability.  While they can still be played.  You have to add 4 to the draw, so Vader and Maul will have to draw a 1 and Palpy will have to draw a 2.  This almost completely negates this strategy.  Especially in the current environment of high destinies because of podracing.  WYS also has 3 more advantages activation potential, force choke, and added destiny.  MWYHL has different advantages  Deployment restrictions, Character Selection, Force Drain denial, scanning your reserve deck.  All in all, MWYHL and WYS are comparable, only MWYHL has the ability to pull card faster because of Madine, Portable Scanner, Dagobah, and Strike Planning.  Thats what gives it the edge, and thats why I picked the objective.

CARDS I WOULD LIKE TO ADD

Noble Sacrifice--Just that little bit of retrieval can make all the difference.  Also works very well with Stun Blaster.
Control & Tunnel Vision--Umm, they cancel drains and search for cards.  Whats not to love...even if they are only destiny 1.
Aim High--Make them pay to retrieve, helps vs. SFS, ISB, S&V, and Podracing (especially against Podracing.)
Rebel Leadership--It works with Generals, what more do you need to know.

(If you have any suggestions of where to add these cards, please let me know.)

General Strategy

Start
MWYHL
Dagobah
HFTMF
Draw Their Fire
Strike Planning
Squadron Assignments

Zeroeth turn--pull two Generals (Calrissian is the least important).
First turn--pull Yodas Hut and Yoda, deploy them.
Second turn--pull Training Grounds, Test 1, deploy test 1 (use Great Warriors text to deploy Madine as the apprentice.)
Third turn--Test Madine (it might take him a while to get it, but he will, eventually.)  Start pulling scouts.

After theyve amassed over 10 power at one location, deploy Han, Frozen Assetts, Bad Feeling cards, Modify power, do lots of damage, you win.

Deck match-ups

Vs. Pod Racing--If they keep everybody at the podrace arena, you might have a little bit of a problem.  But, on the other hand, theyre not draining you, so its not a problem.  Youre going to lose the race (thats why Im not playing Anakins Racer).  On the other hand, its only 11 force.  In one battle, youre going to do around 30 damage.  Those numbers favor you.  And remember, Beatdown Bad Feeling is a used interrupt, so you can pull it again.  If they do spread out, which most people will, pick your battle and beat them down.
Vs. Odds--No YISYW...No Problem  This should be an easy match-up, because your opponent will only have 3 characters on the ground.  Use Madine to get our top Secret Agent Colonel Cracken.  Have him infiltrate the imperial HQ and open the door for our guys.  Jump the Emperor, Tech Mor, and Vader.  If youve planned right, when the battle is over, it should be Han, Cracken, and Beezer vs. Tech Mor with triple battle damage...Ouch
Vs. ISB Space--Train Daughter.  ISB space is somewhat slow, and it spreads out.  So there will be some strategic weaknesses.  Pick one.  Attack there.  Win that battle big, and you have nothing more to worry about.
Vs. ISB other--Train Daughter.  Again, theyre going to spread thin, so pick your spot and attack it.
Vs. Hunt Down--Madine pulls Cracken.  Cracken infiltrates the Holotheater.  If Visage is killing you, Cracken is your answer.  Youve got 2 Run, Luke Runs to cancel Vaders Obession.  Slow the damage with Honor of The Jedi.
Vs. SYCFA/SFS--Ill Take The Leader is here to kill the swarm.  Again, space decks rely on holding many systems.  Pick the weakest one and hit them there.
Vs. SYCFA/Manip--One of your tougher match-ups because theyre not looking to drain or battle, and you cant damage them on the death star.  Kill Brangus Glee.  It all revolves around Brangus Glee.  Then, launch your forces from the DB to the D* to drain for 3.  If they come after you, youve got a beatdown ready for them.  You can win this match-up if you play smart.
Vs. Ral Ops--Start Ounee Ta instead of Squadron Assignments.  You activate lots, deploy cheap, battle huge, and win big.
Vs. S&V--Hey, they deploy forces for you to beatdown, and most of them arent that hard to remove from the battle.  Awesome.  So, go and kick their butt.
Vs. Walker Garrison--Train Daughter.  Your beatdown should probably be at the Hoth system.  However, it could be on the ground.  Avoid the Ice Storms.
Vs. TDIGWATT--Train Daughter.  Dark Deal makes them Power +4, that makes this match-up harder.  But, youve also got a small contingent of TIEs at Bespin and Cloud City who dont know whats coming.
Vs. BHBM--Run, Luke Run is a non-factor.  That makes things a little bit harder, but you still have a Stun Blaster, Insertion Planning, and some other nifty tricks.
Vs. AoBS--Probably, your toughest match-up.  Why?  Because your opponent will actually be able to Sense and Alter.  So, what do you have to do.  You have to kill the Emperor.  If they dont have an Emperor, they cant Sense or Alter.  But that Emperor is just going to keep coming back.  Tough match-up, but you can win.

Anyway, Im open to any suggestions, people have.
