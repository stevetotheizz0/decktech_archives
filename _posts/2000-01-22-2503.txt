Strategy: 

Strategy is pretty simple and hasn't changed since the first monkey deck. Just get force as soon as you can. Draw up combos and deploy every effect you get. As soon as the opponent puts down a guy play every combo you have. Its very possible to end the game in one or two battles with this deck. It works most effectively against MWYHL.

Answers to reviews: I don't use the executor because if it were to be destroyed, I would lose both my executor sites (3 force for me) and my visage which hurts a lot. I might consider adding some 6/7's in the deck. Its just a matter of decided what to take out and what to put in

As for numbers, I probably should have put a resistance in. Replace Much Anger In Him with Resistance. That should help with inserts.
