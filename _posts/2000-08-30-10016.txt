Strategy: 

The main Idea Behined This deck to is to beat the snot out of your opponent. You use the Enhanced characters like Luke and Han, to defend the ground and intiate battles, the star ships to do a beat down in space and Oola to keep the opponents unique male characters in his hand. That makes it easier on you and you then have less characters to worry about and can focus on a space beat down and force draining on the ground.

PS. For this deck only start a batttle if you would have the advantage.
