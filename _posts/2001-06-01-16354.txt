I HAVE PLAYED A VERSION OF THIS DECK FOR 2 1/2 YRS SO I KNOW HOW TO PLAY DARK DEAL.   THIS DECK ALMOST ALWAYS HAS DARK DEAL OUT 2ND TURN IF NOT FOR SURE 3RD.  FIRST YOU DRAW YOUR HAND, THEN YOU USE I AM ORRY TO PULL 2 INTERIOR SITES, PULL 2 2-1 SITES. ACTIVATE THEN PULL BESPIN CLOUD CITY INTO HAND, DEPLOY THE SITES BUT NOT THE SECTOR. BY NOW YOU SHOULD HAVE A CHEAP SHIP AND 2-3 CHEAP CHARATERS, IF YOU HAVE WHAT YOU NEED THEN SAVE FORCE, IF NOT DRAW TILL YOU GET IT. NEXT TURN PULL DARK DEAL AND PREFFERABLY DROP THE GUYS AND THE SHIP, IT HAS PLENTY OF CHEAP STUFF, BUT HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A GHHHK SO YOU DONT HAVE TO CLUTTER IN , BUT I HAVE FOUND OUT IF YOU DONT HAVE A GHHHK AND LEAVEW THEM ALONE YOU MAYBE WILL HAVE TO LOSE THAT CHARATER AND BETWEEN 1 - 5 FORCE, SO YOU WILL BE DRAING FOR ALOT MORE.  NEXT TURN PULL BESPIN INTO HAND, AND BEFORE DONT FORGET  TO FORCE DRAIN .  DRAIN AND TRY TO GET A SHIP SO YOU CAN DEPLOY TO BESPIN NEXT TRUN WITH CC OCCUPATION BUT BE CAREFUL IF YOU ARE PLAYING SPACE, IF NOT FORGET ABOUT SPACE, DRAIN ON THE GROUN, FIGURE AT JUST THOSE 3 SITES YOU WILL BE DRAINING FOR 9, BY NOW YOU WILL HAVE SOME MORE SITES, I HAVE PLAYED ALL THE DIFFERENT DECKS.  THERE IS SOMETHING TO COMBAT EVERY DECK IN HERE, IF THEY WANT TO DRAIN YOU ELSEWHERE THATS WHY THE CONTROLS.  A VERSION OF THIS DECK BEFORE TATOOINE WENT 36-1, AND NOW AFTER TATOOINE ITS MUCH FASTER, BEST DECK I THINK OUT THERE '
