Responses to reviews on my earlier version

-Lando is your key to Sabacc, another has been added in place for Pucimur Tyrss, who, at most, could only add 1-2 to your drains anyways.

-3 Casinos was extreme, 1 has been dropped, and Tunnel Vision (sweet card), has had another added in.

-Because the Casino's text is retrieving, not the interrupt Cloud City Sabacc itself, Something Special Planned for them does not place Sabacc out of play.

-With The Way Of Things and such, training has gotten faster.  I usually finish test #5 around turn 7-8, the most they would have drained if I did absoltely nothing about it would be about 4-5 a turn, since their modifiers are cancelled on turn 3.  Sabacc retrieves the amount I lost (has been no more than 12 in all games I've played with it), the mains are mostly just protection for Lando, I've dropped Pucimer and the Carbonite Chamber to focus more on the Sabacc aspect, not so much on the draining.

-If I do run into a deck that manages to get Lando and Lobot out quick I have 2 good options.  First, if Lobot isnt on table, replacing Lando works good.  If Lobot is on the table, I have plenty of mains for a beatdown and plenty of toys to strike Lando and/or Lobot down with.  If Lando and Lobot made it off Cloud City or I can't reach them, I have added an extra EPP Han (a gambler), who can play Cloud City Sabacc and retrieve 2 Force a turn, which should be sufficient if they are playing on Cloud City, considering my main resources, they need 6 or more ability, I subtract 1 from their draws, can search for a card a turn by using 2, etc.

Well, this is a standard MWYHL to 6, and it utilizes mains and toys on Cloud City with Sabacc. Use basic MWYHL, use Dagobah to get out sites and the training area to get out your tests. The objective gets everything else. Daughter Of Skywalker is who you want to test, but in the case you get her in your hand with no Traffic Control you have a Son Of Skywalker ready to test, if you test DOS then Son is fine on Cloud City. Get some mains and toys and drop them on Cloud City. If you get Lando Calrissian make sure you have a main or two to guard him at the Casino so you can play Sabacc safely. I believe all MWYHL decks need some retrieval besides flipping the objective. The advantages to Sabacc are

You can use moderate destinies. With On/Off The Edge you need high destinies.

No moving around and getting picked off while making a Kessel Run or Our Most Desperate Hour.

Something Special Planned For Them cannot place Sabacc out of play, because your retrieval is coming from the Casino's text, not the interrupt itself.

With the mains and toys your Force drain potential in this deck is 13, with ontop of retrieving like mad is great. Your activation potential is 16, nice. Your Insight Serves You Well will be lost quickly 99% of the time to fetch Honor Of The Jedi. There's plenty if SA protection, from the objective itself and Wise Advice is they do happen to cancel something.

Once Leia completes Test #5 drop her somewhere if you don't expect Vader to be played, or if you do, use test #4's text to start searching for helper cards in your duel-Glancing Blow, Anakin's Lightsaber (for Glancing Blow) and Courage Of A Skywalker.

There are some cards in here you may be questioning, so here are some of those and the reasion they are in

Tunnel Vision Great card. Saved up enough Force to deploy a few mains, plus a little extra...play it and go take anything out of your Force pile. With your retrieval it may make a couple of visits.

This Is More Like It This card is sweet. They draw a 1 against your EPPs, why forfeit a chracter when you can lose that extra Casino in your hand? Tech Yoda at his Hut subtracts 2 from attrition, test #3 subtracts 1 from their destiny draws, they need a 4 to get any attrition against you. Play this and they're pretty much screwed. Sweet card.

Gold Leader In Gold 1/Landing Claw With their modifiers cancelled in space they won't be draining much. Test #4 will pull these is needed. It'll stop a drain of 2, not too bad. Satisying Battle Order is good, though you have enough activation that it isn't totally needed.

Here's how you play vs. certain popular decks

Rallops
Test pretty quickly, you should get done around turn 8. Guard Lando at the Casino with a couple mains with sticks if you can and start retrieving. If they drop Vader on Ralltiir save enough Force so you can deploy Leia, duel, and pick her up again to avoid getting creamed. With their destinies all -1, 6 or more ability needed, a 3 or 4 on Test #5, adding a battle destiny, it should be enough to stop them.

Bring Him Before Me
You have to test Leia. Get Honor Of The Jedi out to slow them down. Once they get Vader out you'll only lose 1 a turn. Deploy Luke to Cloud City. They'll most likely play a docking bay and fetch Luke or pick up Vader and re-deploy him. By the time they get Luke to the Throne Room they'll have to win battles. Keep mains tight and sabacc. They won't be able to win battles if you go really stacked. With all the tests helpers you should be able to pull off some good things.

Hunt Down
Honor Of The Jedi must get out quick. Stack on Cloud City to play Sabacc, beatdown if necessary. Have SOS armed with a saber. If they duel you want to be able to play Glancing Blow and Courage. Winning a duel against Vader would sure you a win. Against a non-dueling variant safeguard Lando. Drain pretty big, using all of your mains, beat them down when necessary.

SYCFA
Against the manipulator you want to either get out Goo Nee Tay quickly and they'll have problems altering it or you want to complete test #4 and then use it's text to get your mains out of your deck so Miyoom can't get them. Against a flip version you cam spread out on Cloud City and drain, their modifiers are cancelled, so you should be fine. Make sure to pull Obi if they try to make it A Day Long Remembered.

Court
Completing the tests hurts them. Honor should help you to not lose Force. If they occupy the three battlegrounds if probably won't be too strongly so you should be able to send a couple of mains in. Stack strong on CC, controlling 1-2 sites firmly, sabacc should hurt them. The Jedi Tests will also guide you to victory.

Thanks for reading.
