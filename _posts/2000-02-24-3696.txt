Strategy: 

Ok startegie is simple. Get Wuta on table quick:
- Deploy from hand
- Get him with Chewie (can get chewie with Madine)
- Get him with Madine (can get Madine with Balanced Attack)

The get your locations with Wuta. Deploy ewoks + an Ithorian to each site.
You drain a lot and are power a lot.

Don't forget the GT's of the ewoks and ewok weapons.

The powerful furballs strike

This is a basic layout of an Ewok deck. Adapt it or change it. All comments are welcome.
