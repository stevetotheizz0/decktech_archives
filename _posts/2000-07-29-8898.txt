Admirals Order(1)
We're in attack Position now

Strategy: 

This is a Ralltiir Operations deck that will set up big drains in space and hurt them on the ground.  Well heres some tech for you!

Admiral Chinraneau:  Hes great he adds to force drains at systems where u have a star destroyer!!
Sullust and Kashyyyk with a SD at both drain for 6 unless they come to you.. and with Something Special Planned for them its +2 to move their ships to the systems with a SD!!

We're in attack postion now:  Gives Star Destroys their much needed immunity to attrition and makes pilots deploy cheaper to ships.

I know what your thinking Romans would prolly screw this deck.	Well yes it would but i play tramples with and average destiny of 3 so i could prolly get him and be able to react.

What to do against popular decks

EBO:  Easy set up Search and destroy with Ice Plains or Wampa Cave exteneding the shields and try drain in space and on ground.

Profit:  Set up you planet sites for a constant drain of 1 at each site.. try to flip fast (they prolly wont come to you) get your space up and try to occupy some tatooine sites to stop some of their drains.

Throne Room:  This could be a hard game.  Try to keep your space sites heavily occupied with your stuff so you wont lose so much if they attack.. try to get bad feeling have i out fast to make their mains cost alot.

There is good in him:  dont go to his site cause then luke will be captured and that will kinda hurt you... try to flip with a walker at every site or have a lone guy with Tempest Scout 6 in your hand.. drain in space drain on ground.

Also this deck is good against Goo Nee Tay cause most of my stuff execpt like Vader, Tarkin and Chinerau are under ability 3.

Well try it out its a fun deck to play with high destiny.
