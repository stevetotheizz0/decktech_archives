Strategy: '

The name comes from the Final Fantasy 7 game, as a limit break of one of the characters(Barret).

Start usual Huntdown stuff, and IAO every time, except against ops. There are 3 extra TwiLeks, Crush, and 2 Evaders, which should do for Revo.
Get your two docking bays out, drop beefy stuff at each one, and drain. If they come after you, battle them away. Duel only if you must, or if you have set the destiny. This deck can make a big comeback, especially with IG-88 with gun and high destinies being able to effectively remove characters.
Search and Destroy is killer against HB and other non-interactive strategies.
Tracking destiny is key with this deck. Mistracking can mean bad things.

Against ops, start Battle Order, get Vader and Mara with sabers on the op planet and try to apply. If you expect to see lots of speeder ops, add a Crossfire and a Counter Assault.

If you have a question, drop me a message.
