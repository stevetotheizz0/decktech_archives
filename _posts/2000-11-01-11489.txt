Strategy: 

In Response to some reviews

I get to draw 3 battle destinies with boelo, Boba Fett w/ Blaster Rifle, Bib, and Mighty Jabba because......... Boba w/ rifle adds 1 destiny if with jabba, mighty jabba adds a battle destiny with bib, and I draw one for ability 4.

* This deck doen not a have a problemn at all with space decks because I can cancel their force drains plus i have some nasty retrieval (abyssins’ ornament, jabba’s twerps, scum and villany)


Well first off if this deck list is wrapping around my apologies. I dont know how to make it not do so.

Okay well usually when your playing this deck you start with the obj, reveal Myo as your rep, Desert Heart, Jabbas Palace, Well Guarded, Prepared Defenses, No Bargain, Oppresive Enforcement, and Power of the Hutt. Always try to enforce the Audience chamber with a good amount of characters, which isnt too hard to do with te abundunce of them. When you get a nice defense up on the chamber deploy a couple of aliens at the 2 other Jabbas Palace sites and start to drain your opponent. Make sure to get your Gailid out at this point or the game will be going alot slower then it has to. You shouldnt try to leave Tatooine, but you can if you want, if the LS is spreading thin out at other planets. Try to fight every chance that you get because you will most likely win against any lightside ground force.



This is the specific deck playing section.

Profit: This deck shoudl give you no problems at all. At the beginning of the game instead of deploying jabbas palace deploy the lower passages. Also deploy Boba Fett and Mighty Jabba compliments of your opponent. On your first turn deploy boelo from reserve deck with power of the hutts so you now have power 10, ability 10, forfeit enough to choke a horse, able to cancel a battle destiny, and drawing 3 yourself! Just play alonf the rest of this game as you would against any other deck but do not spread out thin because the mains will knock your eyes-ball right out of your head.

Hidden Base: Also another easy match up. You can usually spread thinner than usual against this deck because they dont have much of a ground force. This deck is easy to beat because once you get hutt influence on table they can hardly ever cancel any of your force drains. This game is merely a push over.

EBO: This deck could give you a little bit of a problem but still easy to win. When they start force draining you in space for plus 2 start putting down your myos on the obj to cancel them and also dont forget you can put abyssins on den of theives or lose them to the drain and retrieve them during your control phase. when you get myo down on your obj try to send him on a suicide missin so u can get him to regenerate back into your deck to canncel more force drains.

There is good in him: This deck can be an annoyence since you have no vader to take his luke. Try to out force drain him and also try to force choke him so he cant deploy masssive ground forces quickly. This game usually come out pretty close.

Card Explanations,

Jabbas Twerps: A destiny 6 card. Can deploy 2 abyssins from reserve deck as a react or can retrieve up to 5 force.

Myo / Abyssins: This is obviously the best race of aliens to use in this objective becauise of their regenerating ability. Also a nice destiny of 3 and power 2.

Wounded Wookie. A pretty nice utility card that has destiny 5 when your obj is flipped.

Well this deck is a very good deck and is also fun to play so have fun warming some LS behind with it. Also Drop me a line and tell me how the deck works if you make it.
