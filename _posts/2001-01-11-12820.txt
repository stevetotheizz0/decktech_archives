Strategy: 

This deck is really fun. Use mains and rats to beat down you opponent. When he comes to you beat him up or if you want stay on tat and drain for 10. This deck has supprisningly high destiny and its amasing when defending in a battle. almost at the end of the game retive unless your lossing by alot. it usally helps when your opponet loses the sense in his/her hand to a drain so the chimes are cancled.


Matchups:

BHBM/HD
Play Safe, make sure to drain and cancle visage with a spy and 2 rats. when he comes to get you forfit all the rats and the spy and leave. I’ve beeten this deck by 24 and 18.

Court
Not cool. Cancle scum and use choke. CHOKE IS GOD in this game.

Rall ops and others
Not sure. the most popular decks in my region are mkos and hunt down and bhbm. just play safe and drain for 10.

Ok,
Well this deck is good!

OK, the point of this deck id huge beatdowns on ground and major drains everywhere.

It uses Bo Shuda as a shield on Adience Chamber and camp Tessek and Kabe there. Now you drain plus one and rats deploy -1. it rocks!

first turn-draw about 3 rats and a narshuda and a take me to jabba now. there are 5 ways to get Kabe to the adince chamber, you can draw it in turn one or use the TMTJN(take me to jabba now).
Also try to get tessek and use the adiance chamber to pull bo shuda.

2nd turn- play the rats and get a barganing table and flip. then try for order to engage to make him/her lose early.

*when he/she comes to tat, use ke chu ke kukuta to get ride of some of his guys leaving one. then deploy 5 rats for 1 each and a main. draw a 4 and add another 4 to your battle power. this gives you 28 power with the rats alone.*


The percents:
0 destanies about 6%
1 destanies about 10%
2 destanies about 6%
3 destanies about 7%
4 destanies about 49%
5 destanies about 17%


you usally draw 4&#8217;s and 5&#8217;s wich is good!

*in the later game us the narshud and retrive between 8 and 12*

Dmain me or email me at noj73@hotmail.com
**************************************** New Strat:



Use the rats to drain like mad and kill there mains. Use the epps to break down the big guys like vader and tarken, use the it&#8217;s a trap to cancel battles and then drop 5 rats for 5 force and make him/her CRY!!!!


more the 50% chance of drawing a 4 destany.


Use bo shuda and AC to creat a shield. camp kabe tessek and Ariel Schous. (note: drop a fallen for the ariel, i messed up the list)

The drain for 3 and retrive a rat every turn.


then half way through retrive 10-14 force, so don&#8217;t hold back when battling in the early game.
