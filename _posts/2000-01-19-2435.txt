Strategy: 

Modifications on 2/1/00:
I realized I wanted to add You Are Beaten, not I Have You Now. I didn't realize that until today. Also, there are 7 locations and 17 characters not 8 and 16.

Yes, 2nd edition of my Hunt Down w/o dueling. I took out a Dune Walker and added Tempest Scout 3. I Have You Now, Crush the Rebellion, They'll Be Hell to Pay, Battle Order, and some new aliens. I figured Veers, Igar, Dyer were not necessary and I finally dropped Kitik. I took out some more SAC and added alot of counters. Crush will help me fish out Evaders, Hell2Pay is good against any interrupt heavy deck, Battle Order will help in drain protection, and IHYN will give me a way to deal with Luke since I don't use dueling. I kept most of the stuff the same other than the characters, blues, and reds.

Against Mains/Tosche Station: Play Security Precautions and you'll have just enough to get Vader out first turn to Tosche. Beatdown with Walkers. Use I Have You Now.

Against MWYHL: play Broken Concentration and drain alot. Doesn't have alot of drain modifiers so Test 1 isn't a big factor anyway. Come Back You Big Coward! to cancel retrieval if they don't occupy two battlegrounds. Use I Have You Know on mains.

Against Hidden Base: Start Resistance, use SAC against S-Foils/Yarna/Rebel Fleet early in game. Use ships to probe. Dengar excels against swarm decks. Try to get your Security Precautions out early.

Against ops: Use Bubo and walkers to beatdown on system. Battle Order will stop early drains.

Anything else: Start Bad Feeling Have I/Security Precautions and try to flip early. Get walkers out.

Against Odds: Use Resistance and beatdown.
