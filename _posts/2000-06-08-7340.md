Strategy: '

DOH There should be a Lost in the Wilderness and 2 Trans. Term. instead of the 3 snowspeeders. Sorry. Anyway, this is basically a speederOps beat deck, with CD and IHSAR helping with big blue. The only difference in this deck is that it has the laser cannons. These cannons let you hit vehicles by drawing destiny+2 greater than the armor or manuever of the vehicle. With so many 3s in the deck, AT-ST Rallops goes down in smoke Plus, they are very good for kiling EJP Dengar. (Against characters the cannons are -1, once again, with all the 3s Dengar will die). I would explain the rest of the deck but everyone has seen one of these things before so I will save you the trouble. '
