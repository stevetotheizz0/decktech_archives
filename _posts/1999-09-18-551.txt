Strategy: '

Plays much like a Mains and Toys deck...start MWYHL and Insurrection (TPIFF against Ops, ScrambledT against CCT). Has decent counters to all the hot decks. TPIFF for Ops, Speeders for Hunt Down (Obi and Luke CANNOT be dueled when their aboard a speeder), For Big Blue decks we have Power Harpoon and a match in forfeit and we should be able to overpower them in the main department. Good balance of ground and space. And the synergy between Insurrection,Mantellian Savrip,and Noble Sacrifice is incredible. Has a good regen engine and has pulled out a win against every deck Ive faced. (Its 1 and 1 against my DS Operations in a Can.)'
