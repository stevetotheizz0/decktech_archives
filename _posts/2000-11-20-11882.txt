Strategy: 

This deck uses spies and othet cards to reduce or cancel force drains on the gound and the EPP characters to battle any foolish imperials that come to the forest. The forest as long as the opponent doesn`t convert it protects you characters from attrition. You use the B- wings to battle in space and of course drain away. You get about 6-8 b- wings in 1 group and station them at a specific system (your choice)and the rest spread out. At the one system you deploy in force to, every turn once you get Order to engage down your opponent will have to loose 3 force or battle you and maybe loose even more than that. This deck has gone 5-1 so far. The only lose being against a Star Destroyer deck, where the opponent got out 3 Star Destroyers in only 2 turns and a Monooked me for 4 B- wings and 1 All Wings report in. That was my first game with this deck and I have improved since then. I lost that game by only 5 force though.
