Strategy: '


***Please Read Before Reviewing***

My normal start is IAO, Mob Pts, and YCHF.
(Get Rendili before drawing hand)

1st Turn - Activate 5.	Deploy Rendili and any other sites you have in your hand.  Deploy an imperial to the Landing Platform (preferably Endicott or Ozzel).  Then search for Ominous Rumors and deploy it (unless you're playing a TIGIH deck).  Then draw up.

2nd Turn - Before activating, if you're sure they're not playing numbers and you have a 2/2 Imperial or Ephant Mon, loose YCHF to get Perimeter Patrol.  Then activate 9 (depending if you had any other sites in hand) and force drain for 1.  Deploy a 2/2 Imperial or Ephant Mon to the Bunker and Perimeter Patrol.  Then deploy another guy to the Landing Platform for back up. Then draw up.

3rd Turn - Activate as much as you can and drain for 1. Now go into space for drains and apply as many beatings on the ground as needed.

**NOTES**
Admiral Chiraneau - I usually deploy him to Kashyyyk.  With him at Kashyyyk I get a +1 drain at Endor and Dantooine.

Vader's Personal Shuttle - I usually only deploy this to Endor while I have Perimeter Patrol going.  While Perimeter Patrol is going, you get an easy drain of 2 (maybe 3) and it allows you to build up on other planets without worry.

Against Popular Deck Types-

Profit - Start the normal stuff and don't put any aliens down.  Since most profit decks have little or no space protection you can spread out, but not to thin.  When the opponent sees Endor Ops, they'll think they won't have to worry about beatdowns (because Ominous Rumor decks usually don't have a lot of ground power). So when playing this deck, try to get a walker and other high power characters for a beatdown.

EBO - Start the normal stuff except switch IAO for Decree.  Then just battle them in space.  If you get out all the Endor sites, you should win because you'll be draining for 5-6 on the ground + whatever you're draining for in space.

MWYHL - Start the normal stuff and try to start getting some drains in space.  You want to drain as much as you can before they get Test 1 completed.  Also, try to get a whole bunch of characters on the Hounds Tooth or Vader's Shuttle so you can land on Dagobah and start battling.

TIGIH - Start the normal stuff and try to get Perimeter Patrol going ASAP.  You won't be able to deploy Ominous Rumors 1st turn but if you put an Imperial at the Landing Platform, they'll usually move Luke to the Landing Platform so he can get captured.  Then deploy Ominous Rumors 2nd turn and try to concentrate your power in space.  Also, be careful of Eloms. (Some possible tech cards you can add in are Overload, Luke Seeker, and/or Human Shield)
