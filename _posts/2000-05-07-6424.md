Strategy: '

Yeah, yeah, I know, another ROPS deck. But, this is the deck that I used to finish 4th with at my State Finals. It's very well tested and every card is extremely useful and economical. The basic strategy is flip fast then go after your opponent with exactly the cards you need, easy Here's why I use Biker Scouts over At-St's and pilots - Much cheaper, better forfit, immunity to attrition <4, better destiny, and THEY ARE DIFFERENT All this besides the fact that you can pull a biker from your reserve deck using your objective then, use the biker's text to pull a bike. You can't do that with At-St Ops.

Card Breakdown
Ability, Ability, Ability This card is great in a couple of situations. First, it can really make a training deck deploy lame characters early for you to beat on. Second, against Profit and mains this can really make them loose force since they have a limited character selection.

Always Thinking With Your Stomach The destiny of this deck is great so you have a good chance of putting a good character out for a while.

Surprise Tired of Revolution Decks? Make them revolve their own stuff for a change. The best is the look on your opponent’s face when you revolve his Rendezvous Point.

Tarkin’s Orders In this deck this card is just plain broken. You get you opponents system locked down and play this. Then next turn, use your two force, get Tarkin’s Orders back (it’ll be on the bottom of your reserve deck) and play again. Rinse and repeat.

Admiral Ozzel Nice game text and better deploy.

Bane Malar and Mara Jade The perfect pair for Profit.

Lt. Pol Treidum I hate spy’s on Ralltiir.

Mosep Makes your little annoying drains all the more annoying.

Navy Trooper Vesdan Numbers – eesh.

Disruptor Pistol No, it’s not trample but it can’t be “grabbed” either.

Specific Strategies
A lot of people are trying new deck designs these days so, this isn’t as important as it used to be but, none the less, here’s how I play things.

Hidden Base This isn't going to be too hard a match up. Make sure you get out Secret Plans. Use your ships wisely and boost your battle destiny as much as possible.

Profit Start Secret Plans and Bane Malar and Mara Jade. Get Mara her saber and move them next door to Tatooine Jabba's Palace first turn. Get Elis Helrot and transport those two over to a more secure location quick. Then, and this is key so listen up, SPACE DRAIN. I've yet to go up against a Profit deck with any real space power.

Throne Room You'll probably want to start with Imperial Arrest Order to prevent the good guys from getting onto your planet too cheaply. This will probably be your toughest matchup so play smart and cautious. If they Revo Surprise them so you'll still get force. Make sure you use your Evader wisely

That's about all I can think of right now. I'll probably add more strategy and comment on reviews later. I have done really well with this deck and it worked wonderfully for me during recent tournaments, including my States where I finished fourth. So, thanx for your time and reviews

Review Comments
MaStEr - Ya know, I don't normally resort to name calling and the such but damn, what a moron

Rooster - Man, wow, an Intelligent review WITH advice Thanks a lot. I don't think I'll really make those changes because I've already tried them. The one thing I did like was Imperial Decree - actually I've used that card in this deck before. It just really didn't help too much, what with everything in here being so economical. I played a heavy revo in a tournament with this and his revo's really didn't end up hurting too much. Yeah, it was a hard fought game but, I won. Also, I save my Alter for important stuff like Savrip. And I've been seeing the Executor as a real target lately anyway - it's just not economical and doesn't fit here. Thanks again though.

High Speed Tatics - Cool card, but not really necessary with good reacts.

Torture - Not really needed. If you see numbers inserted just stick with biker scouts - it won't hurt that bad.

JFunkAllStar - Oh, OKAY I understand now. '
