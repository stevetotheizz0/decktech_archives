Strategy: '

Before I begin, I want to add that I do NOT have Grand Moff Tarkin or a second Emperor Palpatine.


The strategy is rather simple.  I have two different beat down forces  One consists of Vader, Mara, Sim Jim, Janus, and Emperor, where as the other has Mighty Jabba, Xizor, 4-LOM, and Boba Fett.  These obviously can be intertwined if needed.


First turn, if you have the force, deploy Vader to either DS Docking bay or CC docking bay and flip.  Dont forget to grap an I Have You Now while you are getting your docking bay.  Depending on what deck I’m playing against and how much force they start with, deploy Rendilli using Mob. Points.


The whole strategy changes if I play against Jedi Training.  Then I start with Broken Concentration, which destroys any Jedi Deck.  And since you add 8 to any sense and altar destinies, you cannot cancel it.  If they start with Mind What You Have Learned and don’t start with The Way of Things or Wise advice, either they are stupid or they aren’t going to train, so I don’t deploy Broken Concentration.


Against and space deck  Get Vader down fast and Search and Destroy down fast.  That way they are losing two force every turn (yours and theyres).  Use you ships wisely.  Don’t underestimate the power of Emperors shuttle with Emperor and Sim aboard.  Plus, you can play I have You Now to add a third destiny and if you have another ability two ship present (dominator, Dengar in PO, Bossk in HT) you can get a fourth destiny from ability (Emperor and Sim don’t add ability because they are not pilots).


Its true I’ve lost some space battles, but only because of REALLY bad destiny draws or if he reacted a lot.


I hate to say "just play smart and you’ll win" because that has to be the dumbest saying I’ve ever heard, but if you battle against a lone X-wing when your opponent has 15 cards in his force pile, you deserve to lose.


Comments are welcome.


Thanks '
