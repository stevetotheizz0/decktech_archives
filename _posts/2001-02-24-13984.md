Strategy: '

Editor’s Note #1 Test #6 only works with Luke/DoS (I’m not even sure if it works with her).  I train Madine.  


Editor’s Note #2 for goodness sake, Steve ramsey  Stop rating my decks 2&1/2

stars.  send me a message and tell me what your problem is


Editor’s Note #3 I train Madine so I can get all three Generals and also so I can use Leia/Luke to fight with.  


Editor’s Note #4 Oops, my bad  I forgot to include the Endor Landing Platform and the Endor Back Door. ;)


I know this deck looks unorthodox, but try it.  It works.  Okay, start off YISYW, Wise Advice, and Strike Planning.  There are a lot of effects you can get out with the Insight,

but save until you know which one you need to get.  You have a draw phase, you have

The Signal x4.  Now, first turn go get Yoda and His hope with the obj.  If they give you

three force, then your going to get out Crix (the aprentice) turn one.  Otherwise, get him

turn two.  Get the first Test into hand first turn.  NEVER forget to get a Test each turn. 

After you beat the first, If you don’t already have it, go get The Way of Things with the

Insight, and the second test, ETC.  remember, you can beat tests 2 and 3 in the same turn

thanks to TWOT.  While you are testing over there, be using Crix’s gametext to go get a

scout each turn.  once you get Insurrection,  and therefore the Docking bay, or another

Endor site, deploy en masse.  You only need to hold the  Endor sites and drain (quite

easy), until you beat Test 5.  Then you ATTACK  Nabrun Leids or DB Transit a bunch

of characters to their weak point and let ’em have it  They may run away, but back them

into a corner or split up the force so they can’t run.  For retrievel, On the Edge will easily

get you 6 force each time.  (thanks to my 7’s). Cards I want to fit in Figran D’an (more

retrievel), Fallen Portal (more destructive), and Battle Plan (to stop drains from TIEs and

such).  You can get anything you need with #4, and 4 The signals will get all your

necessary effects.  If you can’t figure out why I have a certain card, don’t drop my rating,

D-mail about it and then decide.  Now for the Match-ups



Monkey TIEs Play as normal.  They’ll NEVER take endor from you on the ground.  Just

hold the Endor system and you’ll be fine.  


BHBM  Make ’em pay to their Obj. with LS, RS. They can’t take Endor from you on the

ground (no one can).  Wicket really screws them when he removes their lovely Mara from

the battle.  Close Air Support will kill them.


Hunt Down The Visage will hurt, but On The Edge and DTF will retrieve your stuff (you

can always track a 7, you have 4).  Once again, they can’t wrestle away Endor and you

will overpower them.


ISB keep to your stuff and let them keep to theirs.  You should win.


Dark Deal You kidding? They can’t touch you.


Anything else play the normal strat. and watch them fall. 


This deck may look like a pile but it really kills. D-mail me with any questions you have. 

Thanks for reading this.
