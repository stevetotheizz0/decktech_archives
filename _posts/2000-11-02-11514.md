Strategy: '

Okay the start is fairly simple. YISYW against BHBM and Hunt down(I may put TTs in instead of this bnut most people still have not purchased the JPOSTD), Menace Fades vs. ISB, Walker Garrison, Court ETC. First turn grab Madine and another General. Drop Madine grab Chewie and Wuta Put them all at the Landing site. Grab sites.

Card Explanations

Insurrection This is great to start versus other Ground decks. It let’s you pull the Docking bay (I’ll tell you about this later) and gives many characters a bonus.

I’ll Take the Leader This helps your ships, gives you a drain bonus at the docking bay AND let’s you recycle your dead ships for other pilots to hold Endor With. (Read my Tourney Report of the Grand Slam to see this in action.)

Scouts Most of them help by flipping and with text. The choices are fairly obvious.

Generals I was thinking about pulling an Ithorian for General Dodonna (Forfeit 7 with Insurrection) and pulling reactor Terminal for another Rebel Leadership. Please tell me what you think of that Idea.

Close Air Support This card Rules

Darklighter Spin This card is Money. I’ve used it to take down the Executor to Attrition. (two destiny’s this card and a 6).

Jek Porkins His Ship is God.

Sites The bare Esstenials. Not too Many not too few.

Matchups
BHBM-If he doesn’t pull force lightning you may want to stick a guy at the Throne Room, but I usually do NOT do this. Mind your own Business and just stop anything he drops to Endor. Give him Luke Eventually but only after you have established yourself.

Hunt Down-I’m thinking about putting in Trasnmission Terminated’s to counter this type of deck, but as I said before the JPOSTD hasn’t sold to many here yet.

RalOps-Dead for the most part. I can get a first or second turn Lando in Falcon to Raltiir to keep it from flipping...Gosh I haven’t played against a good RalOps in Ages I really don’t know what else I’d do.

TIEs-HOLD ENDOR Even if you can only keep your objective flipped for 2 or three turns it’s worth it. The Drain Bonuses make up for it.

Court-Honor of the Jedi helps, But play defensively. If the Damage get’s through drop Luke with Saber to a Tatooine site, but don’t spend to many resources.

Ending Notes This deck wins when the person playing it is able to form it to meet the situation. I have tried to balance Space and Ground and put in only the most effective cards. I would appreciate and suggestions I can get. Especially about the things that I have mentioned (General Dodonna, etc.)
