STRATEGY:

OK here it goes.  The strategy is really simple and it works the same for most deck.  You start by pulling out Carida befeor you activate by using Mobilization Point game text.  Then you activate and search for Endor DB with IAO, and then you search for the Emperor with the objective, and force lightning with the emperos game text, and then for I Have You Now by using Crush The Rebellion game text.  Deploy the Emperor at the Endor DB, wiht force lightning and i have you now you should be able to hold the site for the first turn, then u draw up and hope to get lucky.  This is for the first turn, the following turn you just have to play form you best judgment.  The deck is really easy to play, just deploy characters and kick the crap out of your opponent, and i you have time go turn Luke, but the deck is not bassed on turning Luke.

Thanx for reviewing my deck and have a great day and awsome summer.
