Strategy: '

This deck is weak against ground decks, so make sure to put in TK-422 and Boussh to block drains. The weapons devastate enemy ships, and Slayn & Korpil Facilities makes the weapons a retrieval engine. Launching The Assault is for drains,and I would have included 2, if not for deck space. This deck is good against RalOps, and BHBM. BHBM is harder to play, cuz unless, they’re using Tractor Beams, getting Luke out of Red 5/R2 is nearly impossible. This deck can obliterate SYCFA and Flagship Ops, because this deck usually has more ships. The weaknesses are Court Of The Vile Gangster, ISB, and Tusken Raiders (boy did I get my @#$% kicked by them). You can beef the deck up with EPP characters to fight ground decks. In closing, the following bands rule; Pennywise,old Offspring, Green Day, Nirvana, Slipknot, Blink 182 and NOFX.  '
