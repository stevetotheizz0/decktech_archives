this should have read above but it got cut out


”The title comes from our Regional. It was held in a mall with an indian/american restaurant and ”Sher-e-Punjab” was the name. I dont care who you are, the word ”punjab” is funny as hell. So, anyway, we made a fun game of just adding the word ”punjab” (pronounced poonjab) into random movie titles.  This one was my favorite.”


*******Edit************








Okay, first off, I give mad props to anyone this deck has beat already.  Its a beast and so far its only loss is to cheese (regional+ISB=Sunsdown+18 spies characters + 2x).


Okay, Ill break down card by card since yall love it so much when I do)


Starting is simple.  Hidden Base mains - we all know it.  Strike Planning to kill activation (although Im thinkin about switchin Endor to Anoat and letting me start a different effect rather than Strike Planning) for them, Twilight is Upon Me is unusal, but it lets you pull the The Force Is Strong With This One (TFISWTO) which is huge later and it cancels you are beaten.  You have to pay for it, but the deck activates a lot.  Rycar Ryjerd is tech.  Use him to go get Lightsaber Proficiency when youre plannin a beatdown (due it before you activate), deploy on your character with the lightsaber, if you lose your character, Proficency goes to the used pile and you resilence the lightsaber character and pull Proficency after you recycle (this is key when using Luke against Vader.  It gives you a power 8 and three destiny draws - four if lando down - and if you have Glancing Blow Vaders a power 0 forfeit 0).


Locations - dagobah to pull the Hutt is obvious, plus against This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time youve got a system to deploy The Planet Furtherest From on and Free Ride to cancel their Occupation.  Hologameboard can convert their holotable and you can pull it with the new Escape Pod.


Characters - Okay, heres where its easy.  QuiGon adds a destiny against Maul.  Luke adds two against Vader.  Lando adds one against anyone.  Obi is another character with a lightsaber.  Phylo is there cause everyone uses dockingbays mostly.  And Corran Horn to go against Hunt Down (Ive had Mara and Fett, BH come at him and he still only took one damage after the battle).  The object/idea is to get Luke and Lando against Vader.  Put Lightsaber Prof on Luke, hit vader, play glancing blow, and play TFISWTO.  Sounds like too much, sure, but, youve got an effect that lets you pull TFISWTO, Lando x3, Luke x3, and glancing blow x3.  On top of that, youve got Tunnel Vision x3 to get it all out easier.


Interrupts - they pretty much make sense.  Play the resiliences to get back your characters, escape pod to pull hologameboard and klorslug so they cant operate or dark strike or choke or force lightning anyone in battle.  And Ill explain glancing blow like this  First you have the absolute beatdown potential, then, think against Maul Strikes or HDADTJ that are playing dueling and Deep Hatred.  Now they can only use one combat card (well say its a seven) and if they dont play focused attack they only get one destiny that you will cancel.  So, if they dont see the glancing blow coming, they will be limited to a seven while you just have to get an eight with two destinys - not too hard for this deck.  And, if you lose, you can play resilience to cancel it anyway.  SATM/Blaster Prof is good just in case you need it, Control/Tunnel vision have several uses - canceling drains, canceling sense/alter war, and getting a desired card outta your huge activation pile.  Sense/recoil in fear lets you stop barrier or anything else (as long as you can draw low) or gives you a chance to get other cards in your hand.  Life debt to pull chewie,han,falcon and to add destinys, and TFISWTO because if they have Vader alone it wins you the game.  Bith Suffle/Desperate Reach cancels Barrier, and Free Ride/Endor Celebration cancels Occupations.  


Effects - KlorSlug saves you and makes Lando always a deploy of 5.  Planet Furtherest From is huge against decks like ISBgeneric,TDIGWATT, or anything else that plays a system and drains at related sites.  Honor to slow down the damage from Hunt Down.  Lightsaber Prof to make your battles do more damage, Goo Ney Tay to avoid Myloom and slow down the opponent (deck only gives up 3 icons for DS), and They Win This Round to retrieve some force after depleting a location.




Okay, Id do matchups, but heres all you really need to know.


Kill Vader.  If they drop Vader alone or even with just one other character you should win a huge battle and thus win the game eventually.  I have won the game in one battle before.  BHBM you have to stick Luke on Vader and use QuiGon and Obi with glancing blow to bring down Vader.  Hunt Down dont deploy without Resilience or Glancing Blow.


The only hard match is Space, but, wait for them to spread out to drain you completely out and drop down your beat up squad.  Plus the contols help to cancel drains in space and your tunnel visions can get Han,Chewie,Falcon and then use your life debts in space.


Have fun - its a beast.  '
