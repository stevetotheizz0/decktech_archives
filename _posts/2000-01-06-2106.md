Strategy: '

Start Objective and the west gallery, and IAO. No battle order is provided - i have found that this deck is as fast and heavy hitting as an operative deck. Set up your sites and flip with a battle destiny at each site - Dark deal + BCC provide the power bonuses to beef up your little guys. The deck is fast and the high desinies give it a good battling power. '
