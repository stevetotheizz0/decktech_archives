Strategy: 

This deck is great. Has done well in playtesting (2-0 against Hickey's profit...haha Charles, I'll beat you Wed., too.), and in Tourneys.	Basically play smart. Do what you have to. I have had this deck invade dagobah, dive guys into sandwhirls, put a sandwhirl out, and not flip, but letthem keep me flipped, kill Han (against profit), even though then I got beat down for about 10.  Do what you have to.
Why this is the way it is: 2 systems? Well, not a lot of LS space out right now. Profit being popular, I want 2 unconteste systems. RTP soon, they have not much space, etc. 2 Systems works. No Vaders Sabers? That's right. Vader is for hit n run off ralltiir, and the LS kills him so easily anyway, w/ 5s, sabers, etc. that getting him w/ his saber was e-z, but then he dies. So I went w/ EPP instead of the saber, and it has worked out great.

Tip for newbies playing this deck:
Your 1st turn dep. any locations in hand. and then count the # of your locations on table. At least 1, Ralltiir, plus whatever you deployed. Then grab a <> site. Count the # of locations in reserve deck. if those + # on table < 11, draw up for any locations in force pile. If those + # on table = 11, don't bother drawing, no locations. If those + # on table > 11, you screwed w/ my decklisting, :), or something is wrong (did you forget to start Ralltiir? :)
