Strategy: 

 
Okay, this deck is fun as hell to play, because the opponent never knows what your doing until they’re taking 10-15 damage per turn.

Start your jank, and laugh at the opponent because your hand starts out with one more card than him AND he has no idea what you’re playing.
If they start Strike Planning, don’t worry, all it does it put you one turn back.
My strat assumes strike planning isn’t on table.

Oh yea, and when you start, say, "I don’t have one of those new objective cards, I just have a starting Location." 

Turn One.
Deploy IAO, DS2.
Pull a Docking Bay.
Deploy Moff Jerry to the DS2 Docking Bay.
If the opponent gave you lots of force, twilek for Mob. Points
say, "may the force be with you"

Next Turn, Get Wakeelmui with mob points, find sinear fleet systems.  you’d be screwed if they grab Twilek, but no one does.

DS2 should be complete at end of turn 3.  
Hopefully, by then, so should the TIE platform.
And Hopefully, some more systems, too. (This deck was built before I aquired Cmd. Merrejk)

Move the DS2 to a system (Wakeelmui if you have to) and drain there, and Endor.  More systems will come, and you retreive a lot.
We shall double... makes the damage WORSE than Visage.  No Escape is not included, cause it’s easy to occupy 3 BG’s.
This deck can dish it out, and pretty quick.

My only sanctioned losses with this deck were to a WYS podracing deck. (not only does I Did It! plus First Strike kill ties, but I lost Wakeelmui off the Top--crap for luck)
and an EBO Y Wing, spread and drain for twenty ebo deck.  (That was a closer game-detailed in my Geneva TR)
so I’ve gone 4 wins 2 losses with this deck... It’s not an astounding record, but I’ve had fun playing it... Try it, and i’m sure you will too...

If you don’t know how to play TIE decks, look at Seth Van Winkle’s Page.  He pretty much Originated SYCFA TIES, and he’s good with them...
