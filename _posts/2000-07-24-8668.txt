Strategy: 

There shouldn't be much I have to say about this deck. It just plain rocks !!!

I added some new characters. Lord Vader is cool. He is a god with his lightsaber. Godherdt can cancel Landing Claw, Sarkli is a spy and stops force generation on opponent's 2/0's, and Chiraneau adds to space drains and is an excellent pilot.

The new ships are good: Flagship and Chimera.

There is a new start for this deck. Use prepared defences to probably pull IAO, Oppressive Enforcement and You Cannot Hide Forever.

The Admiral's Order kicks ass in this deck. Stops crazy mains drawing extra destinies at Ralltiir, and pulls combat vehicles.

Overall I still think that RallOps will continue to dominate and has only been made stronger with DS2.
