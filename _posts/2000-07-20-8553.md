Strategy: '

When I first saw the objective The Thing That Caught My Eye Was Vader Crosses To Light Side Totally Depleating opponets Life Force.So I Decided To Give this Deck a try and i think i did alright connsidering I am very confused as to whether you were sopposed to win the battles in space or on the ground.

So this is how I think you play the Objective.
In case you have not noticed this deck uses 15 cards that are destiny 5 and can be easily put back this will realy help once you get to trying to draw a destiny of 15 not to mention winning 4 battles to make it possible to finish the objective.

Also I don't have any idea of what starting effects to use for this deck.THe ones that I have Really suck so please help with this deck. '
