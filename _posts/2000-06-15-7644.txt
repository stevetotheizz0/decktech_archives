Strategy: 

Blah Blah Blah.  It's mains and toys.  Does wel against most decks. EBO could be problems...i'm thinking of adding in a feew wampas.
Get out Jade and audience chamber 1st turn. drop mains, holo table, soon you'll have 3 drains going(jade and back up at audience chamber, vader w/ a saber at chamber w/ back up.  and holograms at the table.  hat's a drain for 5 that can't be smacked. plus if they even try just YAB them.

Matchups:
any Mains deck just battle, battle, battle. ngetting out jade 1st turn will help, and capturing one of their characters at the begining of the game will be key.  battle them out, drain at holotable, track destinies with your ships and characters to win battles.

Profit: easy win.  drop jade and jabba. then drain on cc. don't let tjhem free han and drain them away in soace and cc.

Opps:
get your Dbs out and move vader and jade to their planet and battle them out.  drain in space and at teh holotable.

Heavy space:
set up search and 2 drains of two.  monnok them early.	resistance will be key, get battle plan out.  drop fett and bossk at key situations to batle them in space. should't be a problem.

Numbers:
easy win, you start with resistance, nuff said.

Hardest matchup is prolly mwyhl manip, but key drains early should be able to win you this one.

that's about it.  email me any qustions.
