Strategy: 

This is a standerd hunt down deck so i wont go into to much detail on how to play it cause most people know how to play a huntdown deck.

Basicaly just pull the docking
Bays out and rendili to get force
activation going get vader to a
docking bay and let visage do
its thing if they deploy jedi
on you than dual there @#$% and
make them lose some force.And how
much of a beatdown can they muster
up if i have taken obi and luke
out of the game

Cards I would like to put in but cant find room or dont have it.

Palpatine
Another Mara
SEarch And Destroy
Crush The Rebelion
Evader
Imperial Decree

Matchups

Hidden Base
Wait till they flip deploy
security precations.Probe
there base make them lose
force.dont get beatdown in
space.It could be close
pending skill of opponet but
you should win.

New Objective
Do your normal stuff hold a barrier
in you hand so if they come to you
you wont get beaten that much.

Profit
Go to tatooine and beat them
up. This should be a easy game if you
can duel ben out of the game and cross
luke to the light side.just be carful about
the new lando.

TIGIH
Pick luke up fast and dont lose battles
let visage do its thing.just drain at
heavily fortified sites so he cant win battles
you should win this one big time.
