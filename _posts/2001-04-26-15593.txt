Umm...I’m horible at writing Stategy

Contrary to popular belief it is not recommended that you take advantage of Your Destiny because more often then not they will deploy luke to same site and flip objective early in game, THIS IS BAD. It’s not good to lose any force let alone from yourself, so wait until you have won your battles to deploy Vader so you can pretty much safely cross him to the dark side of the force.  

What you do with this deck if you didn’t already know is to win at least four battles, then you deploy Vader and duel luke you win. Sounds simple huh well it is pretty simple if you do it right. First build a reasonable hand and set up activation ASAP, then if they deploy any Characters to a battle ground site you should be able to deploy massive amounts of characters(only deploy as many characters as you need to over power them with Troopers, its not with TA because all your troopers double their power. If you fear throw me another charge then wait until you have more than one trooper assault in hand to battle because TMAC is unique and TA isn’t. If you fear multiple destiny’s to easily over power you never fear Guri is hear(they can draw only one Battle destiny). You should have enough characters to win at least four battles. If you feel it nesisary track your trooper assaults and Twi’leks as best you can to win. Trust me this isn’t a hard deck to play.
