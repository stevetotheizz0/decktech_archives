Strategy: '

This deck is a very good Tatooine.  You can either rescue Han early and flip the Objective or you can sit it out and drain.  Then, rescue Han and retrieve the lost force that you need or want.  Master Luke is a great help, because of his ability to get rid of aliens.  Also, if you are having problems saving Han, then just play Someone Who Loves You, save General Solo, and run away or play ECC Chewie.  Once you save that old pirate, you should just take out as many people as possible and make them lose some force for each battleground site.	Have Fun '
