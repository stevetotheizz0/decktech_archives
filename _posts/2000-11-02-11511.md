Strategy: '

I HAVE A TYPO, IT ISN’T 3 IMPERIAL ARREST ORDERS, IT IS SUPPOSED TP BE 3 IMPERIAL BARRIERS  Start by Pulling a DB, DS war room, and Rendilli if you started Mob. POints. If you got a Jabbas Palace, put it out and get audience chamber. Then next turn get a DB, and deploy some guys from RD with Power of the hut, or wait. its up to you. Get a vader and go hunting with you inperials. PLay Circle on ben, then nail anyone who is left. Go to space if you have to, but it isnt neccasary. Have fin with this one	'
