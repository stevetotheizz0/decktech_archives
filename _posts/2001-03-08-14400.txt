Strategy: '

***UPDATE*** - Oops.  I forgot the ruling about the monnok with Tunnel Vision and the combo card.  Thanks to those of you who pointed it out.  I also forgot the part about Dont Get Cocky which says it only kills Tie/lns and not Interceptors which I thought it did.  Take both of those out and throw in 2 Run, Luke, Run to deal with dueling and using Luke for beatings on the ground as well.  Also, since DCG is out, replace EPP Han with Capt. Han to boost the space in the deck.***END UPDATE***

First off, the title of this deck is a Simpsons quote. Remember the episode where Homer tries to find out his middle name?  Grandpa says it when he talks about his role in raising Homer. Funny stuff IMHO. 

Thanks to everyone who helped me with the 1st version of the deck, except BobaFett fan who gave me a 1/2 star for no reason, and has done the same to others as well.

This updated version has the tools to counter almost everything including Ties w/Cannons which are the bane of most WYS decks.  The space is a bit weaker, but with Tunnel Visions and Squadron Assignments, controlling Tatooine isnt too hard.  The main change was to add more characters in order to flip earlier as well as to provide more staying power later in the game 

Anyway, this is the 2nd version of my new WYS step which Im submitting here for review and any comments you may have. The basic strategy is to flip early, and abuse the lost interrupts. Get control of Tatooine early, and establish some solid drains at the 2 docking bays with the Ill Take the Leader.  Tatooine Celebration is used for small chunks of retrieval to get around Secret Plans.  I realize that its not original, but there are some card chocies which warrant an explanation, and here they are 

Doubles of Talon and Melas - Talon is the man for upping those smugglers forfeit and protecting your guys.  Melas is the best co-pilot with Dash to get around Zuckuss in Mist Hunter, and getting him early is key.

Bantha Droid - losing a game to Lateral Damage sucks.

SP DB - Yes, No Escape is an issue, but if I suspect the opponent is packing it, I wont deploy it. It makes for easy deployment with the Falcon and Outrider since freighters deploy -2 at the DB. 

Only 3 Palace Raiders? - Theyre all I have, and I find that these 3 work well overall.

A Few Maneuvers - easily trackable 6 which can help keep a ship up in the air versus Tie Cannons.

Shocking Info/Grimtash - A lot of Dark Side decks rely on multiples.  Tunnel for this and make them pay.  The shock part can kill mylliom(sp?), and dont forget that you can use it twice with WYS

Sorry About the Mess/Blaster Proficiency - A way to get around UC spies and it can be used offensively as well twice with the flipped objective.

The Bith Shuffle/Desperate Reach - its a trackable 5, screws up their tracking, and you can also cancel barrier for beatdowns.

Last time, I was lazy, and I didnt post matchups, but here they are for you to check out.

Vs Huntdown  Cancel Visage ASAP with the OOC/TT combo card.  Flipping quick can shut down his early activation.  Run Luke, Runs protects Luke from Vaders Obsession, so their dueling is useless.  The Bith Shuffle can mess up his tracking as well as Talon.

Vs. Bring Him Before Me  This is the reason EPP Luke is in here.  Use him for recursive beatings until the time is right and give them Jedi Luke.  Flipping early will also be very beneficial in this game.  Win battles with your high destinies, and retrieve any damage with Celebration.

Vs. Scum(Court, MKOS, CCT)  Fallen Portals and Barriers are the keys in these matchups.  Take control of Tatooine and dont give it up.  They have lots of tricks, but so do you.  Use the Patrol Crafts to protect key characters and Talon will help out versus ECC IG-88 and company.  I might add an Aim High for this match-up.

Vs. Ties  This is the deck I was most worried about when I built this deck.  If its SYCFA (which it most likely is) flip early to hinder them.   A Few Maneuvers helps out with the guns.  Keep control of the Tatooine system, play smart, and you will win.

Vs. Anything else  Flip quickly and react to whatever theyre doing.  This deck is versatile, and can beat just about anything with some luck and smart playing.

Any suggestion are welcome, and if you give this a low rating, at least give me an explanation other then its been done or this sucks like Ive seen in the past. 

Thanks for reading,
