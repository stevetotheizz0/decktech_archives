Strategy: '

Use Scum and Villiany along with First Strike to gain 3 force each time you initiate.  You may use Projective Telepathy to cancel the battles you initiate just to get the force back.  Use Death Mark on their Han or other smuggler on the Great Pit with the Sarlacc there.  Everything else is self explanatory.
