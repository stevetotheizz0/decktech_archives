Strategy: '

Set up echo base ops with your Baraguins and Lea if possible. Give her the electrobinocs and use her for on the edge. Get luke or han on Red 5. Have on ship sit at each system then just hyper escape away or use Rebel barrier (there are 2 I forgot to add).  This way you can track your destinies with the binocs and know when to use On the Edge and Surprise Assult. Figrin Dâ€™ann ALmost never loses with the great destiny in this deck.	Use the 3 Baraguins you can get out to lose then retrive 3 weapons or devices each turn. THis should stop some force loss, but you should do fine with your Figrin daan and On the Edge.  Have fun with this one. '
