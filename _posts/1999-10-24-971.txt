Strategy: '

This deck is well rounded and can take on almost
any deck.

It may have trouble with inserts but i have not seen
a dark insert ina long time.

It can beat beatdown.....track 5's and use smoke screen =
everything gone.

It does well against hunt down...if you get the higher force activation....you win

this deck is made to go anywhere...
it is so fast, and with the epp's you can bring the beat down.'
