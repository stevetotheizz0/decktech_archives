Strategy: 


Hey I have posted a updated version of this deck called ”The POWER of the UNDERWORLD.” So if you wanna review that instead please go right ahead (b/c some of my strategy in this version isn’t consistent with my cards since I pulled some stuff). Thanks.

Thanks and LMK if you want any decks reviewed.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
CHANGE Spaceport DB to D*2 DB (just for force)
CHANGE 1x control to Tat: Jabba’s Palace
CHANGE 1x Imperial Barrier to None Shall Pass

<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>
NOTE: This is a long strategy section so if you don’t feel like reading it please review this deck another time. I spent one hour writing this up so please don’t disregard my work. Thank you.

This is my version of Steven Lewis* (Sir Yoda) *Invincible Court* and I would like to give all credit for the foundation of this deck to him. When I saw the Invincible Court deck I thought is was a very strong deck but needed a few changes. I have now gone ahead and made my own version of Steven*s deck with my own twist thrown in. So far I really like how the deck has turned out as well as my changes. Now I*m sure you all have seen Steven’s deck (if you haven*t go to The decks section and click on *Invincible Court*) so I won*t go through the basics again. But what I would like to do is show you the changes I made and why I made them.

PLEASE REMEMBER WHEN REVIEWING THIS DECK that I do not need much force. With Scum & the cheap Bounty Hunters (and ships) you don*t need much to deliver crushing blows.

STARTING: I have changed the start around and yanked No Bargain (since you will find that not all the battles happen at Jabba*s Palace). In place of No Bargain I start Mobilization Points so that on the first turn I can pull Rendili as well as activate more at my docking bay (this start makes my force activation much better). I also start Power of The Hutt in favor of There is no Try to make having a CC engineer unnecessary. The reason for this being that Steven used the CC engineer to convert back the chamber to allow him to pull Beolo and activate 1 more force per turn. But since that I start Power of the Hutt I can just pull Beolo right from my reserve deck (as well as Ephant Mon) and with Mob points activate more then normal without using up space for a CC engineer (who is worthless after converting the chamber). ONE BIG THING TO REMEMBER is that starting Mob points allows me to activate 3 more force (D*2 DB & Rendili) then if I started No Bargain. Also it gives me Rendili which can be used to satisfy Battle Order (which is bih in MWYHL decks.) I don’t see how you would win against MWYHL using battle order unless you deploy to a system like Rendili. This is another HUGE reason to have Mob points in instead of No Bargain.
If you try the deck out I think you will find this start much stronger.

Cards in-Cards out: I took out the following from Steven*s deck

*YOU CANNOT HIDE 4EVER* - With 3 Twi’lec Advisors I can pull Security Precautions as well as Search & Destroy quickly.

*SECRET PLANS* - I yanked Secret Plans b/c 1) MWYHL is dead in my area & 2) It really doesn’t help that much. I guess if I lived in a region that used MWYHL a lot I would add it but it’s not worth it for me.

*NO BARGAIN* – As I said, this deck does not need this card and it just wastes a starting effect slot.

*CANTINA & JABBA’S PALACE & D*2 Docking Bay* – I found that Cantina really wasn’t a good drain site since it is far from Jabba’s Palace and it gives the lightside a good drain site. I pulled Jabba’s Palace in favor of Spaceport Docking Bay since I can pull the docking bay as well as activate more there. Also with me getting Rendili out on the first turn the D*2 Docking Bay really wasn’t needed anymore.

*CC ENGINEER & ORS* – I already explained about the CC engineer in that he just takes up space when Power of the Hutt is much better. And I just didn’t have room for the 2nd ORS. If HOTJ is dead in your area stick another ORS in for No Escape (but make sure b/c HOTJ can really hurt).

*OOTA GOOTA, SOLO & HUTT SMOOCH* – I know it would be very nice to use Oota Goota, Solo but with the HUGE use of IOA (like 90% of the decks use it) is anyone gonna even play Nabren (people in my area don’t). Also I pulled Hutt Smooch in favor of a second Sniper. I mean really this deck has SO MANY weapons and Sniper can be used to toast undercover spies as well as many other uses.

Now for cards I added:

*POWER OF THE HUTT* – This card is a MUST in this kind of Court deck and it works MUCH better then a CC engineer. If you think my version if weaker against Profit then go look at my start VS Profit below (it is much stronger then the CC engineer).

*NO ESCAPE & REACTOR TERMINAL* – I added No Escape b/c HOTJ is still used in my area and b/c I am really afraid of HOTJ. You could pull it if you know you won’t play anyone using HOTJ. I added Reactor Terminal b/c it is in every deck I use. If you don’t like it yank it for a card you do like.

*DANNIK JERRIKO* – This boy is just too good to leave out of this deck. I mean this is a mains killer right? Well wouldn’t it be nice if after you killed a main he stayed gone? Well Dannik can do this for you. He is just so sweat against mains (especially b/c this deck is designed to kill mains) and can be used to place out of play your opponent’s alien leader. This guy is DA MAN !!

*MOBALIZATION POINTS & RENDILI* – This is the way this deck was supposed to work. Since I start Mob points I can pull both the D*2 DB & Rendili from my reserve deck on my first turn giving me a sure 8 force per turn instead of 6. Rendili is also a place for 1 or 2 of your ships to drain at if your opponent is playing all ground (otherwise use ships to hit & retrieve).

Now after all that here are some deck matchups:

VS PROFIT:
Really a piece of cake. What you do is start Mighty Jabba & Mara as your 2 aliens. On your first turn pull Rendili and D*2 DB as well as Mara’s stick. Then pull either Beolo (cancel a battle destiny) or Ephant Mon (adds one battle destiny b/c of Mighty Jabba’s gametext) with Power of the Hutt. Next turn activate 8 and deploy either Ephant Mon or Beolo (whoever U didn’t deploy the first turn) and whatever else you want to do. Wow, you already have power 14, a saber swing, 2 destinies, and you cancel their destiny, which you did all without the CC engineer. Once you get Scum & First Strike out you will be rocking away. Just battle & retrieve and crush those mains. If you can get Han, Luke, or, Obi captured or placed out of play the game is over. Use your disarmed, hidden weapons, etc to just mow down everything in site.

VS Hidden Base:
I would start thin Jabba since there are a lot of Hidden Base main decks being used right now and you don’t want Scum being altered (change the Jabba later if they don’t have SAC). Get set up and get out your effects as soon as you can (use your 3 Twi’lecs) and see what they do. If it is mains & toys sit back and drain and let those bad boys come to you. When they do promptly slaughter them present them to Jabba (for his amusement) and continue on with life.
If you are playing a real Hidden Base deck then get S&D established as well as your objective. This loss = 3 per turn and when you add your drains to this total they will be hurting. Use hit and run attacks to retrieve 3 and make them lose 1 (Scum & First Strike) and probe their base when they flip (if they don’t flip they are dead). As Steven said, the direct damage of this deck just kills them.

VS MWHYL
This will be the hardest match since Test 1 & Test 2 hurt a lot. But, as Steven said, if you get out fast & get your objective and S&D going they are history. If they deploy mains before completing test 5 they will be easy to kill with your tricky cards. If they don’t they will lose so much force that even if they flip it won’t make a difference. Dannik can be very big in this game if you place either Luke or Obi out of play before they flip.

VS Y4 mains:
This deck will be easy. Once you get out No Escape you will be activating a ton. Since TR mains is a reactive deck they will come to you, which will allow you to start a slaughter with your nasty cards. Use Scum/First strike to retrieve a ton and kick your opponent’s mains out of the galaxy.

VS There is Good in Him
As Steven said don*t deploy Mara near Luke and just pound him with your combos. Elom swarms won’t hurt at all. Really a very easy game.

VS. Rebel Strike Team
I just love how Steven says this so I just have to quote: *HA! you win. Wreck his guys and drain for tons. Most Strike Team decks can’t handle your heavy interrupt package. If he wants to drain for 1 at Endor, let him.*

 Thanks guys for looking at this deck. I hope you like my changes and will give me constructive reviews. Please don’t give me low rating b/c you say I copied the deck. I think that I made enough changes to call this my own deck. I once again thanks Steven for the GREAT foundation of this deck. Thanks guys !!!
