Strategy: 

if you think the character look weak, your don't know yet the power of the musicians from HELL
i have saw ben kennobi + luke epp + han epp run away from them

the stategy is pretty simple with the SP+shocking revelation look for your system
deploy to the AC until its full and deploy to your system with battle order and the lost of force from the obj he will come to ground then you elis your brady bunch and POW battle damage
if he play insurection put only what you need to the ground and keep some character to your hand
if you have a projective telepaty in your hand you can even battle with a lone musician( you retrieve 3 he lose 1 then cancel the battle )
like this your character and ship always get back in your deck and with all those high destiny easy to track you will have no problem winning the big fight
have fun( its real fun to play and it work )
against hidden base just wait until he flip
then deploy and probe( if he dont flip he have to come to the ground then POW)
