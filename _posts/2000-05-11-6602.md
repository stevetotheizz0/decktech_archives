Strategy: '

The standard TDIGWATT strategy presides. Start Broken Concentration against MWYHL and against anything else start Any Methods to pull the prison and a hunter of your choosing. Always start with the CC chamber. This insures that All too easy will not be wasted and the early activation is critical to this deck. The bounties are added for the eventual needd of force retrieval and along with CC boba fett (who does have his uses here) I can bounty a spy, smooch them and retrieve +3 force. This hurts if it's Boushh or TK-422 in a HB deck or possibly Profit.
The basic capture cards are in, destiny is high and the ample supply of imperial/alien combo assures that my draws will be satisfactory. I enjoy playing with the All Too Easy because quick force loss is attractive to me. Add two sabers and a DD at the carbon chamber and a drain of 5 is very hard to ignore. One battle and a quick slashing of a saber and the opponent loses 8 force instead of 5 to a drain. I added the interrogation room cause draining with prisoners is extremely fun, especially if it the site is place between the chamber and the prison.
Why the Biker Scouts? Read their GT and you'll understand. their perfect for cheap deploy, quick Dark Deal and possible CC Occupation and then move them together and they can hold a site on their own. (Beware of the Obi-Wan Kenobi However.)
This ddeck is very simple and focuses on power heavy and those beautiful drains. It may not be original but I did try to add my own flare to it. Also I needed to be put into active mode and this was the only deck I felt I could trust to post. I'd like to add a Search and Destroy for extra force loss and a grabber and I replaced the executor for an extra Dreadnaught but I think the deck holds well on it's own for the most part. Please offer constructive criticism. '
