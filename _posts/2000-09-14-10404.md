Objective
There Is Good In Him/I Can Save Him
'

Strategy: '

This is a mix deck, its one part objective (there s good in him/i can save him) and 2 part ewok deck  first you use the ewoks to beat your opponent in battles, therefor stacking a card on to "i feel the conflict". then you devestate your opponent by turning vader, and depleting his life force pretty cool huh?

any way, the ewoks in there all get power from DOS, ithorians and wokling....at back door, or hiddem trail, they are at leats +4 or more depending on how many ithorians you have Then there is chewie just to have some fun with...that makes for a kick @#$% deck that you can win with even withou completing the objective  '
