Strategy: 

this deck got many high destiny and can retrieve with figirin, celebration, off and on the edge, and baragwin that a lot of retrieve
secret plan and come here dont hurt because you occupy your 2 battleground with no difficult and for secret you never pay a large amount of force(baragwin +1, figirin +1, celebretion 1 to 4, off and on 4 to 6)
the goal of this deck is easy protect bespin with lando in boat for celebration(event if it is cancel it doenst matter you have other ways for retrieving)
for the charater dont panic you can look every turn in your deck so like this you now exactly what is in your force pile( use tunnel vision to get what you need)
i forgot there suppose to have a surprise assault in the deck
and the x-wing gun is for get rid of those bounty hunter(real easy 3+destiny>maneuver immediatly lost)

so before giving a half star(that what i will get, because iam 100% sure you wont like it)
take time and thing of all the posibility of this deck
