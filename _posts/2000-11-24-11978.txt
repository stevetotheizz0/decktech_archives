Strategy: '

Okay Here’s how it goes I have destiny adders so that if they come down with there " ALL BIG POWERFUL SHIPS" they’ll have to lose em in attrition.
After Your turn leave force at the pile and then when they drain lose an Intruder Missle then 1 force to retreive it then lose the same one again and one force to retreive it and  you could do this 3 timnes a turn which could save the game.
Your starships have prity good immunity especially when you get their matching pilots as-well and then you are away also If  you move Kashyyyk is the safer place to go with the dark side of it saying "Total ability of 6 or more required for you to draw Battle destiny here" so that is safe form that pesky attrition.

Vs Cloud City Dark Deal Drain race you should be able to hold out with the weapon retreiving and you usually will be able to get EBO out quicker then their dark deal it will be a tight one but you should come out on top.

Vs Endor Opps Don’t let out into the skies  and then get your menace fades up and going but watch out for the beat down.
If you control the skies you should win.

VsBring Him Before Me Give them Luke and then chose your battles wisely only when you are going to win the drains are going to hurt them badly.

Vs Rep/Court Both pof these will fall quickly as long as you get EBO out quickly don’t try and attack them just folllow the game plan of retreiving and draining and you will win (Easy Win).

Vs Big Blue You should keep to Hoth where you have haven and wait for them to come and attack you which they will cause people that play big blue don’t doubt their own defences.
Once they come add destinies madly and destroy thme with attrition.
It will be a slow game but surely will turn out in your favor.
