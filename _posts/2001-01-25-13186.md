Strategy
Get out Mos Eisley as soon as possible so you can do the cantina shuffle. Use The Signal to Pull Tatooine Celebration, then pull Dash using the Outrider (or vice versa), Captain Han with the Falcon (or Vice versa). Once you get out one of those ships (perferably the Outrider) deploy it to Tatooine system and deploy Tatooine celebration. Put Wedge Antilles aboard the Outrider with Dash (or the Falcon) and you have almost garuntee control once you get out No Questions Asked. When No Questions asked is on table and Dash is piolting the Outrider it is Immune to attrition less than 6. Use the Admirals order to shoot people during your control phase.
