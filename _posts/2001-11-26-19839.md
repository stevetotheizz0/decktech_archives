Strategy: '

This deck is just like a throne room mains beatdown deck. There is loads of activation and not much for the opponent. Imperial arrest order is to make the unique troopers forfeit +2. get your sites out, save up the force and beat them down, when you initiate a battle you retrieve 1 and the opponent loses 1 cause of first strike, elis herlot is if your stuck somewhere and the opponent is somewhere else play it and it`s a good beatdown card. First strike makes them pay a force every time they play an interrupt in battle, the shield for podracing for cancelling I did it unless they occupy 3 battlegrounds, which then is a good chance for a beatdown


For the beatdown you`ve got Vader with lightsaber, 4 copies, you are beaten to exclude a character, trooper assault makes you troopers power+2, dark jedi presence makes your imperials double power when with a dark jedi, presence of the force if there hiding in a non battleground, play it and you can beatdown. If in a battle you`ve got Vader, 3 unique troopers, tarkin and venka and kir kanos, if you have it play you are beaten to exclude a big character from battle, play trooper assault to make troopers power+2, then play dark jedi presence to make all your imperials double power, troopers= power 8 each, grand moff tarkin and venka power 8 each and kir kanos power 10, it all adds up to power 50 and battle destiny and you can chop someone with the lightsaber.


If they just hang around in space you`ve got big space power, chimaira and most of the bounty hunter ships, lateral damage makes an opponents starship power 0, zuckuss makes them have to have ability 7 or more to draw battle destiny, thrawn adds a battle destiny, bossk in hounds tooth adds a battle destiny, you`ve got 2 space locations to drain at, presences add to the drains, but the main idea of this deck is to beat down their characters on the ground.


vs we`ll handle this

Good matchup, they play on ground and you beatdown on ground, you start with a lot of force, get you locations out and get a good hand, reactor terminal you can put cards in your used pile, when you see an opportunity to battle go for it and beat them down, that should make them lose a bit of force, get your space out and drain there and on ground, they`ve probably lost good characters when you done your beatdown, drain and win


vs rebel strike team

another good matchup, they play on ground, just get your locations out, and get your cards in your hand, you are beaten can exclude a big character from battle, beat them down and they lose force, drain in space and on the ground at their sites.


vs there is good in him

another good matchup, most the same as the others, get your sites out, save the force up and beat them down, you are beaten can exclude luke, if they play frozen assets on your force pile, you play the defensive shield and it`s cancelled, we`ll let fate a deicde huh, drain and win


vs EBO 

Play battle order so they will go to a battleground, north ridge and then you beat them down there. You`ve got a lot of space power to beat up the opponent in space, drain and win,


vs hidden base

hard matchup play battle order so they go to ground if they have characters, space power can take over a couple of locations, lateral damage can make an oppoenets starship power 0, hopefully you will do a beat down and drain them and win.
