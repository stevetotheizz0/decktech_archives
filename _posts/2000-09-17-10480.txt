Strategy: 

Also Endor Operations/Garrison is Destroyed is in the deck for a Speeder Bike.


Alright well you start with Imperial Arrest Order, You Cannot Hide Forever and Battle Order.

First turn- You activate your force and deploy any sites you have in your hand.  Next turn deploy some an ability 2 Biker scout with 2 other Biker scouts and deploy 2 Speeder Bikes from deck with another Speeder Bike at 2 different locations leave 2 force left and draw the rest.  Now you activate your force and deploy more Biker scouts and drain.  Deploy more locations, deploy Ominous Rumors and Establish Secret Base.  You want to Have Search and Destroy to hurt them and also it adds to your scouts forfeit.  Imperial Arrest Order also gives you more Forfeit.  You deploy Executor, and like 2 Bounty Hunter Ships to Endor and drain for 5 there because of Establish Secret Base, Hewix adds 1 to your forfeit of your troopers.  So basically your troopers are forfeit +4.  You drain in space and you can retrieve with your objective.  React to battles if they come to you and slaughter them.  You drain for a lot and the deck is really fast.  So thats basically the strategy.  You will rarely lose battles also because you have high forfeit with high power.
