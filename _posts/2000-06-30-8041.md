ERROR - Switch the Imperial Square for the Med Chamber.

Whaddya know? It's more ROps. However, this one has been modified for the post Third Anthology environment. This can usually wipe the floor with EBO, and RTP will have difficulty staying alive on the ground. I really think ROps is one of the few decks that has fully survived the TA onslaught, and it is still one of the most balanced and versatile decks around.
I modified this to counter most anything degenerate, that's why there are cards like Resistance and S+D. Come Here You Big Coward is great in here, as often people go try to drain at my twix sites, not happening. Secret Plans because of the Baragwin deck and retrieval is big in my meta. Decree is universal, ruins standard EBO decks.
At the Regional I lost to retrieval and Odds (with THREE Tortures), so I think I am prepared now. This deck is strong and really universal. No Revo protection because, hey, who has the balls to play it?

Vs. Ops
Decree and the -1 will kill 'em.

Vs. EBO
Decree and the -1 will kill 'em. OR you can use the chickens to spread and cancel EBO. This isn't hard to beat.

Vs. M&T variants
Tough match, but if you play the cards right, you should pull it out. Coward will nullify early drains at your twix sites, use the 4 Alters to kill Savrip, the Tank, etc.

Vs. HB
Probe until you find the base. That's pretty much it. Block their biggest drains and wear them out with yours.

Vs. Odds
I have Vesden, and even added Resistance to stop Odds. This is about the best deck you can play against Odds.

Vs. Whatever else
C'mon it's ROps, you people know what to do.

That's all kiddies.

Darwin bless. Hoostino out.  '
