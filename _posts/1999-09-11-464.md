Strategy: '

Your starting stuff will depend on your opponent's SL.  Start TJP against an opponent who also starts TJP or the Audience Chamber against operatives (for A Gift).  Goo Nee Tay is for Hunt Down and Tosche Station is for anything else.   Because Figurin D'an is the only way you can retrieve force, concentrate on stopping your opponents drains first.  If they deploy a large squad somewhere, you can pick it apart with Sorry about the Mess, You Are Beaten and destiny adders.	Besides the wonderful destiny of Artoo, he can fetch and use A Gift, which just plain wrecks operatives(just have a Nabrun for Droid detector and a Sense for Look Sir, Droids or Nevar Yahnal).  Harc Seff and Projection of a Skywalker can also reduce the drains of operatives or ISB.  I want to add a Draw Their Fire and/or Battle Plan for drop and drain decks but I didn't have room.  Basically confront your opponent wherever you can and use the interupts to clean up.'
