Strategy: 

B@#$%ically its a standard Ral Ops deck. First I use the Mobilization Points and IAO to get out docking bays for extra generation. Secure Ralltiir, establish Decree and then battle and drain elsewhere. The reason there isn’t a bunch of AT-ST’s in there because I don’t have all that many unique ones. Those do fairly well though. Usually I get some of those down and then deploy walkers with pilots and some other guys. Usually works but I’ve never played in any tournaments so its not experianced agaist a lot of different decks.
