Strategy: '

Note I recently found out that They will be no match cannot intiate duels with Maul strikes, so my new starting is IAO/Secret Plans Mob Points/ YCHF, and Crush the Rebellion. Also, remove the IAO effect from the effects section.




The idea behind this deck is duel with anyone who’s willing and beat their @$$ off. 

There are 25 7-5 destiny in this deck, so tracking the duel wont be hard. The things I am thinking about is starting Phantom Meanace over No Escape, and then toss in a Rune Haako and a Nute for extra retrevial/Power/ and forfiet for the P-59 and 60. Also, I’m ur dad, and  Mostly armless I think would work well. The Space in this deck is mostly protection once I find a Security Precation. The Lightsaber Combat Obj. doesnt scare this deck mostly because with so many Jedi, it shouldnt be that hard to have a chance to win the combat. The generation is good with about 10-15 by early mid game assuming Vader doesn’t get placed out of play early, which could easily mess this deck, so be careful. Also, Mara Jade is a good idea because she can duel Luke, w/o worring about getting dueled herself.  Also, U-3P0 isnt scared because he cant get ’messed’ if they are using the Epic Event. 

The epic event doesnt really affect anything because anyone w/ minor tracking skills can do w/o it. Also It is extremely easy to hit characters w/ this deck, so if you can battle, you can take on anything. R3... who needs it?


Now, on the the Match- ups.


MWYHL


Doesn’t scare me at all.  First of all, if they are only testing to 5, then Luke just gets dueled by Vader and with a focused attack to pretty much guarantee it, even against a 14 Destiny or you could just hack him down.  If its Leia, go for the hack. (On a side note, I always get a kick out of drawing a 13 weapon destiny with Maul and Vader. 


RST


This is a popular deck in my region, so I know I can beat it.  One reason is the inclusion of multipe LSJKs in RSTs due to his ’Scout-ness’(Another Side Note I’ve  LSJK never lost a duel with ol’ LSJK, even w/ the subraction of 3.  Also, usually with RSTs, after the Bunker Boom, they spread out.  This is asking for it.  One of my most favorite things to do is You are Beaten someone, 1-2 more out with the Lightsaber, Dr E and Boba combo, get thier soup eaten. and Focusing Vader to make him power 12-13 


Hidden Base


This deck just cant handle the direct damage of this deck with Visage and  S&D. Also, the mains that these decks usually include, are duelable, which makes it all the easier...


These are the only decks I know the matchup well. If you have any questions about any other matchups, D-mail me or E-mail me at SIAH87@aol.com


Thanks for your time and Review
