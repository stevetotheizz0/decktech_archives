Strategy: '

First Off, Thanks to everyone for the positive feedback on my original posting.  The deck is performing better, now if only I could play smarter.

I’ll address a few things
Bog Clearing... I don’t own one, I can’t find one, so I’m not playing one... unfortunate, but that’s the way it is for me -(
I find the deck functions well with just 4 Dagobah locations, as long as you recognize the order they should come out in.  Get them down in this order (placement wise).  Hut/Jungle/Training Area/Swamp, Test 1 is done on either the Hut or the Training Area (assuming that Jungle isn’t out) Test 2 should be placed on the Jungle, that way you can finish test 3 fast and deploy test 4 the next turn.

One thing that I’m slowly learning about this deck, is that once you have finished test 3 GO PICK A FIGHT.

I’m not sure what else to say, again if you have any advice, feel free to offer it, as this deck is still losing on a fairly regular basis, but I’m not playing it that well I think. '
