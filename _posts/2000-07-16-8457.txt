Strategy: 

Well I think you all know the starting stuff:
Any Methods Necessary, Security Tower, and maybe a Secret Plans when needed as well as any bounter hunter ship.

Im looking for anything to change so dont grade harshly please. i think that by setting up fast and beginning your drain should kill the opponent. And you can hold some sites fairly easy such as the Security Tower, the Dining Room, and once with the Objective flipped if you hold the Carbonite Chamber with a saber i highly doubt that your opponent will want to lose 8 force. Also with Mosep out, your opponent will start losing a lot of force directly from reserve deck.

Dark Deal decks arent very difficult to play, just set up fast, and drain and I know some people don't like that because it takes away from battling. But if anyone see's anything to change please feel free to critique it any way you see fit to make this deck it's best.
