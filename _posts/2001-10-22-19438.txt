Strategy: '

This is a strong, well-rounded deck (I think I said that before) that should be able
to beat anybody. Suggestions are welcome, but PLEASE tell me what to take
out to put your suggestions in. Odds are I’ve already thought of it but just couldn’t
find room. Here’s the strategy

v. Hunt Down--You take it to him, don’t let him control the flow of the game. Start
Obi’s Hut and Tosche Station. Cancel Visage with the spies and battle as much
as possible. The 4 dueling cards should protect Ben and Luke and maybe even
win the game for you should he be stupid enough to initiate a duel. Just
remember to leave force for First Strike. This is probably the toughest deck to
beat, but you have the battle advantages. Try to track a SATM destiny for
4-LOM. Oola also could turn the game in your favor, kill Vader and keep him off
the table. Your ablity-4 guys can drain at all those drain-2 sites.

v. Big Blue--Oola him to death. Lockdown central. Drain him out. This deck has a
far superior force drain potential to most mains and toys decks. Sense will take
care of Shocking Revelation (if they even have one, which is unlikely. Possible,
but unlikely).

v. Ops--Harc Seff, Order to Engage, the swoops and the Nabruns(if they don’t
use IAO) will decimate them. Drain at your sites with ability-4 characters and
take your mains to the op planet.

v. ISB-- Order to Engage and the wide variety of characters that can draw destiny, 
along with SATM will win the game. Just gobattle them and drain when possible. 
Oola will help if they’re playing uniques.

v. Anything else--just go battle them to death, or Oola them to death. Oola is the
key card in the deck, enabling a near-complete lockdown, but the deck functions
fine without her.

I use EPP luke over Master Luke because of the weapon, but mainly because 
of Glancing Blow--this card is great dueling protection and 
anti-Vader but requires a lightsaber to use.
