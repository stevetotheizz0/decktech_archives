Strategy: 

I picked Jabba instead of Mighty Jabba Because he makes
Scum immune to Alter and he lets my aliens deploy
-1 to the same location.  4-LOM helps against any
one that hurts your deck (Ben Kenobi, Han w/ Gun,
ect...).  The main reason I have Chall in is to
have when I play against Profit, I can pull the
Engineer.  The Engineer raises the Chamber when I
play Profit or any deck that converts my chamber.
If I don’t play Profit, I just sit him at Docking
Bay and drain for +1.  U-3PO helps when I play a
deck where they are draining for a lot, but I don’t
want to go there.  Dr. Evazan kills a Disarmed person
or anyone I hit with a weapon.	Boba Fett and Jodo
Kast hurt the opponent with Hidden Weapons.  Dannik
Jerriko helps against Profit, I search for him
after I convert my Chamber.  Dengar helps with
Evazan because if I hit the two characters, they
both die.  Bib helps against low ability characters
and Ephant helps with Jabba.

I have in Boba Fett, Dengar, and IG-88 in their
ships because if I am playing an all space deck,
any of the three with their weapons won’t help me.
If I am playing an all ground deck, I stick Zuckuss
and Bossk out at Carida to help me with Battle
Plan.

Elis Helrot helps me when I need reinforcements
at a site or I just need to move around.  Projectie
helps when the opponent battles, but doesn’t have
any force left.  The Barriers save me when they
drop a character and I don’t have a lot of defense.
I have in Point Man to mostly cancel Order To Engage
It saves me when they drop that at the Chamber
when they have out Bo Shuda.  If I don’t have
Ephant at the Chamber, and they deploy Boushh, I
use Hutt Smooch.  Sniper is good when you have
a big beatdown planned and you shoot one of their
characters and screw them even harder.	Hidden
Weapons is also one of the interrupts that can
screw the opponent.  It can take out a big
character when you could be beaten.

Come Here You Big Coward! and Search and Destroy
are big against MWYHL. SAD makes them come to you
or lose one a turn and CHYBC also makes them come
to you or they won’t retrieve.  Power helps if
you want more force, search for Ephant and put
him at the Executor docking bay.  Disarmed kills
Han w/ Gun, LSJK if he has his lightsaber, or
any one who has a weapon.  Mob. Points helps with
the terrible activation.  Oppresive and There is
No Try protect my effects and interrupts from
being cancelled.  Resistance helps when I play EBO
or a numbers deck.


Against Profit: I start Mob. Points, Power, and
Secret Plans.  I start Jabba and Chall to pull
the Cloud City Engineer.  I deploy the Engineer
and convert my chamber.  I deploy Ephant Mon with
Power.	Next, I search for Jerriko and Bib.  I
defeat any forces they send to the chamber and
since they can’t force drain on Tatooine, the
weight is on their shoulders.

Against MWYHL:	Start same as against Profit.  The
first Twi’lek I get I search for Search and Destroy
and setup that.  Combinied with the lose from the
Objective, my drains and SAD, they will fall.
easily.  When they flip, I just use my interrupts
to hurt their few characters.

Against EBO: Start Resistance, Mob. Points , and
the last one depends.  I setup the drains on
Tatooine and invade their characters with what
I have.  I use my starships to take out their
ships.	Use SAD and with the Objective, they will
fall.

Against Agents:  Power, Mob. Points, and the last
depends.  Kill their agent and try not to let them
beat you dowm.	Setup your drain at Carida, and
any where you can.  Use Point Man if they play
Order To Engage.  If they play Bo Shuda, Sniper
to shoot down their agent.

Against TIGIH:	Start Power, Mob. Points, and Secret
Plans.	If I deploy Mara, I deploy her a far away
from Luke.  Kill him with 4-LOM, Hidden Weapons,
and disarmed.  Then drain them out.

Please read my deck and stragety before rating.
Don’t give me four stars and say looks good.  Give
me comments about what you think.
