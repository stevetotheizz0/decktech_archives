I did It!   

Strategy: 

this deck is totally weird and plays with one of the most hated cards Jar-Jar binks.

But there is a method in my weirdness.

using jar jar to take out the driods and taking him back into my hand by the way of give me a lift.

that way i can use him for forfeit and keep reusing him again.. and if i track destinies with naked 3po i`ll be able to take out a keep card plus with dipo in the jedi chamber i`ll be able to ensure that i get who i want away.

also panka with blaster plaster is so tech. Mace |@ jedi chamber| with padme in the generator room is 2 direct damage.. which i like alot props to hjedi for that. plus the fact that padme can`t be targeted with weapon due to the jedi present.

jedi chamber with Speak With the Jedi Council  then yoda download there plus more for the other jedis.

now for against other deck types in ep1

wattos sh1t hole
ermm well lose 2 first turn regardless.
then beat him up. try and get panka w/gun and jar jar binks there... that way you`ll be able to take away watto and put him in the graveyard every time. drain on naboo. watch out for mauls appearance there.

senate. they own the senate just jump to his locations apart from GS. and jar=jar bink them away.

R3 objective

will be tough but keep in there.. you`ll be able to track and look at opponents card.. try and get maul OOP.. then you own your opponent the whole game.

help could be pushed my way people... thanks again for reading abusing my decks.....
