Strategy: '

First off Mad Props to Bastian and Martin Akkesson


One thing, if your afraid of Artoo, BLD, than take out something (I suggest Monnok) for a Control/Set For Stun (so your droid has no ability?  Then I’ll send him to your hand and Lateral Damage your Outrider).


Just set up the Occupation and Fighters Coming In at Tatooine, strong guys at docking bays with Reacting At-Sts and Tallon Roll or Blast away your opponents starships.  Use your undercover spies to slow the other guys drains.  Like I said, doesn’t always win by much, but nearly always wins.  One other things, your destiny average is great, being over three.


ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOUR FIRST GAME ACTION SHOULD BE TO PULL CARIDA WITH MOB POINTS


Good luck with it


Me, Myself and I


P.S. If you think the strategy section is too short, let me tell you there is not much else to say.  You play the same against every deck and there’s no hidden tech or combos to be explained. '
