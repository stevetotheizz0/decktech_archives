STRATEGY


		Alright this deck had done fairly well in tournament play, and my meta-area is quite unpredictable, and in that any deck around here that does well is respectable. So , heres the step by step game chronology.


STEP BY STEP


		Beginning of Game- The name of the game is analysis. Find out what he or she is playing an plan accordingly. If the deck is going to be focused on another planet and you think you can overpower him I if he has a weak character base or relies on non-uniques) go for it. If he has a deck based on Naboo, or a deck with a potential of placing a Naboo site down, sit and drain til he comes.



		Mid Game- Ok. By this time you should be draining In a normal game, and he will have to react. The most common reaction to this is Dark Jedi. Great. The plan is this. You deploy Qui and Obi to your sites. Stack sevens.They deploy. You cancel or barrier anything that comes. You combate on the same move phase. They lose huge and no DJs. This strat WORKS. Use it well however, call any skill you have in play. 


		End of Game- By this Time you probably have uncontested control of the Naboo sites, so drain at will. If worse comes to worse and your losing big in the drain game, Revo the core if theres no chance of any battle there soon. Drain and battle anything left that comes out.

                               CARD CHOICE


		EPP Luke- Good since hes a great overall character, and can battle when your flipped


		Its a Trap/Blast/Barrier- use these cards to the best of their ability for escape.


		Sense/Recoil in Fear- ya gotta have a little SAC, and the recoil can help if you get a crappy @#$% hand.


		Revolution- a very VERY versatile card, use it wisely.


		Lost in the Wilderness- underestimated heavily. I once out Xizor missing 2nd turn in a Black Sun Deck, they never found him.


		Naked Threepio- Use him to put back stuff ya dont need, grab stuff you do.



CONCLUSION


		Overall, the deck works if you can play it right. So, Utilize the text of ever card involved, avoid battles until YOU are ready, and always remember what your cards do. These kind of problems usually originate through little things like forgetting to retrieve after reflipping and stuff like that. Always remember stuff and good luck.
