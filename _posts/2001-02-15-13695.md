Strategy: '

Here is a basic Hidden base retrieval deck. 

Start with 


Hidden Base *(Tatooine) 

HFTMF 

Insurrection 

Squadron Assignments 

Do, or do not/Wise Advice (Mains and Toys) OR Menace Fades (Decks that drain) 


Start by deploying Dagobah, Dagobah Yoda&#8217;s Hutt, and the tatooine Docking bay. Use the signals and Tunnel visions to get Tatooine celebration out. 


You should be able to hold Tatooine with the space in the deck. I&#8217;ll take the leader helps to drain at the two docking bays. Set up shop there with Luke and Obi and drain away at those sites while retrieving force for the celebration. 


Owen and Beru are there because they are a power 4, ability 3, get their own destiny, destiny 3, deploy 3, and forfeit 5. Not to mention that if they are lost, Luke is now power of 12 (14 with stick). 


Free Ride is a Used 5 that lets me look at one card in the opponent&#8217;s hand. 


R-3PO and Corran Take care of Undercover Spies. 


Red 6 is a destiny of 6, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s here. Not to mention that it can become immune to attrition < 4 with I&#8217;ll take the leader. 


During the control Phase, do the Cantina shuffle between that cantina and Mos Eisley before draining and retrieving. 


Never, ever lose to Visage from the reserve deck until Tatooine and celebration is either in your hand or on the table. If you lose those two cards, its over. 


I think that&#8217;s all.
