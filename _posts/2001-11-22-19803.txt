The deck i used at FreedomCon to win it.
It lost Game 1 to Matt Bertas Huntdown, only to win the next 6 games.

Matt played Huntdown, which is a pretty bad matchup although certainly not an auto-loss.
Against everything else you definitely have a good shot.
No deck can win against everything these days.

Mad props to Fabien Jacques for convincing me to add Alternatives to fighting.
That card is huge
