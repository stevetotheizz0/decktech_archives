Strategy: '

This deck does not look like much, but it is pretty effective against all court decks.

All My urchins is in there to make your oppent lose 2 force to battle you.  Order engage is in there to make them battle you.  Narrow Escape is in there to run from thoes battles.  So know matter what your oppent will lose force

You will also want to use Narrow Escape to run away from boba fett and Jodo kast or what ever his name is, because they will use that Hidden weapons on you and capture one of your guys.  And in most situations they will have IG-88 there too.  So use disarmed on him so he can’t use his gun on you and take your guys away from you.

There is also a lot of high destiny’s in the deck which help with lando’s axe abilty.  You can usually take out there highest abilith guy with it, go for boba fett or jodo or IG-88 if dont have a narrow escape, disarmed, or all my urchins and order to engage set up.

I Like to have Ben in here rather then obi w/stick, because he seems to stay around a lot longer, and that help.

I Started with Squarden Assignments just so I can get out wedge in a hurry.  You can also get out luke with it too.  Wise Advise is there so sence and alter dont rune the game for you.  You probly dont have to start with Do or Do not,  Probaly want to start with the light side version of secert plans.

Well there is there is the low down on this deck.
I know it could use A LOT of improvements, so just give me some sugestions, I am up for any thing.
Thanks
