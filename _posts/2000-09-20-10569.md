Strategy: '

Ahhh, Eloms. Aren’t they fun? The idea of this deck is to smack the piss out of the damn empire, and if you win a game along the line, so much the better. The basic idea is to get out Tessek and Tanus at the Audience Chamber, and get out the Bacta Tank. Then just plop a couple Eloms at DBs for drains, or save them up for a beatdown. Anyway, let me know what you think. Does it need more Eloms? Less space? I know Court might give it a problem, but Court isn’t too prevalent in my area. '
