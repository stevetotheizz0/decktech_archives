Strategy: '

NOTE If this posts under the Ep1 format, sorry, I didn’t press the EP1 only format on my other decks, but they somehow got posted under it, and if this does, Sorry, but I did not press that button. {SORRY XZILEN}.


From the Third Version, I noticed a very DEADLY error, I did not include the Training Area, which allows me to pull the Test 1 {and theres no other way}.


So, I decided to add that, so the deck works.


Deck Match-Ups


**Podracing**

Just laugh at your opponent for wasting the space. Because, 1, you will probably lose no more then 4 force from the Event, due to A Close Race, the shield. And, hopefully you should have a It Could Be Worse in your hand to lessen the force even-more-so.


**Senate**

Senate gives this deck a little trouble {especially Yeb Yeb, the Senator}. You must rely on minimizing your open spaces for them to pound on you with their drop Mains {ie. Maul, Vader, 4-Lom, Ref3 Fett, Blizzard 4, etc.} Just let the opponent try and occupy the sites, and drop your undercover spies to block em. You should be able to hold them at bay for the most part. 


**Bring Him Before Me**

Make sure you get out Honor of a Jedi to try and cope with Your Destiny, OR, get Luke out as fast as possible and give him over to Sir Vadserlot, and have the opponent lose a force per turn. Watch out for the Back Door first turn with the Emperor and Janus. Thats where a Vergence in the Force comes in handy. You take the drain for one turn, and then ya drop it, and lose only 1 force for remainder of game. 


That should cover most of the match-ups that I will face at the tournament Tommorrow at TWILIGHT GAMES in PENNSYLVANIA, if ya wanna go to it, ya need 4 can goods and 5$ {its a Chase the Cans tournament}. Winner gets a half box of Theed Palace, or something like this. 


If you’d like to go, drop me a D-mail before 100PM EST and I’ll give you directions {if you live in PA I should be able to help you, if ya live outside PA I will have trouble}.


Possible card Add-Ins

Lost In the Wilderness x3

--- This card is T3CH It is such a good canceler to drains, its like a BETTER version of Suprise Assault. If you think I should add it in, tell me what I should take out for it, and give me good, 100% honest REASONS why. Thanxs.


Use Strike Planning to get Crix, and use Jedi Test 1 to deploy Crix, and use the objective to deploy Yoda. Use Dagobah to deploy Yoda&#8217;s Hut first, and use Insurrection to deploy Home One DB also. This will give you a good amount of activation for the next turn. 




The following cards stop drains 

Jedi Test 1 

Honor of a Jedi 

Menace Fades 

PoaS x2 {Projection of a Skywalker} 

Battle Plan {shield} {increases the force needed to drain by 3} 

Wars Do Not Make One Great {increases the force needed to drain by 1} 

A Vergence in the Force x3 

It Could Be Worse x5 

A Gift 

TK-422 

Boush 

Falcon with Claw-Attached 

Artoo-With A Gift {he&#8217;s then an undercover spy} 



Cards that help you get Threepio/Seeking an Audience out 

Control / Tunnel Vision 

Hiding in the Garbage 


Cards that help you stay afloat 

We&#8217;re Doomed x3 

Neck and Neck 


Both of these cards, when we run low on force, help us jump right back up. 


Hey, Dengar69, give me some GOOD info when ya review this deck ya crazy......


Here&#8217;s my 4th version. I will try and post version 5.0 tommorrow, where it involves a QMC start instead of a Mind What You Have Learned start. If You have checked out all of my Droid decks so far, please tell me which one is the best, so I can use it for the tournament this Saturday.  '
