Strategy: 

this deck is pretty self explanatory.  i'm sure it works really well against the new dark side objective.	anyway, i really like the corporal midge and han combo.  At the back door its a drain of 3-4 if u have leia with her stick.  You can also slap a blaster on midge and get major weapon destiny draws.  I absolutely love major panno.  in this deck he's nice cuz u get an extra force generation of 4, plus two more at any site luke is.  Basically just spread thin using all the scouts and also spread thin is space, The space portion isnt that strong but maybe someone could help on that.
