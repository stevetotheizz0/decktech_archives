Strategy: '

  Get out the Dagobah sites for force generation, and Yoda at Yoda's Hut.  Then use the MWYHL game text to deploy Luke's Backpack on Yoda (yes, you can do this).	Play The Signal to get Encampment and put an ASP-707 droid at the Hut with the muppet.	This lets you get a 6 destiny card on top of the Reserve Deck any time you need it.

  Needless to say, not even Vader is safe at this point.  Use all the good battle cards in here to control the five Cloud City sites and Pucumir to add to your force drains.  Then when the opponent is cornered, start playing On The Edge and Off The Edge and retrieve your entire Lost Pile.

  Little bit o' old school, little bit o' new.  Some tech, some brute force.	Some drains, some damage, and vast retrieval.  I think you'll enjoy yourself, but the opponent might not be amused. '
