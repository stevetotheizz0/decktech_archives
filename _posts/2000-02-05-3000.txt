Strategy: 

This is the first attempt and the first version of this deck, so don't be too hard and be constructive please.

This is a drain/battle deck.
But the most interesting part is the followong : opponent must come to you.
If not, you'll drain him with Dark Deal and cause lot of damage with CC Occupation.
So he must come, and you can fight him 'at home'.

Start with Secret Plans and Oppressive Enforcement. With Alters and the 2 stacks, you'll counter Senses, nasty interrupts et cancel most of light effects.
Try to get the other effects as soon as possible, and put your Deal.
Defend the Deal with Walkers, the reacting ability is awesome !

When your Deal is activated, you can let an alien with abiltiy 4 alone. He's often power +4, or 6. And you can react with others walkers... Huge.
