Strategy: '

I don’t know what to write for strategy, it’s QMC, you’ve all seen it an probably played it. Whatever. Do this Play slow, you have control of the game if you flip. Always go to space first, yes you will lose early in the game, but set up in space anyway, even if you have EPP Luke, EPP Obi and two Resiliences in your hand. Why? If you have a solid hold on the system you can spend mid-game taking over the ground as opposed to trying to take ground and space. Once you control the system, flip and Celebrate, Menace, and Battle Plan. From here grab whatever you need EVERY turn, and you should cruise to victory. Some tricks to try 

POLR + SATM/Run from people. 

CC Celebration + Off the Edge + Keeping TEOF

CC Celebration + SATM + Keeping TEOF

CC Celebration + POLR + SATM + Keeping TEOF


See a pattern here? See how you can control the game? Okay then.


BTW Visored Vision is for getting rid of any of the following hurtful cards

Masterful Move/Endor Occupation

Squabbling Delegates

Defensive Fire

I Have You Now

Maul Strikes

Whatever else.


That’s alll, QMC is good, this deck is good. What do you think?
