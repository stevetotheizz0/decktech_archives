Strategy: '

UPDATE  I was thinking last night and a better choice than the 2 As Good as Gones, 2 Rycar Ryjerds, and the 2 I’m Here to Rescue You and put in Wise Advise, There is No Try(use both cards for higher destiny) 2 more Inconsequential Barriers and probably 2 Obiwanw/stick(or Quigon w/stick if you’ve got him).  Then try to take out something for a Resilence or 2.  If you want to you can switch leia out for P2187 but the gimmick of the deck was the flip without being able to flip back.  

This deck is a meta choice.  If big blue space isn’t popular in your area, play this deck.  If BHBM is popular in your area, then put in another Droid Shutdown. Once you pull I did it, your average destiny is 4.6.

Card Choices

Elom-destiny 4, make themselves spies to free their beauty queen

Swing and a Miss-cancels Dark Strike(props to Mark Fessler) and Focused Attack

It’s a Trap-Cancels Sniper and Blasted Droid

As Good as Gone and Rycar Ryjerd-the only time the princess is on the table is when she’s a captive(props to James Barrett)

Lost in the Wilderness-Vader draining at a site alone, tell him to take a walk in the park


Against Huntdown(podracing) win the race, free Leia let them Duel Luke, cancel Focused with Swing and a Miss.  Laugh at them. Tell them you will spit on their grave.


Against Senate watch your hand size carfully,  pop numbers and AFA often.  Play smart.  If you want to near the end of the game remember that Leia is Politics 2 and adds a battle destiny.  Win the Podrace.


Against DSII, Endor Ops and Maul Mains play your game pop numbers and AFA.  Against speed deal start Battle plan instead of Echo Base Garrison.  Pop inserts.  


This deck is versatile even against space.  Throw in a We’re Doomed or 2.  Againsts Monkey Ties throw in a few Surprise Assaults.  Heck, A Vergence in the Force would also help against space and Senate.

Try this deck out it ain’t your mama’s RTP.  '
