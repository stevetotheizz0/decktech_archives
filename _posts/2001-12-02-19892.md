Strategy: '

I played a version of this that wasn’t as good (original was made at 5am on day 2, after 1 hr sleep over 3 days) and HDADTJ SOLID that hayes posted. Got me into the final 8 - the HD was the mistake (if you can call that beauty such a thing), and this LS carried me into the top 8.


DECK UPDATE #1 this deck does not lose to ties. I played against mike merletto who was using probably one of the best tie decks out there, and even tho i am a scrub and forot I did it every single turn, i still won by 12-14 something like that. TIES are BAD agaisnt combat. find a decent player and ask him to make a tourny combat deck. he will beat you 3/4 of the time if not all the time. Ties are simply not good against combat...thats all

********************************************************

Update #2 to Gsiva....Go rape sheep or whatever.

********************************************************

update #3 the ”new” labelled cards are as follows


”new” Quiggy = Quigon, Master Of The Force (reflections 3)


”new” Lando = Lando Calrissian, Scoundrel (reflections 3)


”new Yoda = the Yoda from Reflections 3

*********************************************************

update #4 Tie bombers are not an issue either. After much thought, I do not think that Tie Bombers, most commonly found in Endor Ops, is a viable tournament deck. Simply put, QMC and WYS both have better space segments, and you must have the bomber in control of the system during your control phase not a reality in a big competition. However, if you will look at my defenseive shields, you will notice that i had previously acknowledged Bombers as being bad in that i need my interior sites. Thus, I play with planetary defenses. I pick one interior site to not be bombed, then move my jedi to there. The bomber may collapse one site, but not both, so i will continue draining, will have my characters for odds and combat, win the race, drain at oyur sites, retrieve, and eventually get the falcon in the air. The falcon is near impervious to tie decks. Beggar and I did it force them to lose force or have no force pile to shoot my ship, sense (even if i lose 2, no biggie) takes care of barrier/projective telepathy/command. Plus, life debt should clear whatever ships there are out. trust me, ties lose to combat on a regular basis, but especially to this combat.  -fin

PROPS

Ben Young, for thinking of putting in numbers, loaning me cards, and being bad ass


ALAN SAGAN bad assest canadian EVER, helped to make this deck the beast it is today


suggestions

if you have any suggestions of 2 cards to drop, the deck needs another on the edge and another jedi luke. The deck could also use a Blaster Deflection or a Sando Aqua Monster thanks to all the colo claw fish tech out there...

List of shields


[DDTA, He can go about his business, only jedi have that weapon, grabber, battle plan, ou nee ta, aim high, wise advice, planetary defenses, and ultimatum.]




Ok, here goes the strategery, and PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE REVIEWING If you don’t understand the deck, IM me or something.


This is a revised version of the deck I played that got me into the top 8 at freedom con.


OK, here’s the gist of the deck make your opponent play defensive shields, retrieve, cause damage (Lots and lots of direct damage) and do massive beats. Sound good? It is )


Tech


--High destiny high destiny is always tech )


--Yoda + lando at one site, quiggy + luke or just luke at another. They drop to beat yoda and lando (cause luke has a stick and is sending people to the used pile), make lando big power with his gametext, run luke run, jedi presence, get around 50 power, and at least 2 destinys (you get 2 more if you play Gift of the mentor).


--beggar even if they know the premise of the deck, to draw out shields, they may be hard pressed to pull a shield for beggar. but if they do, mission accomplished. If not, you get an uber turn of deployment


--Lando + run luke run while your jedi cannot initiate while you are flipped, lando can. Just initiate with lando, then run Luke over to help the fight.


--DDTA shield the meta here favors the mob points combo greatly, so by suspending mob points, you get to insert, and they cannot pull the shield, as YCHF is unique and already on table.


--Eject Eject Your space’s only weakness is 1)Imperial command, and 2) Zuckuss in MH. Sense takes care of one, and eject eject takes care of the other. Some may say that guri is also an issue. Basically, you never leave the falcon at a system, you always let it die to attrition in battle (you can forgo immunity) after a beat down. Guri will more likely be used on the ground anyway, but you must play smart


--OTE tech for DS saber combat. they cannot battle you, so they lose a lot of force. It makes up for you losing combat by not having any 7’s.


--NO 7’s this allows you to blind kill your own character with edge, with no risk. It also allows you to sense and alter EVERYTHING unless you play against HD, which your OBJ kills anyways.


--racing and I did It these each get so many shields, its nuts. They literally can use up all the opponents shields. Example you are at 23 for the race total. You draw a destiny, just putting you over the total. during their move phase, they play secret plans shield. so you play Step, and the race waits. You save forece, but only have one battleground. They play CHYBC shield. You step, then get the BG. You win the race, then play I did it, luring out the last shield.


--SAC can take up 3 shields against some decks Do Or Do Not, the grabber, and Oppressive Enforcement.


--The objective gives you force drain locations begging for battle order. cancels dark jedi dependant drain decks. Forces the opponent to react to your game, generally.


--Goo Nee Tay You give up icons, and the best way to beat the deck is to beat it down fast, so Goo is a no brainer


--Free Ride combo cancels occupation, annoys the opponent by looking at their hand, tempting them to get the grabber shield


--OOC combo all the things that cancel OOC/TT are sense-able. Works well with combat, as you kill their characters then try to OOC them. Tempts the opponent to get the grabber shield.


--We Wish To Board At Once x2 pulls itself You can play it to get the copy out of your deck, using it every single turn, alowing you to check where cards are you need without letting the opponent verify.


--Caldera Ringham if the opponent is smart, they will take over one site with a vengeance, meaning x3 dark jedi + lots of backup. Read Hayes’HDADTJ SOLID account of LS combat and how to beat it for more detail. Basically, after they have a ton of guys, drop caldera to the site to block the drain, drop OTE after their shields are used up to do 3 damage a turn, and move a jedi in behind him to combat thier characters safely. Sense kills Forc Lightning, and also kills sniper, as do Strike Blocked and Its A Trap Newest tech, but it works like a charm. Thinking of adding another one in.


--Sense combo as much grabbing of cards as most decks do these days, a well timed recoil can drasticaly mess up the opponent. Also useful in popping Odds


--Never Tell Me The Odds after they have gotten all their shields, you should be set up with luke, lando and yoda on the table. These characters provide 15 for your Odds total. most players don’t use the card YCHF, only the shield, so after they have their 3, its game over


--new quiggy ultimate beatdown character against most decks that drain or have beats, as his gametext can’t be cancelled, and he gets a stick by himself. Also good if they pulled the odds shield or messed that up as it causes 4 force loss after winning combat.


--Only Jedi Carry That Weapon pull this against a good player who is using weapons, and chances are they will pull theirs too. After all, why would you suddenly pull the anti weapon levitation shield unless you just drew a weapon levitation of your own?


--Han Chewie, and the falcon many people do not like this card, as it has high upkeep. However, with odds as a possibility, and a card space limitation, this is ideal for space. Also, Life debt can grab it or make it a powerhouse that draws 4 destiny. Command should be no problem, as you have sense. Only real concern is against huntdown, so be careful.


Ideally, you should get yoda down early to drain. However, there have been many times where you have to drop the pretense of Combat in favor of beating the smack out of the opponent. All your non-yoda characters are ideal for this. Also, thanks to your retrieval, you should be okwith only 11 characters. Trust me, they stick around most of the time for the entire game. The deck is very flexible, and plays similarly to Pod-profit. The added bonuses are, however, that it is not weak like profit is in the area of early damage. Profit always runs the risk of not flipping, whereas you don’t want to flip. 


I can’t give all the strategy for a felexibel deck like this versus all the other dekcs out there. Basically its like I said at the top, you can beat them up, you can do massive damage, you can retrieve massively (especially with ”free” edges...thanks to their shields being tied up), can drain, and most importantly, can surprise the opponent and force them to react to your game plan. 


Enjoy, and cheers
