Strategy: 

the main strategy of this deck is, if the opponent deploys stuff to ground, you go and beat it up, or you can drain in space for quite a bit, presence of the force and mara jade acts as your spies, you can sit the emperor and janus down at the docking bay and have a drain of 2, more with presence of the force and you can`t be beaten up. you`ve got stormtrooper garrisons that with trooper assault they are power 10 each and dark jedi presence makes it power 20 each, which is massive power and kir kanos is power 10 with dark jedi presence. this deck does do massive battle damage when you beatdwon at the right time.
