Strategy Edit

OK in response to reviews, I am playing DS2 Wedge. Also, Take out Ben Kenobi and Tat. DB for another MotF and Queen’s Royal Starship. Drop the Naboo Swamp for Ric Olie, and drop both Signals for We Wish to Board at Once, and Reveal Ourselves to the Jedi (about the techest card you can find)


This won’t be a very long strat, so if you want longer strategy, go look at my other Naboo Celebration deck on my page, and substitue anywhere it says Gungans for mains. Thanks

Anyway, there is one thing I need to say for strategy with the mains type. Against space use Cap’n Han for the Falcon instead of on the ground. Also use Chewie and Leia mebbe for a superfalcon. If space is popular in your area then add Punch It for something, mebbe a Might of the Republic, or A Vergence in the Force. Thanks for reading and reviewing, and like I said in my earlier deck, She may not look like much, but she’s got it where it counts.

The Future World Champ, Phil
