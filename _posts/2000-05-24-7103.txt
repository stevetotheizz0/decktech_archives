Strategy: 

Start with The Signal and Baraining Table or Insurrection, whitchever you prefer.	Use The Signal to get your other effects out quick.  Use the commandos to control 3 exteirior sites to flip, or if you cant do it that way then the Explosive Charges should let you Destroy the bunker easy.  The rest is self explanatory.
