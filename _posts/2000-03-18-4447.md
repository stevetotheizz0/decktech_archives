Strategy: '

The deck starts with tatooine space and Jabba's Palace to rip Jabba's Aud. for good early activation and easy Occupation.  The deck also gets good early activation with 4 masterfull moves to grab the holotable early and to reduce the need for 0 destiny sites. Then depending on the hand and opponents deck it sets up well deffended drain at any of the locations then sets up tatooine Occupation (removed from the deck with a Twi'lek Advisor).  The rest of the decks plan is simply to use the decent destiny in the deck with weapons and double destiny draws to battle your opponent ethier where they are or off tatooine.  And whenever possible the deck trys to finish with a well placed You are beaten with vader w/lightsaber or Jade w/lightsaber.

Well unfortunatly I have not played many of the top deck types because I live in Maine where most people mostly play fun decks that don't ever include numbers or Operatives (which is why the deck has no numbers protection).

The deck is designed to butcher Profit decks planing to convert thier starting locations and use thier objective to help you set up occupation.  Oh and Look sir droids to kill a gift.

The ship count is so the deck can easly hold tatooine space for enough turns to count against any space deck (Hidden base or otherwise).

Against Mains and toys (most decks in Maine currently) Weapons that hit 50% of the time and Walkers drive them nuts expesialy with Dr. E.  Also most are designed around tatooine so they give you good drain/occupation sites.

Against Training the multiple sorces of force loss holotable, space, ground, presence of the force and occupation out pace the deck and the balacne of the deck gets around Battle Plan.
