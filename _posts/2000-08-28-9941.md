Strategy: '

Start with HFTMF and the 3 effects.  Deploy the Star Cruisers to the Rendezvous Point and move them to where ever.  Get the Special Ed guys on their ships at their respective planets to get some good drains going.  Control Cosruscant to give him a hard time getting his stuff down.  Home One w/ Ackbar, Red Squadron 1 w/ Wedge, Red Squadron 4 w/ Hobbie, Gold Squadron 1 w/ Cal and Nunb, Blue Squadron 5 armed to the teeth w/ Numb OR Liberty w/ a Heavy Turbolaser and anything else that can kill, go around taking care of nuissances in the air while Luke, Solo, Chewie, Leia , and Ben go around doing the same on the ground.  Rebel Leadership really helps this deck by preventing your opponent from drawing more than one Battle Destiny and then cancelling it with Solo or Wedge.  NEVER split up the ground.

	       If you are against...
Rall Ops Get your guys on Ralltiir asap.  Flip your objective to cancel their drains.	Drain in Space.
ISB Get your guys to their base and flip your objective.  Drain in Space.
BHBM Give them Luke asap and play your battles carefully.  When their objective is flipped they lose one Force each turn which is your bonus and if they can't get any cards on Insignificant Rebellion they can't turn Luke.  Drain in Space.
Court Drop your guys at the Audience Chamber and don't get captured, which is very easy to do.  If you do get a guy captured get him/her back.  Drain in Space.
TDIGWATT Drop your guys on Cloud City and kill some people.  Drain in Space.
HDADTJ Keep Luke on the table and keep Vader off it.  Drain in Space.
CCT Let them start with Leia.	Drop your guys at the Carbonite Chamber and get Leia back before they freeze her.  Drain in Space.
Ops Get some guys to the Renegade Planet and kill.  Drain in Space.
Walker Garrison Attack the Walkers.  Drain in Space.
Endor Ops Go to Endor and kill.  Drain in Space.
TIE Swarm Attack their TIE's in great numbers.
#'s Attack their high destiny guys.  Drain in Space.
SYCFA Get some guys on the Death Star and kill.  Drain in Space.
TTO Blow Away DSII asap.  Drain in Space.
Mains Attack their Mains.  Drain in Space.
