**Revision  There are 16 interrupts and 17 characters...Sorry for any confusion.**


Response to reviews  I knew somebody was going to criticize me for too little activation.  I reached this happy medium through playtesting, Captainsolo.  Try it out.  And I don’t need more space, because if you’re examining your force pile, you know when to draw them.  The Virago is some of the ultimate protection for Xizor, and that’s why I play two of it.


*****


This deck is a Tatooine modified Dark Surgeon.  SAC is back, so I play SAC protection, and therefore no SAC.  Anyways you can find to cause your opponent extra damage, or disrupt their game plan are fine in my book.  I also use that start to help me by playing 2 grabbers, which are a disruptive force on their own.  Basically, through Bad Feeling Have I, Broken Concentration, Battle Order, First Strike, Secret Plans, and Projective Telepathy, you force choke your opponent to death.


The first criticism somebody is going to give me is that this deck doesnt generate enough force since Mob Points has been neutralized.  Well, it does seem that way.  But by knowing what cards are in your force pile and also knowing what order they are in, you remove the need to draw large amounts of force.  Instead, you draw specific cards, because you know which ones you need.  Thus, you can save force over a couple of turns, and then deploy.  You dont have a lot of cards to deploy, so this strategy works, and despite the very few force icons this deck has, it still works incredibly well.  Also, by not starting Mob Points or YCHF, your opponent probably wont start Dont Do That Again, so you should be able to sneak a few turns of big activation in before they can suspend it.  Also, PotF can turn Coruscant into a battleground system, thus suspending Dont Do That Again.


Card Choices

Emperor Palpatine x5  Palpy makes the deck.  You deploy him early and he basically holds a site by himself (of course he never minds a little company from 4-LOM, Aurra Sing, or those witty little Vigo.  Hey, hes gotta have somebody to talk to, since everybody always seems to try and avoid him.)  Once hes deployed, you use the 1 card traffic control function to put duplicates of him back in your deck, thus raising the average destiny, and making it possible to kill people like Luke, Obi-Wan, or even Qui-Gon (think 4-LOM or Force Lightning).  Also, one of the biggest things for succeeding with this deck is knowing where to put him.


Projective Telepathy  Your opponent drains, you make them pay 2.  Your opponent battles, you make them pay 2.  If you can turn 10 force into 4 (and believe me its not that hard), youve got a huge advantage over your opponent.


Aurra Sing  A new ability 4 bounty hunter.  Shes better than Djas Puhr, because if you can manage to steal a saber, you can wreck your opponents fighting forces


TiNT & OE  Like I said, SAC is back, so its not in my deck.  Black Sun is a direct damage deck, so if you can make your opponent lose force because of one of their strategies, awesome  Plus, it makes your grabbers deploy for free.


Sebulbas Podracer  Versus a dedicated racer, you wont win the race, but if you dont put a little pressure on Anakin, hell stall at the finish line until winning the race suits his purposes.  If he does that, youre at a huge disadvatage, because suddenly youre playing an opponent with a 76 card deck.  Thats not good.  Put the pressure on, and with a little help from Podracer Collision, you might even win a race or two.


Oh, Switch Off  I havent been able to figure out why, but people dont like 4-LOM, Iggy, or Guri.  This will help keep them around, so you can make a convincing argument in their favorheh heh


This Is Some Rescue  Well, if I were playing against my deck, the first thing that I would try to do is place Xizor out of play.  How would I do that, I wonder.  I might try to get him with Out of Commissionbut I wouldnt be able to if it gets cancelledsay by This Is Some Rescue.


Strategy

The idea is simpleDeny your opponent force.  Use all of the bonuses of the flip side to win battles and cause lots of damage.  You must have a good understanding of what your objective allows you to do, and when it allows you to do it in order to win.  Using your objectives text properly, you should be able to track just about every card through your deck.  Lets seeEmperor Palpatine is the bottom card of my force pile so if I use all of my force, I can activate 8 force next turn and Ill have a 6 and a 3 stacked on the top of my deck.  And I havent even checked any destinies, yet.  Black Sun can dissect any deck out there.


Vs.

WYS Palace Raiders  Start Secret Plans instead of TiNT & OE.  Monnok, No Escape, Monnok, First Strike, Monnok their Raiders away.  Grab their retrieving Interrupts.  Put Palpatine in the Cantina.  Use as many of your starships as you can to take away the system.  If used correctly, each one should add a destiny.  Xizor on the Virago, 4-LOM on the Mist Hunter, Hounds Tooth by itself.  If you get them all down, thats 4 battle destiny.  Not even Ill Take The Leader can save them from that attrition.


WYS Beatdown  Start Secret Plans instead of TiNT & OE.  Have Palpatine and some bounty hunters grab a foothold in the Cantina.  SFS Artoo & Threepio.  Tough, tough match-up.  I wouldnt expect anything less from the number 1 Light Side deck.  But through character removal and smart play, you should be able to hold your own in that inevitable battle and avoid that one turn-beat down.


RST  Deploy the Emperor to the Landing Site.  If theyre blowing up the bunker, control the bunker with tracked destinies and attrition bonuses.  If they cant control the bunker, they cant blow it up.  If they arent blowing up the bunker, youll probably have a little bit of a tougher time.  Close Air Support can be a nuisance, so use your 4 destiny space fleet to take over Endor and let your bounty hunters start rounding up rebels.


EBO  Deploy the Emperor to your docking bay.  Avoid Hoth for fear of Ice Storms.  When the time comes deploy your starships to space to disrupt their drains.  Remember, 4 battle destinies is a lot of space power.  Most of their sites arent battleground sites, so it should be an easy flip for you.  Monnok their X-Wings.


Hidden Base flip  Again, you do a lot of damage early.  That by itself should wreak havoc on your opponent.  Theyre going to have to deploy Luke to a site to flip you back, and if youve done a good job of tracking, you should have no problem capturing him to continue your beatings.  When the time comes, deploy your 4 destiny space fleet to probe and take away their space power.  Could be a tough battle, but youve got the tools to win.  Monnok their X-Wings.


Hidden Mains  Guri in space will be the key.  Take away the super falcon, use your multiple space destinies to kill their Menace Fades and Tatooine Celebration.  SFS Artoo & Threepio if you fear hes going to limit your destinies.  Its Mains vs. your bounty hunters.  Mains match-ups are always tough, but if you play smart, you will win this one.


QMC  Another tough match-up.  Youre first big advantage is going to be that you get a lot of force from your opponent.  Deploy Palpatine to the North Passages to drain and cancel their drains.  Use those destinies to control Bespin and cancel Celebration (dont forget that if you control Bespin, your characters deploy -1).  Grab their Edge cards.  Stop their retrieval, and they wont be able to hold up to the damage.


Profit  Direct damage vs. direct damage.  Which one will win.  Well, if the Emperor controls the Audience Chamber, theyre going to have to rely on somebody who loves you to free Hanbut you get an action between their deploy/move.  Can you say Force Lightning?  If Leia cant get to Han, she cant free him.  If they cant free Han, they cant win.


Tatooine Mains  Theyve just deployed a couple of good drain locations for you, so deploy the Emperor to one of them.  Its another Mains match-up and that means its going to be tough.  Grab Edge cards or Harvests.  Cancel Clash of Sabers with Crush.  Youve got some tricks up your sleeve so use them.  Use your objective to the fullest.  Play it smart and you should emerge victorious.


MWYHL  Wait, does Broken Concentration help against this deck type.  Well, look at that.  It slows down jedi testing.  Start Secret Plans instead of TiNT & OE.  If they test daughter, PotF Coruscant, occupy it with Xizor on the Virago, deploy Broken Concentration to slow down their testing.  If they test luke, its just about an automatic win.  PotF the Executor DB.  Occupy one with the Emperor and one the other with Xizor.  Pay for those drains, because you dont want to run into the super-falcon.  If you can maintain the pressure through the entire game, youre opponent wont be able to retrieve when they complete test 5.  Therefore, you win.  But, dont think that this means you will always win.  Jedi Testing in the hands of a good player can be one of the nastiest LS decks out there.  So, play smart.


Those are all the popular decks I can think of.  If you have any questions, feel free to write me.
