This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time / Pray I Don't Alter It Any Further '

Strategy: '

Alrighty then, Objective starts it off and I pull out my casino and secret plans.  Then in a few turns I should have a couple more sites out and be ready to play sabaac from then on.  I put in power characters without the weapons because I like attrition immunity. Ok, I play sabaac, and fear the LS when I can.  Sleen hits the casino for no deploy attack tactics from the LS.  Hutt smooch gives me time to get ready for a battle.  Expand the Empire allows me to gamble at other locations other than casino if it's taken over.  All the sites are exterior so Tempest 1 can walk around and smash buildings )  It's Worse are in the deck because It Could Have Been Worse is popular in my area.  By playing Sabaac twice a turn the LS should have cards in his Used pile on my turn so then the rarely used Trinto Duaba gets used.  I take the gamble and hope I knock some of his cards out with that.  The Starships take care of the space.	Now I realize there is a deck that can beat this.  Maybe a bunch can but you gotta realize there isn't a perfect deck because the game IS balanced.  Thanks for your time and review. '
