Strategy: '

this deck works on getting large amounts of force fast and then taking it to the light side...

Ok heres how it works the first turn...

Pull emperors power and redili, then during your deploy phase....grap the docking bay and but the empeor there...this gets you a min of 9 force 2nd turn.

from there the deck works just like any beatdown deck...

Decree and BO helps for ebo and x-wings.
The 2/2 drian sites and endor helps for testing.

The deck works well against the new endor light side deck. You can take luck right out of the game and then with a circle take obi out of the game.

Well right now it is still version 1.0, maybe with some reviews the deck can gain so great tech.'
