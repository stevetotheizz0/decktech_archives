Strategy: '

this deck is really hard to play...when you look with hb for a system you have to know every card in your force pile...like this you know if you have to draw or not.

grab gen solo with strike planning.

yoda stew is there so you put back your double and useless card back to your force pile

with tunnel vision and your activation you should get all your 6 adder plus all the card you need to kill your opponent in 4 turn '
