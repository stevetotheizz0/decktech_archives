Ok, well get Vader down as quickly as possible. Begin draining, and battling. Your high destinies should be able to overpower your opponent. I guess I'll go ahead and go into spec. on certain decks:

Speeders:
I'm using only interior sites, to protect myself. Be sure to drain in space.

Numbers:
1 Torture, plus Resistance should be enough.

Profit:
Start Mara Jade and Dr. E. Get Mara's saber down first turn, and you should be able to make them lose one of their characters immediately, (Dr. E operates). Just battle continually, and make sure you have the drain of 2 up in space at Kashyyyk. Destiny, will be the dirfference in a win, or loss.

Ops:
Get ABCTTU out ASAP. Beat down, with your characters.

Revo:
Well I've never seen a Revo deck, in my area, but just in case I've packed one Evader. That should be plenty, with Crush The Rebellion.

Rescue The Princess:
Stop the droid with Restraining Bolt, cancel Cell 2187, with This Is Some Rescue! You can also use This Is Some Rescue! to cancel Im Here To Rescue You! By then, you'll have the objective, flipped, and can move to the Death Star, to just protect the flip of RTP. If they do get it flipped, drain in space, and dont be afraid to battle. You can also use Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down to cancel their key game plan...retreiving with Death Star Plans.

Massassi Base Ops:
Dont help them out, by deploying Death Star. Beat down (the +2 will not hurt too much).


Tech on certain cards:

Blast Door Controls:
Cancels Narrow Escape and Rebel Barrier.

Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down:
Not only cancels Death Star Plans, but also cancels Bacta Tank and How Did We Get Into This Mess.

You Are Beaten:
Cancels Uncontrollable Fury

Cloud City: Incinerator:
You can pay 2 force to retreive IG-88 With Riot Gun, or 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle.

Point Man:
Cancels Order To Engage, Scramble, No Disintegrations, etc.

Well, I guess that's it. Thanks for reading!
