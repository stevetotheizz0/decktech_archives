Edit@@@@@@@ Character Count Should by 24 not 25

This is the First Profit I have ever built, so I dont no all of the deatails on how to play it, but it is pretty simple. Just Free Han, Get You Eloms and Mains out. Drain for tons, and retrieve with the Wind Chimes. If they come down destroy them in battles and you can win

More Strategy will be added, after I find the time to play test thid deck a few times.
