Strategy: '

Okay, so you&#8217;ve already seen several dozen of these decks, well I&#8217;ve got another one for you.
	I obviously start with the power generators and a new secret base.  I get EBO set up as quickly as possible.  If I can get Princess Organa out at the beginning I am in great shape.  I can then pull evram, wedge, and reflection.  I pull echo base garrison and pull out hobbie, commander luke, zev, and wedge if he&#8217;s still in the deck.  I can then set up with my starships very quickly.  With insurrection I don&#8217;t have to worry about losing starships, my pilots have forfeit of 6+.  Put evram on a ship for forfeit of 7.  Mantellian Savrip can also be used to forfeit from hand if necessary.
	 I use On Target to keep any ship I want around for another turn, I can then use stay sharp to blow them away; another option on this card is to keep a starship from drawing battle destiny.  If I have luke and dack at the same place, especially if luke is on red 5 with x-wing cannons, even fett in slave 1 can&#8217;t hide.  Wedge and Wes can be used for the same combo in a corvette or falcon.  Direct assault can be used against those annoying ships with immunity to attrition, for example, I can take out the executor without much trouble, I simply direct assault and draw destiny.
	The bacta tank is great for recirculating pilots.  If it gets cancelled, it goes to the used pile by wise advice, and I can pull it back out the next turn.  The Leia&#8217;s are great for either retrieving with reflection, or forfeit fodder.
	With this many pilots and this much great forfeit, it doesn&#8217;t take more than one, maybe two ships to hold a system and drain away.  I can quickly kill my opponent with my massive drains.  The lack of a huge number of starships is offset by the fact that I can forfeit continually without ever losing a ship.
	My mains and high-forfeit characters should be able to battle my opponent anywhere but their strongest points.	Even in those positions I could hold my own with the same forfeit that allowed me to hold space.
