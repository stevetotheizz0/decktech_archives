oops senator palpatine not senator valorum
start coruscant and senate and deploy the home 1 docking bay and then the coruscant docking bay the main idea of this deck is to use the senators and their bonuses to get some good drains at coruscant and a touch of retreival this deck is pretty new and hasnt been played alot please offer some constructive suggestions and if you tell me something to add then tell me what you would take out thanks alot  '
