Strategy: 

TURN 1:
drop down omnnious rumors on turn one. with a biker scout with a bike to endor landing platform and a hopefully another system with a defender. this will give you a nice drain of 5 on turn 2. at the end of you’re turn use mobilization points to pull executor. 

TURN 2:
with any luck you should now have enough force to drop down executor. at this point if you can get out the back door and the forest clearing. drop down establish secret base. and hold on to 4 sites.
1. sullust
2. endor
3. endor:back door
4. endor:forest clearing
those four sites alone will give you a nice drain of 8. that should be all you need to win a drain race.

from this point on reinforce you’re power at those four sites. use blast points to pull blasters. and here is a fun trick. get out seinar fleet systems on wakeelmui. and then lose 1 force to play all power to weapons. this will get thee all power toweapons back along with the force you lost + 1 card. this trick works pretty well. as long as you’re careful you should be able to hold on to those four sites pretty well with this deck.
