Use Strike Planning to get Crix, and use Jedi Test 1 to deploy Crix, and use the objective to deploy Yoda. Use Dagobah to deploy Yoda’s Hut first, and use Insurrection to deploy Home One DB also. This will give you a good amount of activation for the next turn.

Here’s my 3rd version. I will try and post version 4.0 tommorrow, where it involves a QMC start instead of a Mind What You Have Learned start. If You have checked out all of my Droid decks so far, please tell me which one is the best, so I can use it for the tournament this Saturday. '
