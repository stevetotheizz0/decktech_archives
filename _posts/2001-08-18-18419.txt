Strategy: '

this deck is vry fun to play. 
first of all some of your opponents will be surprised by seing that you are playing imperials in a court deck.

the stategy 
 first turn  start the race pull marajade to the audience except if you have it in hand. pull the docking bay. If you have enough forces you can deploy marajade from hand and pull gailid.

 second turn  begin deplying your heavy personnae 




never forget the force every turn if your opponent doesn’t com to you.

I always start watto’s box except against the watch your step/ podrace then i start allegations of corruption to stack tunnel vision.

use your senses sparely because there are not too much in the deck oh yes i forgot these are old versions sense and alter.

why i use some cards and not others.

court  of the vile gangster in place of MKOS i prefer the direct dammage version and with that i can pull my ships.

p-59 destiny direct dommage immunity what more could you ask for.

this is some rescue  against OOC and its a 6

masterful / occupation  againt the celebrations and because mmantellian savrip.

we must accelerate ou plans  read it.

control / set for stun to cancel a big drain or to sfs a character in a key moment.

neimodian advisor because sometimes tatoine jp doesnt come out

battle order and first strike against first strike.

allegation of corruption its a five and it can be started.

blast door controls because i have lost a big number of games with rebel barrier

mauls sith infiltrator because it can be pulled with the objectif , it can hide from battles ant its a 6.

THis deck went 2/1 in tournament the only loss was against a profit deck were i played like a dumb.
