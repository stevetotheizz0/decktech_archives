Strategy: 

hello everyone!

Well, first off, thank you for taking time to look at (and hopfuly review) my deck.

Well, here is how I play this virsion of Hunt down:

I start off Watto’s box and just podrace away.  Stop little ani for getting his racer started.  Your destinys look like this:
0=4
1=12
2=2
3=3
4=0
5=20
6=1
7=6


Nice little spread don’t ya say?  Well, bump into Anakin until he is right back at the staring line.  Get out sites with you advisor and bring down Vader and maul, waste characters with the droids sitting at the lars mosture farm adding one to each of their weapons destinys.  Sound good?  Ok, I will edit this page more once I have more time.  Later days!
