Strategy: '

The strategy for this deck is simple, Star with Operational as planned to pull the DSII, Desperate counter and Moff Jerjerrod. Use Endor as your starting location and deploy the DSII and desperate counter first turn and use Jerjerrod to look for a DSII Sector. Then each turn after that keep searching for DSII sectors and the DSII Docking bay, then when thats done pull That Things Operational and the Superlaser and then your ready. While doing all that deploy your starships and drain and beat your opponent in space and protect the DSII at all costs once completed. Once your ready to fire the Superlaser, just target a Star Cruiser present or other Capitail Class ship and BANG good bye Rebel ship, I really enjoy doing that in games when my opponent uses Home One and those Strike Planning decks. The only decks I have played where this Deck didn`t do to well were X- wing decks as my opponents had no Capital Class Starships, which made the Superlaser Pointless.  '
