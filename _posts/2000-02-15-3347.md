Strategy: '

As you can see this deck isn't exactly a capture deck, the front side of the objective is fine with me.  It's a straight forward type deck with not many tricks in it.  I was sick of trying to do something 'special' with dark so I made this.  Depending on what they start you can start Security Precautions, Bad Feeling, Crush, or whatever.  If you start with Endor in your hand deploy a starship from your reserve deck (not a capital though).	Against Ops start Battle Order and get Zuckuss's ship out of the reserve deck. Against Revolution decks with mains it will be a hard fought game but if you can keep Scum out you will win.  Against HB use the lose 1 force text and hit them quick from the reserve deck.  Spies won't last long with the protection in the deck.  Have fun '
