Strategy: '

Start with the Flaps to get the advantage in the Clouds.
I prefer a variety of mains with varying uses.	There
are some utility cards for Numbers, etc. although I
will probably be putting in another TT for HuntDown.
Try and get a 1st Turn Flip if the opponent gives you some force.
This is why I start with the Guest Quarters.  An
early Leia for 2 Force with another character and
a ship or Cloud Car at BespinCC provides a quick
flip.  Use the Landing Claw trick with the leaders
to make sure the objective stays flipped.  Garrison the locations
and proceed accordingly.  If you detect no space,
the Celebration can provide some retrieval.
I really want to try and fit in some Paths of Least
Resistance but I have no room.	Any ideas?  I'm
also considering LiF as well.  So far, this
deck is 2-1 in tourney play and has proved itself
to be worthy.  I lost to Huntdown by 5(this is the reason
for the other TT), but beat up on Ralltir Ops and the new EJP Objective.
This deck is easy to play and versatile as well.  '
