Strategy: 

i think im bring this deck back from the dead for my Location. its a basic rattilr deck with tech in it. and hes why i use some of the cards
Why guri? becuse if u put her on the chimaera and the light side draws only one destany in space.
Janus Greejatus? becuse i love tracking and this help ALOT!
4-LOM? becuse i thou him on zuckass in ship and i get one more destiny. which is COOL
why 2 lateral damage? Becuse this card is a game winner. and i like have one in my hand and hey nothing wrong with 2!
battle deployment? this is the best card for rattilr ( at every system where any players dont have a capital and a starfighter that players starships are power -2. at sites related to a system you occupy, during each battle opponent draws more the 1 battle destiny. and once during each of your turn u may deploy a combat vehicle! so i can pull a vehicle and a imperial with my obj. to i can flip on the second or third turn in MOST games. ok thanks for reading
