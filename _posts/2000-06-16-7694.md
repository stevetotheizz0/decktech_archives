Strategy: '

Doh Made a mistake already. One the the Lone Warriors should be replaced by Imperial Arrest Order, which is the decks SE.

The strategy to this deck is fairly simple. At the start of the game you pull all your docking bays to give you more force. Then you just relentlessly pound them with Vader's and Mara's. The lone warriors are in there so Vader and Mara can work indepently. One of the most important parts of the deck is Dannik Jerriko. Three may seem excessive, but when you play him right, you almost always wind up sucking up a couple of their mains. This is good because this removes them from the game, so they're gone permanently. The Omni Boxes are in to punish those people who like to track destinies. when used at the right time, they can be devastating. My friend who plays this deck is incredible at tracking destinies which makes this deck extremely deadly in his hands.

Oh, and please don't give me a lower rating because this is not my deck. I'm not trying to take credit for it in any way. I posted it because my friend who built it doesn't have a computer. '
