Strategy: 

Usually I don't like Ralltiir Ops but this version
works pretty well. It gives massive generation and
tries to go to the opponent and smash whatever
they are doing. One special thing is that it can
actually fight of Liberation Ops on its own planet
which is something very few Ralltiir Ops can do.
AT-ST Pilots are tech and can be brought out with
the objective. The Docking Bays get pulled to
get you some force advantage.

Specs :

HB- Flip with authority. Try to flip with the AT-ST guys and AT-STs and have all available pilots go up into space.  Grab Security Precautions
ASAP. Get the Vader , Vader's Shuttle , and Bus
together after the flip to do some nice damage.
When ECC comes out this deck will add Dengar for
X-Wing Swarm. Lateral Damage and First Strike is
a nasty combo that will probably break the game
open for you.

Ops - Many tech counters. This deck will generate
an insane amount of force very quickly so you
can flip quickly. Get Battle Order up quickly ,
then Bright Center , and then Empire's New Order.
You don't have to stay at a battleground system
so Landing Claw doesn't matter. You don't drain
for anything so it doesn't matter. All you do is
get First Strike and Empire's New Order up and put as many ability 4 combos together as you can
and just keep knocking the ops around , with First
Strike and ENO up you'll be able to keep up with the Op Regen and outlast them. Try not to deploy extra locations because you need to be able to retreive enough available force as possible. If
they are playing Ops on your planet then deploy your extra locations and convert theirs (huge. You can actually fight Ralltiir Ops really tough.
Basically this is like normal Ops but you just need to get Battle Order and Empire's New Order up.

MWYHL- Cave and Failure stop testing pretty cold.
This decks drain potential is kinda weak with 5 which includes 2 for PotF but usually MWYHL try
to interact so they should have something to interact. If they don't then just pull Secret Plans and CBHYBCoward. Whenever something comes
out batter it down. AT-ST pilots offset Test 2
so that is pretty sweet.

M & Toys - All Rebels deploy +2 to Ralltiir and
this deck generates massive force so you'll be
able to out match them in the ability department.
If you flip then they'll have no chance. This deck
can wipe ability off the table like no other.

Enjoy...when Death Star 2 comes out it'll only
become better.
