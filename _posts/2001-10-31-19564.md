Whatre You Tryin to Push On Us


New shields

I know they will hurt a lot but SAC is still huge. Cancelling an interrupt at a key time is great.


Vs Ties

I can win this. Deploy Battle Plan. They block one of your drains, drain at the other 3-4 sites (2 at each). That drain is pretty big. Save up the Super Falcon for late game when they have deployed most of their Ties. You kill their spies with Corran. Against SYCFA drain in their war room. Its a drain race but you can sometimes set up faster. Add Aim High if you want.


I think Ties will decline since Battle Plan is common and Aim High is now a D Shield. Those two cards slow down Ties considerably.


Vs Hunt Down and BHBM

Hmm tough, never actually read the otherside of Tosche Station.. Oops...


-----End update-----

Ok, this is my deck I might use after R3 is released. I first saw a good version of this deck played by Matt Kucklinca and I later got beaten by Sam Diamonds Tosche Station deck by 23 vs my Big Blue deck. Ill run through my card choices..


Locations

Start Obis Hut and Tosche Station most times. Against a scum type deck, start Jabbas Palace if you can convert theirs, that is always huge. The other sites are for drains and activation.


Characters

Obi-wan is obvious and I wanted to be immune to Monnok so I split it to 2/2/1. Ben is good for keeping EPPs around for many turns. The EPP Obi and Lukes can be used with Resilience to perform suicide attacks. Qui-gon holds a site and Corran is anti-spies and is a spy himself. Han, Leia, and Lando are supporting characters if I have to take out a site with several of their mains present. Threepio is a tracking machine and is pretty good for getting needed cards into hand. Padme pulls Obi and Quigon. The monk is for added drains, plus he looks like a spider and I like spiders...


Ships 

The Falcon is pretty good still, if you face space, get it into hand and then drop it with some mains and beatdown their weakest system.


Weapons

Sabers add to my drains - they add up fast. Also a way to take out the Emperor or Maul.


Interrupts

Careful Plannung is an underused starting interrupt and its other function can sometimes help. The SAC is just huge. Even with the bullets out I win games with it. One game someone deployed Lord Vader with Saber against Obi and Luke. I sensed I Have You Now and hit Vader. The battle resulted in 13 overflow damage for him. Gift of the Mentor is to get out sabers and can sometimes add to battle destinies but that is rare nowadays with Guri and Edcel. A Jedis Focus is anti-aliens and I think it does something in duels. Resilience is the ultimate Bacta Tank and I dont think its anti-duel text ever helps much. We Wish To Board At Once is to pull the effects since I start none. Mindful of the Future pulls my sites in case my Tosche Station strategy doesnt activate enough. Nabrun is to move around unrestricted unless they use IAO but even then it can sometimes be useful. Tunnel Vision is great, it helps to set up your hand quickly. It Could Be Worse is my race defense. 


Effects

Goo Nee Tay adds to their guys deploy which is good since I only give away 2-4 icons per game. Bacta Tank with Ben and Resilience are good to make your mains stick around longer. The grabber is to stop any abusive effects. I Hope Shes Alright and the Battle Plan combo care are my space defense. Your Insight is anti-numbers, screw, and helps me hit Jedi since my destinies are low.


Strategy vs decks

Hunt Down, BHBM, other stuff with mains

Set up fast and get Glancing Blow into hand. It helps in duels and can hurt Vader in a big beatdown. Get out Goo Nee Tay and Bacta Tank. SAC goes through thanks to your insanely low destiny.


Mauls mains, Scum, other alien crap

Convert their Jabbas Palace if they start it. Either way they wont get much activation. You can Transmission Terminated The Phantom Menace and you have the SAC to get rid of I Have You Now and Maul Strikes. A Jedis Focus with Qui-gon makes Scum decks weak. 


Space

Get out Battle Plan and I Hope Shes Alright. You drain for 4+ on the ground and can get rid of undercover spies. Alter anything like Dreaded Imperial Starfleet. Spread, drain, win..


Walkers, dark deal, etc

Take the battle there. You have the power and SAC is huge again. Use Battle Plan/DTF to help you. Watch for Ice Storms. Load up the Falcon and attack space, Sense Imperial Commands.


Senate

I hate Senate Get out Battle Plan ASAP. You kill their mains hopefully. Sense Force Field or the Dark Jedi destiny adders. 


Any questions, comments, suggestions ,etc - dmail me.
