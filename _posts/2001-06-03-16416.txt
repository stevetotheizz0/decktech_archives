Strategy: '

A scum deck that uses high destinies and specific cards to beatdown any type of opponent.  The deck usually flips objective 3rd turn  and can hold on for wins all the time.  Profit usually would hurt this deck, so cc enginner and none shall pases were added.  Watch your step can hurt so catchers were added.Worried about them drawing tons of destinies, drop guri, but watch out for jar jar.  Ao/ww is a great card, both sides useful, to cancel a rebels game text or go get a nonunique alien, but if you draw for destiny its a 7, wow.  Use scum and objective to retrieve, and if myo dies he goes back to reserve, thats awesome. I put the podracer in because with high destinys you can usually win, not so much stopping the force lost but preventing them from playing i did it which hurts '
