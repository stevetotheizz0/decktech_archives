We’re In Attack Position Now	 '

Strategy 	


Start with Wakeelmui, Combat Response, Mob. Points, IAO.

Before you activate force pull kuat from reserve deck.

activate force, deploy kuat (now you get a +2 force generation

from Wakeelmui). Search for a docking bay. If in your starting

hand was Commander Brandei or Gherant, deploy them to the DB.

try to draw as fast as possible one of these guys for

a better force activation and the ability to pull Ex-sites in

your hand. Deploy them and draw. If you draw an asteroid field

or a big one deploy them to wakeelmui. Once both, Sienar Fleet Systems

and Flagship Ops on table you can deploy an emperor’s ship on the big one.

(don’t forget because of Flagship Ops every TIE is deploy -1 so the

Palpi’s Ships are deploy -3) retrieve 3 force. next turn let it die, and deploy 

another Palpi-Ship. retrieve 3 force. next turn you can activate as much as 

you want, except one card. If opponent’s first action in your control phase 

was to kill the ship, then the last card must be the destroyed ship. 

If you draw a system deploy it with a (matching pilot) TIE and a

star destroyer. With Admiral Chiraneau your drains on Sullust, Endor and 

Kashyyyk are each + 1. With the Scythe and Tallon Roll you can beat some

nasty rebel ships, like the falcon. if you want, you can track the

8-destiny ships (The emperor ones each TIE destiny +2) to have a 

high Tallon Roll total. 

Use the Undercover Spys to block opponent’s force drains.

Keep a Never Yalnal in hand to protect them from Corran Horn.

If you draw the asteroid fields deploy them to Wakeelmui to raise your

drains on Big One. It’s important to deploy the asteroids to 

wakeelmui, so its hard for opponent to come to the wakeelmui system.

I think Sienar Fleet System is a very powerful card, and I searched

for a way to deploy the Emps Ships more cheap. With Flagship Ops,

it’s pretty cool to deploy a 2-cost ship and then retrieve 3 force and

later let it die. Another way to retrive force is to battle the

opponent with an empi-ship where you have a little bit less power. 

At the end of the battle let it go to the used pile to track a high destiny

You should not have damage because your TIE has a high forfeit value.

(+6flagship Ops.)
