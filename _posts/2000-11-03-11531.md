Strategy: '

General - First Turn you should have a Signal and
go get A New Secret Base to grab a site or two , plus the Echo Docking Bay w/ Insurrection , if they give you two force you should be able to deploy an Ishi Tib to the Docking Bay to get going even better. The Ishi Tibs are great , they let you go through your deck even faster and stack useless Silver bullets. Use the 5 destinies for battle destinies or On the Edge too. This deck is pretty good but I know there is a lot of change that can go on so your suggestions are welcome. I don’t have more systems because this
deck doens’t need that much generation. The First Effect you should get after setting up EBO and A New Secret Base is Squadron Assignments so you can get a solid space force up in space. For the Ground I’m thinking of throwing in an Ice Storm or something too.
