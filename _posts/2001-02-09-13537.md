RESPONSE TO REVIEWS

Okay, first of all, what the changes mean, is that I have ADDED Run Luke Run and Glancing Blow, and TAKEN OUT 1 Smoke Screen and 1 Sense, not the other way around. Speaking of that sense, the small S/A package is just as a surprise to my oponnent, or used to save my ass at the right time. Against HD/BHBM, it can easily lost to a force drain. I use 3 EPP Obi

s as opposed to 3 Bens because I expecr Scum and non-Duel Huntdown. (Against both, weapons are NEEDED). If you want, replace the EPPs for 3 Bens, and remove the Anakins Saber for Obis Saber. My space is enough, the Falcon for covering drains and for TDIGWATT, Home One for everything else. (It may not be enough for a heavy-space deck, but no one in Endor plays those). Retrieval would be nice, but a good player can get around a couple On/Off the Edges easily, so I just play without it. If you want, take out the S/A for retreival, just as powerful. 



There have been a few changes to the deck, 1 Smoke Screen and 1 Sense goes out, Run Luke Run and Glancing Blow go in.



Early Game


Before you activate on your first turn, grab Crix and Blissex. The selection of Generals is simply to activate fast, no battle prowess whatsoever. Anyway, get them set up at the Hoth and Home 1 DBays. From here, you activate 11 on your own with only 1 zero in deck. Start assembiling your hand for fights.


Mid Game


Just go where ever your opponent is and kick the crap out of them with destiny adders, recyclable high destiny, and make good use of Insertion and Fallen Portal to just rock in battle.


(Dont tell me to take out the 1 Insertion Planning, it works with Luke, AND it works with Blount/Cracken who I can pull from deck with Crix, so the tech STAYS)


Late Game

Chase opponent with Order to Engage, and keep track of your high destiny cards left to battle your opponent into oblivion.


Thats it, I dont want to give a What to Against section, Im tired, and the strategy of this deck is always the same as above. Against a heavy space deck (not very popular right now), set up a ground drain, and do your best with the Falcon and Home One to bat your opponent around.


Whatever. Just have fun with it.
