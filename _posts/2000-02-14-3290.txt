Strategy: 

ok

Well all deck u start with stragic reserves
the idea is get a site every turn when u have all 8 out put a storm trooper at 3 and wait till they come after him
the ghhhhk him and then deploy vader tarkin and a lot of free storm troopers trooper assult and dark jedi presence but delpoy a couple at other sites with the objective flipped u have + 8 to your desity draw not that u need it with appros 10 stormtrrops at power 6 and dark and  tarkin it will be all over in a matter of 1 battle
 A special thank goes to Master for the insperaion for this deck.
