Weapon:

Strategy: 

This deck is very simple in its intent.  You pull out high destiny characters and deploy them.  If your opponent is very powerful use Uh-Oh and Bo Shuda to prevent battles.  If you think that you can win then put Kabe in the Audience Chamber and use your Chadra-Fans for combat.  Eloms can be powerful against imperials.
   Start with the Adience Chamber, and if your opponent does a Tatooine deck pull out Uh-Oh with The Signal.  If not, save your The Signals for pulling out other effects without losing the card.  If your opponent is very powerful, or doing a numbers deck himself, put down your droids, which have higher destiny than any other cards.  They not only have high destiny, but they also cannot be battled.
   Use A Gift and Bargaining Table to decrease the drains as much as possible.	Get out your effects quickly and use HDWGIM if your opponent doesn't want to circulate force.
