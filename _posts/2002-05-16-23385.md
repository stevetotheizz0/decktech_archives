Strategy: '

Average destiny is 2.63.

This deck was designed to beat Dark Strike beatdowns (appears a lot in my area). I am only eleven, and do not have too many good cards, and there are some cards I would like to add in (Ben (to keep with Han), Anakin&#8217;s Saber, better/more Lando, more Leias, etc.) but I don&#8217;t have them.

Starts Profit objective, with General Solo and the two locations. Starting interrupt is Heading for the Medical Frigate, with Insurrection & Aim High, Squadron Assignments, and Do, or Do Not. I do not have the starting effect.

Early Deploy and battle at the Audience Chamber. Preferably use Master Luke. Add a saber if possible. Use an Interrupt or two, and try to free Han.

Mid Once Han is freed, spread out a bit and drain using the relative safety of the interrupts. Use Projection of a Skywalker to reduce drains. Space is alright, enough to probably hold a system. If you get a Dodge or It&#8217;s a Trap and Han&#8217;s Pistol, put Han alone at a site, dodge/cancel their battle, shoot during your control phase, and move to kill a character. I usually use a pilot as forfeit fodder for Han, along with a stronger character (I like Panaka-high forfeit, okay power, 3 ability). I don&#8217;t have many sites because I can&#8217;t always keep them.

End Game Drain. Deploy task forces to take high drain locations. Try to have both Projection of a Skywalkers out. Just do the same as mid game. Before you draw, look to see if the cards you want are in your reserve deck.

Card Choices 

It&#8217;s a Trap-Most of the Dark Strikes used are the combo version. Also cancels battles.

Caldera Righim- Plain beat down stopper. Opponent can&#8217;t initiate a battle with more than 8 ability.

General Solo-It was either him or Premiere version. I don&#8217;t usually have enough force to pay ten to retrieve ten, so I use him instead.

Lost in the Wilderness- Cancels a drain+ makes a character missing.

Weapon Levitation-Either grab one of your weapons, or steal an opponents (stopping Dark Strike).

Don&#8217;t Get @#$%y-Four Lukes, if Han&#8217;s not on table I&#8217;m in trouble. After freeing Han they should be together.

Do, or Do Not-With many interrupts, and no SAC, I put in Do, or Do Not.

Matchups

Combat Projection of a Skywalker is your friend Together they will save two force a turn Don&#8217;t put your Jedi on Naboo, only use them as hit squads. Don&#8217;t put them at a drain location. Try to drain them out and kill their Jedi.

Black Sun Try to kill Xixor soon using nice interrupts, or get Luke to a safe Battleground. Space is all right, so battle in space. I once didn&#8217;t draw a Luke for the whole game (when I had three Lukes in) so now I have four.

Dark Deal Go for Bespin Cloud city, not system because Executer for free will kill. Split your forces (use enough to stop Dark Deal, and enough to free Han.  

Carbon Chamber Testing Hard game. Keep at least one Han outside of the Lost Pile. Hard game because they start flipped. For attrition, you will have to draw at least a four to kill an alien.

SYCFA Hold one system, maybe two if you draw enough space. You should be stronger on ground, save your nice stuff for space.

Hunt Down Keep Luke away from Vader. Try to kill all Mauls and Vaders. Vader may be around the Audience Chamber, so make sure that him and Luke are not together during opponents turn.

Senate Nothing you can do about the Senate. Drop some characters there sometimes, just to lower the amount of Senators. Fight as best as possible.
