Strategy: '

1st turn before I activate I take General Crix Madine into hand with Strike Planning. After activating, if I have a signal I use it for ANSB, if not then deploy Crix madine to echo docking bay and pull Geezum.  Using geezums text gets me echo sites and EBO will be set up just as fast as starting with ANSB.

Against Hunt Down.
Use Crix to pull your SPY SCOUTS(Cracken and Blount) to cancel visage. Or use Transmission terminated.	Just set up EBO and drain, fury vader, and legendary starfighter the falcon.

Against BHBM.
Same as above.	Deploy spys to the throne room and beat up on the emperor.  Set up EBO and drain.

ISB.
Control Curuscant and use the planet that its farthest from to cancel their bonuses.  Drain and beat up their agents.  Insertion Planning can be used with your scouts.

TIES.
Drain and drop legendary starfighter.  Use the bantha droid to cancel lateral damage.

Anything else.
Just do what you need to do.  Set up EBO and use Luke and Obi to battle.  Commander Luke can be brought to hand with EBG.  When he is in your hand, you can use squadron assaignments to grab R2 in R5.

Thanks for reviewing.
