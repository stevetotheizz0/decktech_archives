Strategy: '

First you play Prepared Defense
To get out IAO, crush the reb.,Mobilization points
then that allows you to take out cc-db,tat-db,exe-db, and mobilizations points allow for you to activate extra off of the db’s, you make them lose to visage, I honestly can say I have played with this deck for sometime now And in my opening hand have had a vader everytime, You have anti hiddenbase, and anti training, then you set up at the cc casino, and then you can go to casino, and downtown plaza, then you forcedrain, That is very useful, Iao gives you a good advantage with those ability two imperials. I also dont like for people to try to beat me down then leave.

I retreive alot with CC sabbac, The three dreadnaughts are in there beacause of the destiny of 3, alot better than those bh ships, well.

Try this deck and please if you have any comments or anything feel free to email me at iliv4starwars@aol.com

thanx
