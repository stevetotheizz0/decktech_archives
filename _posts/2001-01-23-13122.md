Strategy: '

SOMETIMES IT IS GOOD TO SWICH CRUSH THE REBELLION AND NO BARGAIN.

 sorry but take out alter and put in control.  That is the best way to go
ITS A HUNT DOWN DECK. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH A HUNT DOWN DONT YA?
for those of you who dont here you go...

Battle often. This deck is great against mains. Deploy Vader early. Always duel during battle phase while Tarkin is with Vader. Trample operatives or spies. Set up drains all over the galaxy against Hidden Base. Get Security Precautions out and then look for the Hidden Base with Hound’s Tooth and Executor.
