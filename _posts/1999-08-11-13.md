Strategy: '

This deck plays of the pre-errata Droid Merchant engine where you get a lot of activation with minimal effort.  The potential for the game to end in one battle is very effective, with effects such as Descent into the Dark (to recycle) and interrupts like How did we get into this mess (searcher), you can have an EPP strikeforce within the first couple turns of the game.  With that advantage the game can turn in your favor in the matter of one turn.  My philosophy about this deck is if you can get past a turn two "choke" vader coming down and beating on your droid merchants...then you have a 90% chance of winning the game.'
