Walker Garrison

Strategy: '

I know there is only one Walker Garrison in the deck  I don’t use this deck to play Walker Garrison multiple times, in fact I have actually used the other text on WG more then the +drain text.  I figured Start Your Landing could muster up enough direct damage and good force drains to stand a chance against any deck.  The reason for the random high destiny cards was because a big blue deck is notorious for having low destiny.  Just a simple set up.  Get piett/majjerk to executor docking bay, play the executor to Hoth and start making them lose force for the sites that you are draining/occupying/landing damage. '
