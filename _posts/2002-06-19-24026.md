Strategy: '

Early Game 

Set up like normal, always deploy Jabba with Audience Chamber text, unless he is in your hand. Deploy Boelo, Bib, and Ephant Mon with POTH. This should be enough to hold the Chamber for a good while. Use R3 Bib so you can get whatever you need out a LOT faster. If everything youre looking for is in your reserve, just use a force and youve got a better chance of getting them. Wait to deploy your own bounty hunters, until they deploy their own characters. 9 bounty hunters should be enough to last the whole game, otherwise retrieve some. 


Mid Game

Get Scum out ASAP. If you think youll be doing most of the battling, you can also deploy First Strike. This will choke them a bit, and add more retrieval and force loss. Battle, Capture, Deliver, Battle, Capture, Deliver, etc.


End Game

If they have Aim High, be sure you have enough force to retrieve when you deliver. Get Rancor out and eat away. This will kill your opponent fast enough, especially if you have 2 or more captives.


Card Explanations

Broken Concentration I can take away 1 force of theirs each turn. If they save one for a barrier, or an interrupt for battle, just take it away and their plans will be ruined.  


Were The Bait 7 destiny, excellent for DD. If they are playing MWYHL, get this out ASAP and go for Han, Leia, or Chewie. If successful, not only is their whole deck shot to pieces, they lose 2 force per turn.


No System? That doesnt really matter, most light decks will have one.


Zuckuss + 4-LOM + Boba Fett, BH = 7 power, they need 7 ability to draw destiny, you have 4 Battle Destinies


Some Cards I Want to add

Weapon Levitation Steal sabers for Aurra, I have 3 characters that can steal with this.


Imperial Barrier Obvious reasons, however it is easily canceled, and that really hurts when youre counting on it to save you life.


Rancor 1 may not be enough, gotta be sure to get it on table.



This deck is still pretty new, I just made it recently. It needs help, but I think that if I can get that help, this could be a really competitive deck. Thanks all for the advice
