Strategy: '

Oh kay then, it's simple to see what I'm doing here, get out 3-4 sites and put up at-st's and at-at's to hold the ground.  Since this deck is all about reacting, holding the ground is easy as hell.	Once sites are secured, fight anywhere with the +3-4 destiny and clean up.  OK, if you didn't see the super tech already, here's the deal.  Get out Death Star and have it orbit ralltiir asap.  Once you get Torent to the war room drains are +1 at ralltiir.  Booooooya  Bad Feeling + Wrong Turn is sooooo painful that's it's tech.  Obi for 10?  Then he's imp barriered?  Ouch, SHIAT.....pain....tech
