Strategy: 

This has a very good mixture of sites. Having 2/0 sites and 2/2 sites make the deck very versatile in what I want to accomplish with it. I usually start with the Death Star which gives me good activation and gives them no force. It also allows me to start ABCTTU if I need to.

My character selection I feel is very powerful. The characters are pretty powerful and have high forfeit value, so you should be able to control most of the sites you want to.

My choice in interrupts is also good. A little mixture of Sense/Alter (3 apiece) allows me to cancel certain cards that might cause problems. Twi'Lek for needed effects.

As you can see, I have a lot of effects and all of them serve a purpose. I have many choices as a starting effect depending on what your opponent is playing. Here are some of the OPTIONS (you can always start something else depending on your style):

Against HB: You can start Security Precautions. With all the ships in here, you should have no problem probing. Lateral Damage will also help.

Against OPS: Start ABCTTU. You have the power to beat up the little aliens. I don't see them being much of a problem.

Against Retrieval Decks: Sense/Alter/Hell2Pay/Secret Plans/Come Here You Big Coward will all do their part in totally shutting down retrieval decks.

Against Mains: Many options to choose from. Bad Feeling Have I is one.

Against Revolution: Start Crush The Rebellion and play Evader when needed. It's pretty cool to send Mara Jade down and beat up a lone little Oola hanging out at the Throne Room!

Come Here You Big Coward is a huge effect in this deck and is worth considering starting with. This will make it so they can't drain at your 2/0 sites and you have the power to take them out from wherever they are trying to drain from.

I overall feel this is a great deck, but as always, I would like advice on making it better. Please give me any suggestions or comments. Thanks for reviewing!
