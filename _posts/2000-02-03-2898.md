Strategy: '

On the first turns get the 2-1 system out, maybe
drop one or two xwings to them, but watch out that
you have barrier or hyper escape in hand. Then go
for the 'drain' systems. Do not deploy too many
wings to the 'big three'. Just barrier your opponents
ships and then go for the beatdown. Use the cannon and
rapid fire to get rid of those bounty hunter ships.

If your opponents tries to go to the ground, just use
your undercover spies and the arconas to block their
drains. If ote is out you can deal a little extra
damage. If you got your Arconas and Spies out, just
insert NTMTO...

I think this deck has some good chances winning
against most of the dark side decks around in
my region....
