Strategy: 


		 This a pretty basic, but solid BHBM deck.
		 It can hold its ground against most
		 anything. Basically sense or alter what you
		 can. Play circle
		 on ben, then kill off whatever else with your
		 sabers and dr. evason. Play lateral Damage
		 on thier mon calamaries and kill off with
		 executor. Then use Dr. Evason and vader or boba or whoever has a weapon, put
		 disarmed on someone good, like lea or han and operate before a battle even
		 happens then play circle, HAHA mains die, you crush them in battle. Captain Sarkli is in there because in my area, some people still play liberation.
		 AGAINST PROFIT:
		 Either start Mara and Jabba, or Jabba and
		 evason. Then get everyone to jabbas
		 apalce. Be shure to sense SOWLY, so
		 they can be cheap. Get out secret plans to
		 stop retriving by opponent. Sniper han, you win by battling.
Against EBO:
Start Imperial Decree, secret plans. Invade hoth. Make shure you CONTROL 2 echo sites so decree will work to stop force drain bonuses. Then drain on hoth and kill of baraguins or whatever they have there, watch out for icestorm

ANYTHING ELSE:
React to what opoonent does. If the play Hidden Base, get out security precatuins, probe and battle. Probing will keep you from taking battle damage because of security precations.

PLEASE REVIEW!
