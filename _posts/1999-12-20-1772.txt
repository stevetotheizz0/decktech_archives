Strategy: '

Vs MWYHL CHYBC should kill all if not most of their retrieval. As soon as they get some guys down, kill them.

Vs Ops The force choke wont do much against ops. Just gather up some force and guys and invade their planet

Vs Hidden Base Get Security Plans out as soon as possible, send all your guys up on ships to kick butt.

Vs Quiet Mining Colony Pretty much the same. Wait for them to drop guys and then beatdown.

Against pretty much anything Get locations and counter cards out as soon as possible. When they drop some guys beatdown, beatdown, beatdown. '
