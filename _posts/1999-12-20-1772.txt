Strategy: 

Vs MWYHL: CHYBC should kill all if not most of their retrieval. As soon as they get some guys down, kill them.

Vs Ops: The force choke wont do much against ops. Just gather up some force and guys and invade their planet

Vs Hidden Base: Get Security Plans out as soon as possible, send all your guys up on ships to kick butt.

Vs Quiet Mining Colony: Pretty much the same. Wait for them to drop guys and then beatdown.

Against pretty much anything: Get locations and counter cards out as soon as possible. When they drop some guys beatdown, beatdown, beatdown.
