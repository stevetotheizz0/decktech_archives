Objective

Rescue the princes/I Amase Even Myself

Leia can add one battle destiny.Plus Attrition against opponent is +2. And Jedi, Imperials, andImperialStarships lose immunity to attrition. Now Darth Vader won’t be safe


Effects

Cell 2187

Since Detention Block is the only other Death Star site deaploy cell 2187 to the corridar .Get General Solo to the detenntion corridar and  you have a extrime chance to rescue the princes


Hoth Sentery 

Don’t you wish this card was non-unique.  Power is the key. Use this card to add 1 to power.


A New Secret Base

Have alot of Imperial Decrice in your area and you have yavin 4 this card will help.You could get the EchoCorridar or Ehco Garrisons if there not out already. And it is immune to alter so it won’t get canceled.


Manuver Flaps

Combat Vehicles are power +2 and the forfite. Don’t deploy the flaps till Zev is out.Now they have to get a 9 to deastroy Rouge 2. Aso you get a battle destiny


Draw Their Fire

another way to retrive force. and the destiny is good for a weapon destiny.


Squadron Assignment

5 destiny and immune to alter. The best part of this card is thatyou can eather get the maching ship or pilot.


Echo Base Garrisons

Rouge 2 will be immune to Attrition <6. If Zev isn’t on table you may get him from the deck. If only this card was immune to alter. 


Interupts

Houijix

If you have a weak character in a battle and you forfite him you can cancel remaning bamage. Or sondown can be canceled.


Organize Attack

The destiny of 5 is good for a weapon and battle destiny.The best part is the x-wings and y-wing are power +1.


Slight Weapons Malfunction

For a used interupt you just need to fire a weapon to get a battle destiny.


Darklighter Spin

Use this card with Red Squadron 4 and Hobbie and you have a 6 for a battle destiny. This card could win you the game.


Don’t Underestimate Our Chances

Play this card right after you win a battle.Say his damage is 6. Triple 6 and he loses 18 force. A real life saver at the end of the game.


Take the intentive

Since the power is the key use this card to and 1 to power. Hopefuly you will be attacked by creature.


They’d Be Crazy to follow us

If an apponents ship is at an astoroid sectoryou will be looking at a ship in the lost pile. The Reason is because this card adds 2 to weapon destiny.


The Signal

The destiny could help you deastroy ships ,but the best part is that you can take ”Any kind of effect” for just 3 force. This will help you with rescuing the princes.


Characters

Chewbacca of Kashyyyk

A power 6 character. He adds 2 to power. And may become defence value 4. Now some weapons won’t kill him. He will be power+1 because he is a scout and Take the Intentive says”For Remainder of the turn your unique scout are power +1 


General Solo

Now we have someone to rescue the princes. A scout so he is affected by Take the Intentive.Get him with chewi to cancel a battle destiny.


Derek’Hobbie’Klivian

He adds 2 to power of anything he pilots. Get him to the same site of a stardeastroyer and heal add 3 to power


Prisoner 2187

She has no deploy cost.At the Detention Block you will have a 3 for a force drain.She is just as good as General Solo.


Admiral Ackbar

A leader. Deploy him to the Nebulon Frigate. It will be power7 and a destiny draw. '
