Strategy: '

When I read the Profit obj, i thought it was builded to play with mains on Tatooine.
So let's go for a tatooine deck with tatooine celebration.
With friends it was also clear that light must play with Sense and have an huge retrieve potential. Then, there's the deck...

Strategy.
Start Battle Plan.
Play defensive and free Han (retrieve 10).
Set up the celebration and retrieve, also play XWings (hit ships with wonderful Xwing cannon), cancel drains and retrieve (up to 10).
