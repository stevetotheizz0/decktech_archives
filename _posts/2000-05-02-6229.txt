********It seems that someone didn't understand that the test #4 was a joke....hmmmmm where is the humor on Decktech???****************



ok, this deck is pretty straight forward, past those 2 tests, drain in space and stop their drains.

I decided to play in space because I don't like battling those AT-at and at-st.

Start wize advice unless you play against ops....start battle plan in this case.

I don't have anything to say...like I said, It's straight forward....but really effective. If you have comments, let me know and I could change some things or explain some other

Have fun and good luck  '
