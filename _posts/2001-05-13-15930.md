*****THIS IS A PRE TATOOINE DECK*******


Okay first of all dont review this deck until you’ve read all of this section, and if you see anything really wierd with my deck, d-mail me before, because there is probally some reason for it. 


Okay using this deck you start with careful planning which gets Obi-Wan’s Hut and Tosche Station. FIrst turn chances are theres an Obi in your hand. If there is deploy him to the hut and move him over to the station. If there is no Obi, you should deploy some guy to tosche station (unless you expect a quick beatdown) and draw up the next (Obi WILL be in there). See what your opponet’s using and form around. Use Naburns to fly people around. Where I play IAO isn’t a big problem, I’ve played agenst one deck with IAO in the last 5 tournament games (3 state champs, 2 local), but if it is, put in a spiral, maybe a system, and some other thing. Late in the game revo the hut and get a stick there, or DOS and drain bunchs.


Why I Use Some Cards


DoS- Well I couldnt get my hands on another Leia with Blaster or a Bousshh, but if you have those use them insted.


x2 C/TV- I activate so much that this card can help, and this helps agenst big drains and SAC


Naburn Leids- see beginning 


Choke- For some reason if you opponet beats you down where you have an alein it works like a houjix. And it can cancel Ephant Mons game text agenst a Hunt Down, or possibly court.


TK-422- Well I needed some undercover guy


So many Bens- He’s the key to my deck


If you have any questions about this part please d-mail me, e-mail me @ MrCheezNcho@aol.com or IM me @ MrCheezNcho




Matchups



Court (or any other palace aleins deck)- Slip into the palace with a naburn, beatdown on there people, and make them lose to thier own ojb. The only court deck I’ve used this agenst, i won by 45.


Raltiir Ops, Operatives- You might wanna switch some stuff for Ounee Ta, if theese decks are popular where you are. Use Naburns wisely, and attck when thier weak (if you can). I beat a Ral Ops deck by 29 with this deck.


Hunt Down Battle- Great matchup, try to get thier obj. flipped back quick, and get honor out ASAP, if thier not using No Escape. If they are playing Ephant Mon with Visage, Choke will WIN the game for you.


Hunt Down Duel- Give Obi-Wan and Luke thier sticks and cross your fingers....


Big Blue- Use the landing claw wisely, attck when necessary, and drain at your ground sites. This will be the most fun matchup.


Any other deck- beat them down whereever you are



Thanks for reviewing my deck, questions, d-mail me, or e-mail me.  '
