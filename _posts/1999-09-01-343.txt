Strategy: 

This is a mains and toys deck with certain variations
which I think enables it to beat most light decks.
I start with Jabba's Palace and choose my interrupt
based on what my opponent is playing. Against Operatives
I start with Battle Order, against Hidden Base i start
with Resistance, and against anything else I start with
Combat Readiness for the Cantina. Then, basically
establish drains on the ground and battle your
opponent wherever they are. I included Endor because
I think it is a great system (you drain for 2,
opponent drains for 1) and can tip the scales in
my favor vs. another ground deck if I can set up
a drain there.
