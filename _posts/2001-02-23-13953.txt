Strategy: 

 
By second turn have the Fat Man and Ephont in the Chamber and if Iâ€™m lucky enough to pull either Jabba or Gailid in the opening hand, Gaild too. I get to look in my deck enough that I should be able to get Gailid early. Put a gamorrean and any other character at each site. Get Expand the Empire at the Entrance Cavern and drain like mad.

For the exterior sites, a gamorrean at Tat:JP and some muscle (Snoova, Xizor, Mara, Guri) on the skiff at one of the other sites and react to the other sites if opponent wants to battle.

When its at the point where I feel the game is in hand, I use Weapon of an Ungrateful Son to put al my weapons back in deck.

The Gamorrean axes make this deck quite good. My pigs are power 5, draw destiny, swing for free, and the ax can forfeit for 3 and go to the used pile. Not much chance of a beatdown in this deck.
