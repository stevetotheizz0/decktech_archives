Starting stuff
You Can Either Profit By This/OBD, Tatooine Jabba’s Palace, Jabba’s Palace Audience Chamber, Heading For The Medical Frigate for Do, Or Do Not, Insurrection, and Uh-oh

Object of deck
1st turn, pull Bo Shuda and Endor Landing Platform.  Deploy an Ithorian and 2 Ewoks at each site you can; at others, a few Ewoks.  Use Ewok Rescue, Sound The Attack, and Fallen Portal to aid in your defense.  With the Ithorians, Kazak, and Tessek out, you’ll be able to drain for at least 4 at every Endor site.
Anakin’s Lightsaber is great for use in defending Endor and enhancing drains with DOS, or giving to Jedi Luke for some off-Endor battling.  Lando With Vibro-Ax can stave off some off-Endor forces for a turn; giving the popularity of DS Tatooine decks thanks to My Kind Of Scum, running two of him provides for lethal battling.
Bo Shuda and Order To Engage should keep the Audience Chamber clear (unless opponent wants to lose 3 per turn), and should lend a hand in being able to free Han at your leisure.
Beggar is nice for when your opponent is saving big or just to get around some untimely Barriers or whatnot.
Rennek is to protect the AC from Bubo; later can be used in pair with Lando for double destiny.
Choke is a great card.	You can either cancel an important alien’s gametext prior to battling them, or in a battle, let’s say on Endor, and you have some major attrition, you can forfeit 1 Ewok, then Choke to cancel the rest
With all your modifiers and ability to pound any DS forces coming to the Forest Moon, you should be able to win the drain race.
