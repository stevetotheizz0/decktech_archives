strategy

this deck trains luke to 5 or 6. i use luke because he pulls his saber makin my test destiny obscenly low and incase some one actually comes down to dagobah
after this deck flips, i use on/off the edge to retrieve and go around bashing my opponent

match ups

endor ops(no flip)
no problems here. this deck type falls easily to my mwyhl and poses little threat.


endor ops(flip)
problem especially if they have perimeter patrol(?) to slow me down. handle space and keep up the pressure to wear down the opponent. retrieve as always.

mkos
this could be trouble just because of my low total power. keep on going and pray they don’t retrieve too much

hunt down
watch out for vador and go about your business training and battling

bhbm
no worries. be happy.
keep luke from vader and you’re set. leave him on dagobah

thanks
