Strategy: '

WARNING NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART, EXPERTS CAN BEAT ALOT OF PEOPLE, BUT IN THE WRONG HANDS THIS DECK BOARDERS ON THE INSANE
Suprise the heck out of your opposition, and get a chance to watch other people finish their games.  Use CP to get the two sites you need, and deploy a droid to the Lars' Farm and HS/Vaporator if you have them.  Draw up.  Your opponent has had two turns to deploy something,  maybe a DLOTS to the Endor Docking bay.  Your turn, deploy a Luke's speeder to mos eisly, sell.  Use HDWGITM to recycle hand untill you get desent into the dark, and play it. Continue to sell landspeeders as necissary (you can keep them at the CSM) and use HDWGITM to cycle through to get all your mains.	Deploy where he is as you get your EPPs, and anything else.  Tie up loose ends by getting a nice mix of destiny adders in your hand.  Play DTF/FA/Begger to prevent Ghhhk and beat away.  Game over 2nd turn if you are lucky.	The rest of the deck is for unforseen future.  Use harvest liberally, and maybe sense/alter some stuff.  This deck is virtually unbeatable in the hands of an expert, even if they do something sneaky or unforseen.

P.S. I forgot to add a Mechanical failure for walkers and battle plan... take out the Vaporator and Wise Advise.  You can take out a nabrum if you really want to keep that wise advice.  '
