Strategy: '

@@@@ Switch out a projective telepathy for Guri. 


Setting Up Before you activate pull out Rendili, Then activate and use Endor Ops to search for Ominous Rumors. Pull out A docking bay put

down Janus, Igar, or Tarkin to the bunker and deploy Ominous Rumors Patrol. Then Send YCHF to pull our Perimeter Patrol Deploy and draw a if you have to darw 1 or 2. Setup in space quick and if they come to fight beat them down with all youve got. Use your multiple destnys from Thrawn, Bossk, and Imperial command. Drain if they dont come to you and if they play dumb you can beat them down on the ground.


The Cards Lateral Damage the Super Falcon and slow their activation and drains with Battle Order. Cancel their force drain bonuses with decree. Retrieve with First Strike. Cancel their retrieval with Something Special Planned for them. If you get in trouble and use GHHHK and Projective Telaphthy to keep you alive. Make luke go missing with ATWYS. This deck is fun to play and it wins.
