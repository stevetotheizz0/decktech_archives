Strategy: '

Start with uh-oh, pull out bo shuda (it wont get canceled) on the first turn. Now, stick somebody in the chamber with orders to engage, they will move out of there instead of losing three a turn. Free Han and leave him in the chamber with the its a trap to cancel sniper. Rennek makes sure that han doesn't get munched on by bubo. Throw tessek and tanus in the chamber too to makes those eloms deploy two and power 6 in the cantina with a drain of three.

This deck is kinda weak against space or court but if you play smart, you can win. Against space decks, pick the top drains and stick a ship there with a claw. Use yoxgit to get the claws back into hand if they cancel it. For court, take artoo and get a gift working, then battle and take them out on attrition. Other than that, just free han, wait for them to leave some imperials alone and nabrun and kick some ass.

Don't forget to keep boushh away from jabbas palace so uh-oh still works. She is the only rebel in the deck.
