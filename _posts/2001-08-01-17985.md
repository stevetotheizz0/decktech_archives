Strategy: '

Okay this is a good OLD Dagobah Deck im Training Crix other than 

luke or leia as they are much better beating down with.

My starting effects i choose Battle Plan well to slow there 

drains down while i wait for a site or something to beatdown with.

Striking planning is so i can start traing grab my crix. 

Wise advice is so i add one to desting draws for training.


My starting plan is to grab training area deploy yoda and yoda’s 

hope there and pull test one and if enough force play crix as well.

by the second turn i have the test one on table and ready for desting 

draw next turn. im also pulling test every turn with training area.

And complete test after test to test 5. if you ask why train crix 

well because i can pull my two scouts cracken and blount and play 

undercover on them. Which will either kill a huntdown or stop a drain 

for good. Stone piles are a great card i have pulled some gun crads 

with this and also cut out mara or vader from the game if they dont 

play mutilpiles. Projections are to stop big drains or even eliminate 

big drains.The signal grabs my effects. A jedi’s resilience major kick

arse card. Text of card that i like cancel a duel by losing 1 force and 

if you just lost a character with a lightsaber take him into hand. 

Not bad Not bad at all. Weapon levitation steal weapon or grab weapon 

for say Qui-Gon at the city outskirts or cantina.I know 4 transmission 

terminated is pushing but huntdown is a big deck in my section of play, 

and with hoonet tranmission i could have some trouble.

On the edge is main retriving card. sense well cancel a interrupt. 

Bith suffle combo is mainly to stop imperial barrier which i dont need

played when i beatdown with luke with lightsaber

and obi with saber. Glancing blow well basically win a duel or make 

vader power zero. My location selection is a tosche station i cant 

actviate heaps of force and pay to drain. Cantina nice drain site.

City outskirts is too pull jedi probably luke or qui-gon i also play 

two so i can get it early hopefully.

The way of things is a card to get before test 2 complete or  just 

when its complete so i can complete test 3 straight away.

I hope she’s alright is in there if i play a full space deck i can 

play that and lose for for not having a character at a battleground site.

Traffic control well put cards you dont want. and ewok catapult for test 5.


Against other decks.


Hunt down

well i cancel visage so i cant just beatdown on there @#$%.

blount or ckacken will stop the reappear or visage or if 

they keep on playing holonet tranmission.


Court

well beat it like a @#$% just breakdown there drains and beatdown.


isb

bonusues cancelled i would just have to watch for sandwhirls.

or walkers.


Black sun

Never played it before i would just see how they were playing it.

i guess try and get rid or xzior.


Space

i get them to lose from i hope she’s all right for not having a ground force and it would just be a drain race.


Ral ops

i would have to go there and beatdown with epps-)



well i think thats it i cant think of any other decks at the moment.

i hope you like and i would like to thank luca for the help.


Thanks .Master^Matt.
