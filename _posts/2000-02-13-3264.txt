Strategy: 

Basic strategy: Go to wherever they are and fight

Vs. HB: Start with Security Precautions and load of the starfighters in the deck with bunches of mains and battle, battle, battle. Probe if they flip.

Vs. Profit: Start with Dengar and Mara. Pull out her saber first turn. Deploy several more mains there as time moves on and generally just keep them from getting Han. If, and when they get him out, eradicate their mains by lots of battling.

Vs. MWYHL: Start with CHYBC to stop any retrieval they might have. This will also encourage them to get out some battlegrounds where you can beatdown.

Vs. Tosche: Get mains to the station as soon as possible and prevent them from controlling at all costs. Tosche decks generally dont run very many locations, so if you can prevent the activation at the station, they will have very little force to work with (they are getting none from you)

Vs. Ops: Ops is easy. Get guys to their planet very early and prevent pretty much all deployment you can. Dengar will hit speeders if they play them.

Vs: anything else: Go where they are and beatdown repeatedly until you win.
