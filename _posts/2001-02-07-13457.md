Strategy: '

So as you see this deck has changed quite a lot since i last posted it. But(probably) you might

have not never seen this deck before. So i will skip the changes and focuse on the deck itself.


The strategy is to beat opponent both in space and ground. The deck should be quite(but not too) heavy on characters and ships so it is balanced. Remember POWER is the key And this deck has it(with not too poor destiny).

Win three(four if Luke is a jedi) battles=win game.


You can also inflict considerable drains. You have two "presence of the force". One is good to play to

the "throne room" in mid or end game(you need to loose "Emperors power" to drain). Other with your own planning.


Conquering space will bring the victory for you in many games. So here is some advice.

Dont play too many ships on your low parsec system as something like Kessel might pop up

If Falcon is your nightmare, play GURI to space(Executor will really do the job).

If X-wings are coming, keep your boats in tight groups. Battle deployment with Thrawn is iron here.


Ground war shouldnt be a problem with the number of mains. Drop one presence to Carida if opponent is too heavy on ground. Battle order is steel


Alright then here comes the matchups


MWYHL Drain heavily and battle. When they are about to do JT5, screw thier tracking with

uncertain is the future


EBO Fight in space, rule the ground and drain. Walkers can storm Hoth if necessary. Resistance will help.


WYS Take space, use Guri there if necessary. Grap their key interrupt. Conguer ground, Thrawn and Battle deployment will do wonders in your conguest for Tatooine. Play "presences" to your DS2 sites, so your activation(and drains) are secured to high level.


RTP Rule space, fight in ground. Try cancel bacta tank and kill the princess(many times).

if they flip be carefull not lose(out of play) Vader when he goes capture Luke. "Shut him up or shut him down" will be their death.


QMC Take Bespin=win, so A LOT OF FORCE THERE


Mains Battle and drain. Oola is no problem with "Shocking revelation"


Agents in court Start Battle order. Aliens and droids can strike them. Imperials will probably have to move to JP.

Walkers can attack to sandstormed sites.


HP Havent played ever so ??? Your fleet is enough to create a threat or crush them.


Thanks for the reviews Tell me what went wrong(if any). '
