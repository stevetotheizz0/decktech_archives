Strategy: '

I tried this deck with out ships before, but at the tournament, I got killed by a WYS and HD deck. At each system, they only had one ship, so I decided to add them. Also, I thought about playing non dualing, but I found that the extra 6’s helped and killing Luke or Obi really hurts the opponent


This deck is simple. Race on the first turn and flash Ani if they have him. Otherwise dont bother. On the second turn, get Vader to a battle ground site and flip. I decided to add No Escape In place of a Intruder missle. I got my @#$% kicked by Honor. This deck has beatin a WYS racing deck by winning the race. The opponent gave up after I won the race with destiny of a 10, 9, and an 8. I slaughtered another once they tried to use It could be worse and I said "It is 

worse". 


The main reason I dont have a Choke Vader in this deck is because I dont own one. I like him and would replace a DV with stick for him. I have 2 mauls because I like beat downs and maul is one of the best. 


I know that I have a large amount of Racing Interupts in this deck (5), but I got sick of loosing. If you loose the race, then you’ve basically lost the game. After that there is no way to retrive.


Against Mains and other Ground decks

When playing against these decks, dual Obi or Luke as fast as possible. Win the race and cause them to loose to visage. You could keep Vader in your hand and wait until you get a beat down. Dont get caught in a battle with Han, Luke, and Leia because if they play destiny adders, you will be hurt bad. Try to get Vader w/ stick and GMT against luke. Initiate a battle and during the battle Cause a dual. Use Focsed attack to draw three and cancle one of his with tarkin.


Against Ship decks

Set up fast against these decks and make sure they loose to visage every turn. Get out Search and Destroy and cause damage with that. Hold on to your ships (make sure he doesnt think you have any) and wait until he spreads out. If he is caught with a single x-wing against you Chimera, Zuckuss with ship, and Boba Fett in ship, he will get his @#$% kicked. Win the race and end the game with no problem at all.


Use these strategies and you should win most games. Dont initiate a dual if you feel the sightest concern becasue if you loose, you loose the game almost right then. Dmail me before you give me a bad rating. I dont see many problems. I understand that the Inturder missles are not that great, but they have helped so much.

Good Luck '
