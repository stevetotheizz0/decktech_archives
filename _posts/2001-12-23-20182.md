Strategy: '

my first turn usually consists of my putting someone in space and a palace raider at home one docking bay to generate me alot next turn. 


card choices 


2 celebrations? youll always get it, and if it gets cancelled, just play another, and if that gets cancelled, play effective repairs, and if it gets cancelled again, play repairs again, that is...if you havent retrieved the 1st one already. MUAHAHAHHAHAAHA 


new hope houjix? 

cancels sunsdown too cold for speeders combo which hurts really bad, and it cant be cancelled by Take Evasive Action 


revolution should be in any WYS. people always leave random 2 ability guys at 1/0 docking bays because they arent afraid of spy beats...well... 


goo nee tay x2 is a must nowadays 


effective repairs (shannon TECH) is awesome. a must 


i only play 1 ooc/tt because it ALWAYS gets grabbed. 


if your playing against dark deal or huntdown non-dueler, start menace fades. theyll give you enough force so you dont have to start staging areas. 


pull kessel into your hand and keep it untill late game, especially if its a drain race. DONT deploy kessel for the 1st half of the game. with only 3 starships in the deck, it is key to hold tatooine for the 1st half, or untill you get everything set up. 


there are only 2 cards which are key in this deck. Ill take the leader and tatooine celebration. with 3po, mirax, and the 2 of them present in your deck, getting them wont be hard at all. 

well, thats about it, have fun 


This deck is undefeated in tournament play. even in the worst situations, it had helped me through. this deck is a force on its own. i bet sean vess could win with this deck. the best light deck ive ever seen is andy mcclure’s senate beats deck, but this has to be the 2nd, muahahahhaahhahahah


the versitility of this deck is insane and can do almost anything.
