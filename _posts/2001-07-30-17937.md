Strategy: '

Okay the basic strategy is to give luke to an imperial (ideally not Vader to cause some force loss) then drop a beat squad on the guys use your battle interuppts to cause massive overflow or jump them 3 times and then track a 6 to turn vader.


This deck is 5-1 in sanctioned play with the only loss coming to an agents are landing deck, and I changed 2 twix sites for the 2/2 to get better drains to combat that.  There are a good deal of recycling high destinys and 3PO to get the stuff out quick, but now on to the match-ups.


BHBM move Vader to the Throne room if they duel great you should win then they will stop after they have stacked a few, give them a beating for the rest of the cards you need to stack, or just kill them with overflow


MKOS if they play without IAO they are dead, if they use it, you need to drop squads and sense their NSP’s and Imperial barrier, Honor keeps it so you only lose the sense.


Racist Huntdown htis was built to combat that.  Insight stops the odds, Luke can’t be dueled, You have 2 obis and 2 jedis reslience don’t deploy him without it.  Then try to win the duel (possible with the destiny) if you lose no biggie, outdrain and damage them.


Space probably the hardest matchup, kill whoever picks up luke, and try to hold a system, Wedge and Han Leia on falcoln, plus someone on Red 6 can keeep you in it.  the toughest matchup.


Okay this deck is pretty well balanced and can handle most anything that gets thrown at it.  THe 61st card is draw their fire, since so few people (around here at least) play with Ghhk it is not vital.  Any other specific questions D-mail me and I’ll answer them.  Otherwise have fun, and happy beatings. '
