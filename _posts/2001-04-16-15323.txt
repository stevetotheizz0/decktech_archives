Strategy: '

mostly old school beat down with EPP and frozen assets.

first pull dagobah and the hut, with any DB, wait till your opponent deploys something then hit’em where it hurts.this deck activates alot quick and does good against most ground decks. 
against space fight there weakest location with the supa falcon fully loaded with multiple destinies, then drain on the ground, and cause loss with i hope shes all right.
easy to play. '
