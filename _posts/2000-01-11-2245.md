Strategy: '

Well.. ill explain my changes to you

i put in more starships, one YT-1300 transport who can make the most desperate hour, and one gold squadron Y-wing wich i find better than Redemption. I also took baccta tank out, and the glimmer stick since i only had use for those cards when i already had the advantage anyway. I added some more interrupts, hyper escape and different tracking interrupts. Sorry about the mess instead of under attack. I also prefer lando in falcon before falcon, EPP Han can make a killer machine of any other ship anyway. the alters are booth to cancel effects (lateral damage among others) but also as effective sense protection.

Tibrin rocks..
