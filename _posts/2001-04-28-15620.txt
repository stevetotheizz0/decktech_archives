Strategy: '

 
 This was my Deck it plays in 3 games (5-0)
 2 Full Win, 1 Modiefied Win.
 In the Modified Win I make bad mistakes it was
 easy to win full but i to the false thing.
 The Dark Deck makes my 5th place MKOS only win
 one of 3 games I played with Dark Deck 3 Times
 against WYS and there are only 4 WYS at the Tourney

 This TIGH plays against two MKOS and 1 Court Deck.

 The first thing is I played Rebel Scout Luke, he
 can cancel the Immunity of combat vehicles and
 relocate to Throne Room (against BHBM)

 In the 1st Turn I get out General Solo and 
 General Crix Madine, get Crix to the Home OneDB
 and Luke to the Endor Docking Bay. Take Chewie
 in. Next Time get Wuta out Deploy a scout to Madine
 (I dont want him alone). Most of My Characters
 are here for battle, use the Scouts to beat down
 your opponnents Characters. And Drain with
 Luke Leia and Midge at Endor. General Solo with
 Rebel Leadership is very Powerful. 
 I fight against a Scum Deck, with 6 Scouts 
 and add a Destiny with Rebel Leadership, he 
 cancel one with Boelo a 2, second was a 6, with
 Take the Initative Battle Destiny 12 12 attrition
 it was Bad for Scum. One Destiny cancel and with 
 Insert Planning Oppponenst remainig Destiny was 0

 This was a battle that hurt much
 Corran is good for this Deck works great against
 bounty hunters and he is spy and can use with Take the 
 Initative(Powerful Card)

 I get Under Attack and Concussion Missle for
 Sail Barge and other combat vehicles. 

 This Deck works very good  '
