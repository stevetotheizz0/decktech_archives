Objective:

Strategy: 

As you can see from the deck list, it's a standard ISB drop-and-drain with IAO. Generally start IAO and pull the docking bays early.

Vs LS Mains & Toys

Take it slow, they probably won't commit their mains until you give them a target. Deploy your locatons, but don't deploy any agents on ground until you can back them up with a Ghhhk and a Main Course. Make sure you have a battle destiny at your sites - you might not need to Ghhhk then (remember, you can retrieve ISB agents but you can't retrieve Ghhhks). If possible, you should try to force EPP mains to commit to space early in the game, so your agents ca be safe. If they ever leave a weak spot, exploit it with Vader/Walkers.

Vs LS Ops

You can afford to use speed to your advantage here. Start with ABCTTU and try to get a ship to defend it ASAP. Spread out, and you can probably outdrain an Ops deck, and remember to use Vader/Walkers to exploit weak spots and get your agents down to their planet.

Vs LS MWYHL

Start with Broken Concentration, and try to get the jump on them. Keep Ghhhks at the ready in case of EPPs.

Vs LS HBase

Get the early jump on them, and when they flip use Sec Prec. with forfeit fodder agents to probe. Fairly straightforward, just watch for EPPs (I can't stress that enough!)
