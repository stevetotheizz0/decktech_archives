title: Vader went down to Georgia...
side: Dark
date: 2001-04-07
description: Latest version of my Bring Him Before Me deck. Aggresive style compared to my previous ones. More about killin’ than turnin’ but if Luke falls to the darkside that’s just something I’ll have to live with.

Well there it is...

Tech/Combos:

Keep your beat squads in their own ranks if possible for best results. These are good group, but they don’t all need to be present. Each group has it’s own weapon or effect or destiny adder

WYS is huge in my area so I have a through screw retrieval over tech set up

Secret Plans-SSPFT-CHYBC

I also use Chimaera and Combat Deployment to kill the extra destinies

Turn the DS2 DB into a battle ground if you need one fast against WYS

The Rest is Self-Explainatory.

Note:

Using The Emperor with his power adds a destiny and two to attrition elsewhere

Stack your good destinies cause the average here is low but the potential for multiplies makes up for it

Don’t Go After Luke Unless Absolutely Needed or your sure you can turn him

Kill stuff and have fun!
