Strategy: '

Like always, start with the Main Power Generators and the North Ridge, then play The Signal and A New Secret Base. Draw for characters to control the three Echo sites and then play Echo Base Operations. While you establish EBO,	just stockpile systems that you get with A New Secret Base or have drawn and get the starships needed to control them. Dont deploy any of the systems, just stockile them until you have eight or so systems and starships in hand and then just deploy them all at once. Make sure you get a strong starship such as the Nebulon-B Frigate at the better system drains such as Kessel to protect it. Use Ice Storm to keep the Imperials from occupying Hoth. Stick Wedge and Wes in Rogue 3 with a Power Harpoon to take down any AT-ATs or chicken walkers. With Wedge and Wes on Rogue 3, you dont even really  need to draw a destiny to take down walkers Just use the Electrobinoculars to make sure you dont draw a location for destiny. Use Civil Disorder and Goo Nee Tay so your oponent will use more force each turn. Use the Interrrupts Hyper Escape and Houjix to help you out if you get into trouble with some big Star Destroyers or  Saber Squadron TIEs. The Golan Laser Battery can be stuck at the Power Generators to get rid of characters quite effectively. Let Captain Yutani man the battey and give him the Artillery Remote so he can keep safe and move around, and then he can fire it during your Control phase too. Just remeber to stockpile the starships and systems until your ready, and youll pound your opponent. This deck along with this strategy is great. I played a guy 5 days ago and I won with a drain of 38 Force As Homer puts it, Woo Hoo  '
