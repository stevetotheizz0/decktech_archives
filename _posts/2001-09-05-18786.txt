Strategy 

I´ve seen a lot of Dark Deal decks by decktech, and read many comments, and i read 
always the same sucking thing, dark deal is to slow, and you are not able to activate
enough force. Damn, that´s wrong, look at my strategy, first you deploy "Cloud City  Casino"
as your starting location, then you pull out with "I´m Sorry" 2 interior Locations, then search 
for The Docking Bay with Imperial Rest Order, and then use your Objective and deploy  
Bespin  Cloud City. now at the first turn you have pull out 4 Locations in the next turn you 
gonna activate over 10 force, only from your locations, in the second turn you deploy Bespin 
and then you always activate over 12 Force. DAMN that´s enough for an good and fast dark
deal player, just deploy "OS-72-2 In Obsidian 2" & "OS-72-1 In Obsidian 1" to Bespin  Cloud City
and try to control 3 loactions to play Dark Deal. Try to deploy "Aqualish" fast, cause he will rock asses
so the opponent must occupy 5 bespin locations to cancel dark deal, and that will be very hard.
Then try to pull out "Estrablish Control" and deploy it to the db now you gonna to drain over 10 every turn
and that will kill the opponent fast. Perharps you can play a Podracer [sebulba].

Thx to all who rate my deck, and if you have some awesome new ideas, tell me.
