Strategy: '

**New Note  Currently this deck is at 7-0, including beating decks that won the podrace and retrieved 10+**


A very simple deck, and fun to play  take over the senate with the many senators, and begin to play from there. If the opponent is using senators in their deck, it make take some effort to take over the senate, but Toonbuck Toora in a majority for 1 battle with give you control.


1st turn, possibly deploy 2 senators, Rendili, and a docking bay.

2nd turn, fortify senate, and draw.

3rd turn, establish control of senate and prepare to attack.


Once Flipped and controlling the senate, deploy out the 4 effects. This allows you game control. Also, deploy the 5 senators with ambition[listed in cardlist] to add 5 in attrition in each battle.


In battle, use the senators to make their destiny -3, yours +3, to possibly inflict up to 14 attrition per battle. Cancel drains via effect, but don’t add 2 to a drain unless a strange drain race occurs. Retrieve lategame with Squabbling Delegates.


The 5 ships should easily control space, as space decks average destiny is generally low. The Tatooine Maul is not used, as this deck’s battling capability is very great.


The deck is currently 4-0, and is fun to play, but probably not as fun to play against. Against podracing, it may have trouble, but should pull through after the race[or possibly even win with some luck].   '
