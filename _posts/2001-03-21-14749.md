Strategy: '

Playing Grab your generals, and pull the Home OneDB deploy crix and pull sergeant Brooks Carlson. Save your force and then next tuen pull your otheer docking bay and pull another scout. Deploy your scouts with Crix. and luke for -3. then transit them for free to the TatDB. Then darw a few and then next turn pull another scout and deploy him with Crix and Crew Then put down leia at the Chamber and if they started aliens of deployed someone there. Let them battle you otherwise free han. THen when they try to beatdown leia play dash and react enveryone over and play a jedi presense. Chop a character and let the damage flow, and if they cancel your react then play Houijx. Hard combo to pull off, but it’s a game winner. If your playing pure space just free han first turn and continue as a noral profit and drain and battle, the combo my come together at any time. Once you use it once they will be afraid to battle you and you can drain them out '
