k...This is my first ever submission and first ever Hidden Base Deck so lots of help with it please...


During Opponents turn go looking for General Calrissian if you didn’t get him in your starting hand.  If opponent is playing a deck where Honor will help right away sac Your insight right away and grab Honor...otherwise grab superficial damage...if you grab superficial don’t need to do it right away...grab it at your liesure...


1st turn Grab endor and look to see what’s in your deck...get a ship there right away...if you got luke or his ship or an all wings...go get him...otherwise get the general there...deploy any other systems in your hand except kessel...DON’T DEPLOY KESSEL TILL JUST BEFORE YOU FLIP...deploy goo nee tay or any other effects that might help right away...


2nd turn Grab another system...preferably in the order of aquaris, kiffex, kirdo III...get ships out as fast as you can and set up small drains...


Don’t leave yourself open to beat down...get the cannons out...the intruder missiles are if they are playin with capital starships...otherwise recycle with Traffic Control...


Mid Game should have 3 or 4 (depending on opponents space package) drains of 1 going and kessel in your hand...If opponent is playing something like LSC then get Kessel out and get draining...if they still have some space left hold on to it...battle plan will probably come out a lot with this deck and early as you’ll be able to afford it but they won’t...


Late Game Flip, Drain and Cancel...use the edge’s to retrieve...hopefully with a tracked 7...


Well my biggest concern is taking early damage against a deck like LSC and not being able to recover...I have next to no light side epp’s which is why i didn’t pack any ground package...


Anyway...any tips, criticism, help is very welcome with this deck...as i said it’s my first hidden base deck and my first submission so please help...thanks for reviewing '
