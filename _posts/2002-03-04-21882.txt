Strategy: '

The strategy for this deck isnt very complex. First I will go through the first couple of turns.

Turn 1 Deploy a system using your objective.  Preferably Dagobah because then you can take out Yodas Hut.  If you get a ship or pilot deploy it to rendavous point otherwise draw up.

Turn 2 You are now activating 6 plus.  Deploy another system Kashyyk if possible so there destiny drawing is inhibited by needing 6 ability.
Deploy ships and effects if you have any that will help. Draw force if you can.

Next few turns Deploy systems and ships.  Try to get Yoda to his hut.  Extra activation and subtracting 2 from attrition is always nice. draw if you have any.  Keep Draining

By turn 6 all of your locations should be out and you are activating 18 plus, not too shabby.  

Mid-game  Once you get at least 5 EPPs in your hand save force so that you can deploy all of them at the same time and you are able to battle.  You probably have a Slight Weapons Malfunction in your hand so use that in the battle also use Jedi Presence.  If your opponent has more characters than you use Desperate Times to fire a blaster repeatedly.  You should win the battle and hit some of their characters.  Hopefully they will have to lose about 15-20 force.  If you lose a character with a lightsaber use Resilience to get him back to kill again.  Dont forget to keep Draining

Late Game  Retrieve using On the Edge.  Keep draining and make little pot shots at their characters with your EPPs and Sorry About the Mess.  

Always remember to drain, cancel their drains and make them use force to draw force.
Also if they decide to go at you in space and probe systems. Use your X-wing cannon to get ride of their starfighters. Hopefully it is on Hobbies ship so it is a little cheaper.  Cancel their destiny with Wedge and if you recieve battle damage forfeit charcters and send them to the Tank.  If you lose more than one character remember you have Corran Horn as another pilot as well as Han if you get desperate but you shouldnt need to because of On the Edge.  

I know the Destiny average bites the big one and that is why I have destiny adders to try and even it out. '
