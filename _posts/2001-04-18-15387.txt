Strategy: '

Ok this deck is exparimental and has won we all my games so far. 

First tunt grab Shocking info and plat it every turn and grab it every turn so you have a 5 always at the bottem of your deck if you want to track it ever in the game.
well first off you want to get xizer to a battle ground and so you grab the 2 docking bays.
When he is there give him a body gaurd and look for a jabbas palce and throw down a scum on it.
Since all you cards all alians this is great
the rest of the game is just battle and deploy.
The Makurths are in there for the surprise.lol and the retreival. With Nigth time conditoins out they get insane
But the mane part of this deck is skum. I wanted this deck to be like MKOS but with a twist and i think i have done it 
Thank you for reading the deck. I HOPE YOU LIKE IT '
