Strategy: 

This deck uses retrieval to keep those high forfeit characters back in play. It doesn't have really high drain potential, but it can block out the opponent's drains very well, even if they do operatives, I can stop them (without A Bright Center). Star destroyers give me max power in space (combined with Lateral Damage and it could be nasty). Probe Droids w/ Restraining Bolts and/or 5D6 will take care of a lot of ground drains too. Please review this deck!
