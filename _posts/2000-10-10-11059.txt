Strategy: '

so i remember way back when joe alread says to me "hey man, just run 6x dark maneuvers" and i’m like "what the hell are you talking about?  i’m going to sit greedo in the cantina and play Res Luk Ra Auf, hoping to draw 2x 7 destinies"  so joe schooled me with his recycling 6’s, and i’ve been a fan ever since.  in fact this deck is a version of his SYCFA/big blue beatdown that he won the Virginia Grand Slam with.  we call it "the dark deck."

so i’m like WHOA this new Admiral’s orders card let’s me recycle 6 destinies without getting them sensed, grabbed, visored visioned, or whatever else...joh yawza...whatever...

so i’m runnin’ 8 of these monsters, and tracking 3 6’s with Igar and Emperor’s power is pretty cool...plus you can reliably duel luke.

"the deck" just outright loses to jedi testing decks, BUT i played it on day one of worlds...figuring ALL light side decks would either be Hidden Base or EBO.  so it worked...smeared all 4 of them..heh.

(just remember that you’re supposed to go to THEIR locations to fight)
