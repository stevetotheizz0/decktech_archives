Strategy: '

Errata  I actually shoudl have a Masteful Move in
here but I forgot to type it. Knock out one Evader
and use it when necessary.

General  Get your now insanely hard to get rid of
Vader to a Battleground site and knock heads with
the opponent. Start Crush the Rebellion and wear
the opponent down through battles.

Specifics 
Hidden Base  Start Security Precautions. Get
  Vader to a battleground site and try to keep the
  Visage damage on them. There is a lot of good
  ships and Dengar and the Bounty Hunter ships
  give you a good load to battle with. The deck
  gets good activation and usually has force to
  spare. There is only one Visage in the deck but
  it is just a side thing really. Lt. Pol Treidum
  may send some unwary spies into outer space.

Ops  Start Battle Order. Get Empire's New Order
set up as fast as possible and First Strike.
Use Vader and Tarkin and Igar and Tempest 1 to
harass the Ops. DON'T deploy to their battleground
system. Make them do that.ABC2theUniverse can get
set up and make them fight you. A real pain in
their plans is Fett in Slave 1 and Zuckuss in the
Mist Hunter. He can go up to the system and can't
be Landing Clawed or destroyed too easily. Takes a
lot of patience but will win out in the end.

Throne Room / Mains & Toys   Start Crush the
Rebellion. Set up at Cloud City and just beat them
down when they come , I Have You Now and
You Are Beaten are nasty. 4-Lom really helps clear
out resistance quickly.

Cards that make you go , ' Hmmm ' 
Captain Bewil - Shuts down Path of Least Resistance
- Also stops the opponent from running away on
Cloud City or the Executor ;Arconas or Mains.
Gets IAOrder bonus and is a nice 3 destiny.
