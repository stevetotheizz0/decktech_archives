Strategy: '

I have got the Objective and i play it

Normally start with Wise Advice so your grabblers deploy
for free (mostly for Torture) But you can start with BP or AFA aswell.
Your main goal is to do damage with Anger and with Never tell me.
Start to deploy the droids and insert NTMTO and AFA. Try to get a gifted
doid to the AC. Use the UC spies and the Projections to block your opp. drains.

Meanwhile try to establish a fleet on Kessel or on your opp.
systems to get some drains going. There are enough ships in
there and some cannons for those BH-Ships, so you can defend your position.
Obi and Master Luke are in there to hit your opp a little bit if
he spreads his forces or to free Han Solo for an easy retrieval.

I think thats it...grats to Bastian.....
