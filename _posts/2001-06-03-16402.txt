Your spread out your fleet at each system and use Admiral Piet to get Merjek out to get all your systems out and force drain.  You use the Tallon Rolls to make your opponent lose key starships, and cause some extra damage.  You make their swarming starfighters weak with Fighters Coming In, and give yours bonuses.  You use Combat response to get out the Blacks and their pilots.  You make their ships deploy +1 with Astromech shortage so their x-wings deploy for 3.  Then when you battle ,you mutalate them with all your power and Relentless Pursutes. You can also make their large starships weak with lateral damage. If you play lateral damage on a system that you controll with power, they are in trouble with their large ship. you can haras it as it tries to get to the system, and when it does, you crush it.  '
