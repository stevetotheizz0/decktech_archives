Strategy: '

You start with Staging area, Insurrection, and Your insights serve you well, to pull out Honor of a Jedi, And of course your starting site is Throne Room.


First turn you pull out home one docking bay or endor, to put the asp droids down. All you do is go to the docking bays, retreive when they come to you to battle play fallen portal.


Retreive, with On and Off the Edge, and also, you can get Our Most desperate hour going for added kicks, or atleast battle with the home one which ever you decide.


This deck is really cool, it lets you start, and it is the type of deck you wait to see what your opponent does and you go againts what he or she is doing.


Also Honnor of a Jedi is in there, I know some people play with no escape but still it helps big time, especially when they dont.


Try the deck it is fun as heck to play '
