***UMMM SWITCH A THERE'LL BE HELL TO PAY FOR A TRAMPLE.***


Well, I was looking through the binder and saw Rebel base occupation.  Decided it was time I used that card.


Ok basic start is the objective targeting yavin 4.  The LS will think somethings up just with that odd start.  Starting interrupt is Surface Defense and pull all the effects ( Resistance, Secret Plans and There Is No Try )

Basically the objective allows you to pull all the generic sites out so you can quickly set up for occupying.  The 2/0 sites are for extra force generation.

Now the drains aren't gross in here but if you get organa's necklace out cool, makes the drains bigger if not no biggy 'cause occupation should have them hurting pretty good.

Boring Conversation and Scruffy Looking Nerf Herder are in there to cancel the big destiny adders of the LS.

This deck only has restistance for numbers defense.  Mainly because it's not big in my area but you can easily substitute a torture in.

Now for against HB keep the ships together and you'll go far.

Profit deck.  If you need to deploy to him for beatdown.  Otherwise you should be able to do more to him than he to you.  Also endor occupation shuts down his tatooine celebration.

VS other objective decks just smart playing is called for.  If you stick to your game plan you should do good.

Against the EPP beat down just try to keep your power stacked if you fear it.  If it's really popular in your area put in wounded wookiee or 2.

I haven't play tested this deck too much because I haven't had much chance so i'm posting it here for suggestions.

Thanks for taking a look.
