Strategy: '

  Let me go through some card explanations before I hit the strategies against certain deck types.

Jabbas Prize  Takes Captain Solo away from those pesky WYS decks.  It also insures that Super Falcon wont be paying you a visit.


Why 2 4-Loms?  Quite frankley, because he enables you to flip the objective if you chose to do so.  He can escort popsicle Han nice and quietly for you.  


CZ-4  He stops reacts.  Plain and simple.  Nice Arcona and Patrol craft protection.  Destiny 4 to boot.


Stunning Leader  This took the place of an Imperial Barrier because everyone and their sister is playing with the Bith/Desperate Reach combo card.  It protects Pote against a mains bombardment.  It can also be used for a nice little beatdown if the light side deploys any scrubs with the mains horde.


Why CCT and not Mkos? Just so I can play inserts.  When this deck was first born, Profit was the huge light deck around and I was able to choke profit decks. (it had 2 tatjps then) The force this thing generates has always been enough to get it going.  Plus, when your flipped, all your little skrillings and ships are immune to attrition less than 4.  


  Against WYS  Stay indoors for your drains and take over the Tatooine system as soon as you can.  This is pretty easy considering that they cant throw the Captain in the Falcon against you.  When you get CZ-4 into hand, pick your battle outdoors.  Save your grabbers for Fallen Portals and Harvests.  Inserts will hurt MOST WYS decks.  


  Against HB Mains.  None Shall Pass and Stunning Leader are key to beating this deck.  Set up Pote and a few skrills in the AC as soon as possible and dig for one of your savior cards.  Sence you Say?  That doesnt exist in any decent light deck anymore.  As long as your doing more damage than your opponent.....leave his mains on the table.  If you kill them off, new ones will just come at you.  If he starts to spread thin, thats when you hit them with 4 skrills, DrE and Vader with Stick.  


  Speeders  Used to be an auto loss, but the addition of CZ-4 gives you a chance.  Drain indoors and hit them hard when you get the opportunity.  Kashyyyk and Battle Order are very important against this deck type. 


  HBX  If this is prevelent in your area, take out a skrilling and add Security Precautions.  Its not in my current deck because I havent seen a flipping HB deck in months.  Dengar in Punishing One and his friends can easily take care of this problem.  Especially if your objective is flipped.  All those ships of yours will be immune to less than 4.  


  This deck has been very solid for me over the past year.  I won states with it, went 4-0 at GenCon with it, and went 2-2 at the Phoenix MegaSlam in which I took 3rd.  The 2 losses came to Clint Hays (speeders) and Kyle Craft (mains and about 15 destiny 6s) Overall the deck has a cumulative record of about 27-3.  Its not for everybody......but then again, not everybody likes cheeze.  


  Editors note 3/5/01  In my area, I havent seen a grimmtash in ages.  Thats a pure Meta call.  Although, when Ive played this deck in other areas (GenCon and the MegaSlam in Phoenix) I did add Well Guarded to the deck.  Those of you who pointed that out, Well Guarded is probobly a good call......but in my opinion, when you play cheese, thats the chance you take.  

  For those of you who keep asking via email, Kevin Shannon was the other person who beat this deck. (sorry for ommiting you bro)


  Editors note 3/29/01  Some of you have brought up that Insight destroys this deck.  You cant be more wrong.  If Insight is on the table, this deck is plenty strong enough to overpower almost anything.  At GenCon, all 3 of my opponents started the game with insert protection and I was able to win all 3 games.  Heck, if anything, when your opponent starts with Insight, you know that you have 4 cards to use for force drains.....the numbers does not make the deck, they just make it a hell of a lot meaner.  


Editors note 3/31/01  I’ve been asked a few times via E-mail why I use IAO.  Plain and simple....because Nebruning Mains absolutely DESTROYS this deck.  Even though Nebrun Leids doesn’t get much play anymore, thats a chance I’d  rather not take.  If you’d rather go Mob Points and replace Kashyyyk with Rendilli or one of the other systems....go for it.  This is just my personal choice.  When someone builds (copy’s) a deck off Decktech, you shouldn’t build it card for card.  Add your own flavor so it fits your playing style.  Whatever makes the deck easier for you to play, also makes it easier to win with.
