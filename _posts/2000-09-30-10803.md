Strategy: '

Take out yavin 4 and any other card you don’t like to put in another docking bay <> and Tatooine Celebration. Put the docking bay at tatooine and start retreiving 2 a turn.






This is just an idea that i had so don’t rate it to harshly.
First turn pull dagobah and yodas hut to get the activation going then pull tattoine and put the docking bay there repeat with aldaran. From then on out just start draing at the docking bays with I’ll take the leader out plus you can do some retreiving with Our Most Desprate hour[2 for every force sensitive character on the table and jedi 1 for every force attuned character on the table].
   If you want to no how to retreive it is pretty simple put the effect at aldaran targert a rebel at tatooine docking trancit to the aldaran site then on your next turn trancit him to a ship located at aldaran and retrieve force.If you want you can also use on the edge it’s pretty easy to get a high destiny to track because you can cancel your own admiral order to get a 6 back in the deck then track it and play on the edge to retreive 5.Deck looks good to me please don’t just say it sucks i’m just trying new things.
