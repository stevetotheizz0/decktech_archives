Strategy: '

   The basis of this deck is to get a good quick base of ability 4 characters at each of your sites. then, your opponent should feel the hurting. if they attempt to come and battle you, just use projective telepathy, then weapon levitation if you can. this should handcuff thier power and let you win the battle. if you end up losing horribly, then your new favorite card is ghhhk. 

   this deck should be able to go the distance late game because of the high number of characters and starships. It will also have high average destiny by then. even so, i can see a few weaknesses with it. give it a rate, and give a poor fellah some advice

    Remember that dark deal is definetly making a comeback. Enjoy '
