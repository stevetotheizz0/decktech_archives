Strategy: '

Hmmmm, ISB choke really isn't a good title anymore due to Staging Areas. Okay, ISB Effects/Beats, a wussier title but oh well. basically what you're looking to do is get ot twix and out-activate your opponent as best as possible. From there, get out whatever effect your opponent deck calls for. Numbers? YCHF. EBO? Decree. Profit? BDC. And so on. The key is surprise, the sudden nullifying of your opponent's strategy leaves them scrambling and you smiling Also, Terminal is key for battle. Track your 6s and Visage eary on, making Trample and Choke even deadlier. Ben Kenobi? Draw that Visage and choke him Not easy, but totally do-able.Finally, First Strike has won me so many games I can't count them. I find the surprise of it just kills your opponent So don't deploy it until you're ready to battle, and do not, DO NOT lose it on purpose because you think your opponent is too strong, it always comes in handy.'
