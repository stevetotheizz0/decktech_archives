I know this deck might look like a pile, but trust me, it works.

Start with The Main Power Generators, North Ridge, 

Heading For The Medical Frigate, Your Insight Serves You Well, 

Strike Planning, Scrambled Transmission, and An Unusual Amount Of Fear.

On your first turn, activate 3 and search for a Shocking Information & Grimtaash (via Scrambled Transmission). This will ensure the oppurtunity to search through your deck every turn (by cancelling the scomp link, then searching again), and can also be used to prevent Commander Merrejk from pulling systems for the opponent. If you can force them to hang around your systems, you have the advantage of knowing what bonuses you get and where you can go, etc. You have 6 cards that can search for A New Secret Base 

(3x We Wish To Board At Once, 3x The Signal), so you should get one in your opening hand and get your jump start with the effect. Pull your 2 generals (Madine and Rieekan), and you already have enough to play Echo Base Operations. Use the two generals, and an X-Wing at the docking bay to play EBO, and then consolidate your ground forces under the sheild. Drain in space, harass them on the ground with the mains, and just apply the general beats..


Specific card uses


Colonel Cracken you can pull him with Madine, and drop him as an Undercover spy.


Jar-Jar you know, heâ€™s just good at taking care of characters. With Brisky Morning Munchen and all your other mains, you should be able to maintain a strong presence on the ground.


Leia, RP play her wherever the opponent is blowing his load, so you can delay him even more.. your drains in space will overcome them eventually.  '
