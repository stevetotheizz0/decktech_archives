Strategy

Somehow I keep coming up with decks that are easy to play and require not a lot of strategy ). Use your
characters to crush your opponent and after you release Han do the cantina shuffle to maximize damage
Yeeh, let me see what else can I tell you about this deck, ah yes Threepio is the man in the deck Low deploy
(see objective), great forfeit, great gametext and well it is just cool to see Chewie repair Threepio over and
over again using another cool card Were you looking for me?

Be careful with Han, stick him along with Ben at interior sites if you expect beatdown or trample stuff
Although drain potential is very limited, the damage that you can cause with the objective is amazing.

Most of the interrupts speak for themselves, although some more Anti HDADTJ maybe required.

If people start with aliens, just beat them down
Free master Luke along with one other character can easily be accomplished in the first turn

Against ops start battle plan	'
