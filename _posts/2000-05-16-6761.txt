Strategy: 

that a super falcon deck...train only if its necessary and train a random 4 ability character.
battle with luke and obi on ground, retrieve with DTF and put it on the thank and repeat next turn, for space use super duper falcon
against duel give vader a fury and go elsewhere.
against insert use it could be worse
against ralop fight when it necessary and drain at kessel and let the direct damage give him a headache
against anything else ....win!
