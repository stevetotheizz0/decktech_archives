Strategy: '

The main strategie is to block ground drains with Undercovers, drain in space and retrieve Agents.
Most LS decks almost got nothing against Undercover Spies.

The startegies are pretty standard. Just use your cards wisely.

The problems with this deck are
- low power gen. (Force Choke decks are difficult).
- Few Battlegrounds so I have to use Torture
- The Super Falcon is always difficult without Tallon Rolls.

If you think this deck misses some cards, you should also know which should go.
