Strategy: '

If you can’t figure out how to play this deck you should stop @#$%in playin the damn game period.

***-1 for the strategy. I am here to learn things about decks, not be insulted by the strategy section. -.25 because I think you should drop the podrace, although it looks like you have something in their for it. -.25 because you have little SAC protection and because I think you do not generate enough force, and you give your opponent a lot of force. You have had much better. 

thanks norite for the review

when you get a chance go read the @#$%in objective you dumbass  

***im gonna leave lbmyers’ review up so everybody can see what a dumbass he is...thanks paul for reviewing my brangus deck...ya jackass


***Whats the Matter Hayes. Are you too much of a @#$% to leave my reviewas up??? Or is it that your embarrased becuase i am @#$%ting on you????? I thnk it was the Second. 
Come just leave this one up so everyone knows that I made you my @#$%.

well @#$% me...i mean how can i even hope to contest a player who has won 3 opens in a row and a regional qualifier to boot...not to mention a dpc a grand slam and countless other large events...oh wait...you havent won any of those things...so shut your @#$%in mouth ya jackass


***there are much better versions of WYS podracing. I dont think you have enough race interrupts to win against a dedicated DS podracing deck
