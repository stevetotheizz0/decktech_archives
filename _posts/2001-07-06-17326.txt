*********************FINAL UPDATE**************************
Ok I changed my mind...WYS still kicks all kinds of a.ss. Asmuch trouble as the senate should give it....it still kicks a.ss. Im seeing it beat good senate decks consistently. And by the way....Defensive shields dont do jack s.hit against this deck...There are hardly any interrupts to play from the lost pile so anyone who says defensive shields kill this deck is a complete idiot.
****** Update*************

After seeing the reviews...everyone seems to think His Name is Anakin is some sort of special card or something. Ive never seen it played in a deck in my area so who cares about it? I have 4 non unique aliens in the deck. BIG DEAL. If you want to waste that card slot in your dark deck then by all means go for it. That could be a card that will help you win games instead of hoping someone is not playing elom swarm or some other s.hitty deck type. If I have to spend 2 more for my raiders...they are still well worth it. Also...try reading the strategy before you rate the deck. Ive seen some reviews that just made me laugh from people who dont know anything about the game. Be objective. The deck wins and is very consistent. No deck is perfect but saying things like your character selection is horrible is just stupid. Hello idiot its a smuggler deck...its got a bunch of smugglers in it. Who else would you have me put in? How bout Qui Gonn...Harc Seff...while were at it lets put in Darth Vader. duh!!

************************Strategy Update*********************
Mad props to Jeff Holmes...Steven Michael and the rest of the Atlanta monkeys who helped design this deck. How could I forget you guys? Sorry!!


Also after further review... I took some good advice and put in Jabbas Palace...Intruder Missle...xwing cannon....power pivot...direct assault...and fallen portal.The cards I took out were Artoo...A Gift...JP Audience Chamber...Lukes saber...1 Mess...and effective repairs. Im constantly working on the deck to try to make it better and it is so hard to make card choices so Im doing it my meta. Dont you wish they were 70 card decks.

I took out Lukes saber because of the constant threat of weapon lev that seems to be in every dark deck I play right now and although it adds to drains it is a one destiny which I loathe. Also had a hard time taking out effective repairs but the retrieval in the deck is pretty good so for now Ill play with out it.

JP is tech against Mauls Hutt and scum decks so they cant pull the sites..works with fallen portal...and is another outdoor site which I prefer for the raiders. Direct assault is super tech against executor type decks or Chiamera Thrawn Guri setups. It cancels the immunity. Power pivot makes ships power zero and I prefer the intruder missle and cannon so I should always have a weapon hanging around.
*****************END UPDATE*******************************
This deck is a machine when up and running and it does not take long to get it going.

Start seeking an audience. This can pull 3po..r2..and underworld contacts. Once you get the droid (preferrably 3po) to the scomp link then you can start messing. How did we get into this mess brings the deck out very quickly. Mess for effects and sites and deploy as you go. Grabbers dont mean s.hit. Ive only needed to mess a few times with it so far. 3po takes care of that. This character is amazing. Throw back what you dont need and keep on drawing till you get what you need. Add in Mirax for extra drawing and tracking and you have a track masters wet dream.
3po should stand alone until chewie and another smug can hang out with him. This is 3 destinies...4 if its han or a raider in a craft.

Deploy your sites as you get them because they all help in the deck. Outskirts pulls Ben or Luke. Mos Eisley lets you do the cantina shuffle and the audience chamber lets artoo do his gifty thingy against court or scum or other alien stuff.

Maul is a beast you say? Well of course he is. Thats why you need Melas in a patrol craft with a raider. Who the hell wants to fight that? 3 destinies and you cant hit anything and they forfeit for a billion. Its not even fair.

Battle deployment and guri are the only things that stop that and you gots to get them on the table. The destiny in the deck is nice and high on average so that can usually take care of most big nasties the dark side throws your way.

Ben Kenobi costs 11. Thats alot right. Right but he is worth every red cent. Whats worse than a palace raider forfeiting for 8?? A palace raider that forfeits for 8 and gets revived by Ben. ouch

This deck is a great matchup for any dark jedi type deck. Two smugs can kick a.ss on the big nasties especially if Talon is hanging around making them feel all beefy. You cant beat everything so a well placed choke or force lightning is bad news but isnt it always? Cant choke a patrol craft now can ya? Fear dueling? Stick ol Puke in a patrol craft and draw 2 destiny. Reacting for free to all of the outdoor sites is stupidly good also. Han by himself gets jumped by Vader and Xixor (or whatever). Patrol craft with chewie and a raider reacts from up to 3 sites away for free and that o destiny just became 4 destiny. wow

Underworld contacts gets pulled from reserve...adds 1 force gen and keeps drains from being cancelled. cool

Pod racing: Im sure everyones agrees that pod racing is a little wierd. Some people like it Im sure and I know a lot of people hate it. However...its a weapon we cant ignore. This version of podracing is almost unbeatable. The only way to beat it is to have lots of interrupts in your own deck and I mean collisions up the cazoo to try to stop anakin. A step backward in a wys is the best defense. It puts the top race destiny of both racers back in the used pile. Well...lil annie always draws 2 right? Sebulba only draws 1. If you get ahead in the race you cant lose if you have the interrupt to play of course and you are flipped because you get to play up to 6 times. It drags the race out a long time also which usually is an advantage to light side. You can also decide when to play the step backward which can stick a 1 back in their deck and a card you can pull back in yours. Lots of tricks there. The key is to wait to pull I did It until you are ready to win the race. You can only pull it once per game and messing will stick it back in your deck. Oh...did I mention you draw an extra card because of 3po when you mess? Did I mention he is good?

The retrieval is straight forward. Grab on to tatooine and hold on tight so you may retrieve. You already retrieve 10 if you win the race so slow retrieval is better. This deck originally had harvest and owen/beru but that was wasteful.

It is undefeated so far and has beaten some really good decks but Im still tweaking it. I may drop the saber for another admirals order and the gift/artoo chamber stuff might be able to go for another strategy like more ships or weapons/power pivot. Its easy to switch out these things. Play what your area calls for. The gift came in real handy last weak against a tatooine alien/imperial deck.

matchups:

Walker garrison- isnt this tough against everything? How do you deal with the direct damage? Menace fades and take hoth and hold it. If garrison is popular near you use the cannons and power pivot tech instead of a gift.

Dark Deal- Please...those decks are gay...especially the really cheesy ones and menace fades eats there lunch.

Scum decks- Underworld contacts ruins there day and a gift makes it worse.

Ties- havent seen a tie deck lately but the drains on the ground are pretty good and should keep pace with them.

Black Sun- Is anyone still playing this deck? I know it was awesome but can it podrace? Can it handle raiders and crafts? hmmmmm

Raltiir- Not many of these around either but they are always tough. Raiders and crafts and snatch the system quick should be big.

Thats all I can think of...Like I said before...Its real tough against hunt down...heavy mains and toys decks...and aliens. Its fun to play and can be adapted easily to other meta types. Start realizing how incredibly good C3PO is.
