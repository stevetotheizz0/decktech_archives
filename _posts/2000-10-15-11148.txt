Strategy: '

ok, here it is
Free Han, Protect Han, Destroy those who try to hurt Han, and...

Ok, for those of you who think I have no activation, if I get people to Toche Station I’ll have plenty, and I don’t need any twix locals. Also I can drain for enough force, once I flip it. I don’t like a lot of locals though, because they are destiny-0 floating around my deck.

I don’t have any more Bens, Master Lukes, or any more of those good cards. I also don’t want to remove C-3PO, he’s a good part of my deck, and is used for a lot of things. As for the starships, I think they’re good. I don’t have GL in G1 in because I don’t think he’s that good. R2 in R5 is in partly because of the destiny, and partly because I wanted a good ship, with room for a pilot, incase I play a space deck(and it’s better than GL in G1).

The weapons I think are ok, the sabers allow me to drain for more. I don’t have Luke’s though.

As for the interrupts and Effects, this is where I think I could use the most help. I plan to use Someone Who Loves You to free Han, and a lot of my interrupts to protect him(Solo Han is for worste case scinerio). I also try to get Artoo with A Gift on him ASAP so I can cut down on drains. I hope this is good enough for thise of you who gave me two stars just because I had no strategy(personally, I though the strategy was a little obvious, it is just following an objective) but still.
