Strategy: '

***Just a note, I have had Darth Vader OOC'd 3 times against good players, and pow won all three.  Plus Evader can cause him not to go to the lost pile.  Bam

Starting Info-
Ops- Battle Order
Yavin IV Throne Tech- Crush
Tatooine Drain- Crush
Against mostly everything else- Start IAO

The idea is to get Vader down to a battleground with I Have You Now in hand waiting for characters to come down.  Let Visage do the damage whenever possible.  When you get Put All Sections in hand, Drop a Tempest Scout at the D*DB and just drain for one until they come at you.	When they do, Trample who you can and then let IG and Dengar come down and beat on who ever is left.  Duel when you feel confident with your destinies. Against speeder beatdown Ops (ala Clint Hays style)  Wait for the right moment to strike with Vader, Dengar (to pick off 2 speeders at a time) and a swoop.  Against HB X Wing, drop Vader to the D*DB, flip Hunt Down then move to the Med Chamber for Space.  With the Bus and Res Luk Ra'auf defending a battle you can draw 4 destinies and subtract 2 from each of the opponents  If need be you can drop a Bounty Hunter Ship on the ground because they can still draw destiny (Zuckuss-4 ability) normally or with help.  The Counter Assaults are for late game weenie drains for large losses or with ground drains with 5+ characters.  When playing against Revos, do not play an Evader unless they have out 2 revo's or the opponent has <3 force saved up and no Wise Advice out to prevent grabbers.  Don't forget that Put All Section lost can let you retrieve into hand the Death Star locations if you lose them.  Good Luck
