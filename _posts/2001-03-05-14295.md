Strategy: '

This deck whilst a dominator of Walker Garrison style decks (of which there are a few floating around) it can still be a pain to others. if they come to beat up on hoth react and beat the @#$% out of them (be sure to shoot them too). use t-47 battle formatoin and bye bye with a drain oâ€™ 12 and 4 of them in there it can be nasty. But when you find one beat the crap out of then pay out on the loser who made the deck. Basically you pull out the characters with the starting effect and put them on their speeders. Put 1/3 at 4th marker, 2 at 3rd and 4 at 2nd. Also put a portable power generator on the troopers and put them at 3rd marker (two here) and 2nd marker. Also put the atgars and golens at the 3,2,1 markers. If your opponent uses speeder bikes the beat up on one of them. Any walkers your opponent uses will be automatically be tripped with the harpoons (if there on rogue 1 or 3 with gunners) and that makes em power=zero hahaha then shoot them with the atgars. When they are tripped they are really useless, power zero, armour 2, any people on it have no ability and have no game text.     '
