Strategy: '

Basically, I do not Flip so it doesn’t matter who my Rep. is 

(Usually I say Ephant Mon or Ak-Rev). First Turn

I Get The Audience Chamber And depending on how much 

Force my opponent gives me Ephant Mon and Ak-rev 

With Hutt Influence and Audience Chamber. If I don’t get 

enough Force to play both, I will wait till next turn

to deploy anyone and I’ll just draw some. As soon as Ak-Rev is out, 

I will start drawing musicians out of my reserve deck and fortifying

the Audience Chamber, hopefully getting Gallid, A pressance 

or 2 or Maul or Mara with stick in there to boost the drain

Vader never goes in to Jabba’s Palace so I don’t cancel

My None Shall Passes. The musician retrieval comes 

in handy to get back Maul Strikes (the 2 Weapon Levs are supposed to be strikes

but I am having problems getting them.) or Monnok.

After I set up, I bassicaly just try to force drain you to death.

Any suggestions would be appreciated. '
