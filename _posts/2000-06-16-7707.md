Strategy: '

Well this is my first attempt at the new Dark side objective, from the 3rd anthology. I think with the new light side effects, everyone will be playing EBO. This kinda made up my mind on not flipping this objective, It is just too hard - for example there are 6 sites on hoth and the light occupies 3 of your DS-locations - so even if you drew a 7 destiny you will have to minus the 9 from your total. I know there are ways to do it, but it may not be that viable. So here's the breakdown of my cards and  a general strategy. Basically get out your DS sites right away, meanwhile track your planets. The DS Docking bay is your battle ground site, for Battle plan (order,whatever) - and with the text of the obj, you take no battle damage on the Death star. So you wanna just start getting out your starships asap and do some draining. Most of my effects and interrupts are defensive. I'll give you a few examples "put all sections on alert" cancels the game text of one rebel on the Death Star and that rebel may not use his ability to draw battle destiny - so Obi comes down to battle vader - fine play all sections - he can't draw battle destiny and you take no battle damage on the deat star**Pretty sweet**. "Tarkins Orders" cancels a force drain on the ground, if you control the planet system. I'll give you a breakdown on	a few of  the effects. "alert my star destroyer" deploy on a star destoyer if you Moff or admiral shuttles aboard, and that star destroyer becomes immune to attrition **not bad** ."Pride of the empire" this is why I stored the lone Tie in this deck, I hope to win a battle with the tie in it - and then play this immediate effect. Like if I was to fight a battle with bossk in bus and a imperial and the Tie - I'd forfeit the imperial, throw bossk on return to base - and play "pride of the empire" - (for all you who don't know what this effect does, I'll explain it to you - if you just won a battle in which the opponent lost a starship, place this effect on your tie, at each of opponents move phases he loses a force (2 if your tie is a tie/in) - so I am thinking of making it Black 2 or black 3. ----- So as you can see, this deck is more of a battle and kinda drain deck - that can compete with the EBO - -- Please let me know what you think, If I should drop some cards - what should i replace it with - drop me a message if you have the time - thanx   - p.s go easy on the review, I don't really know what this objective is capable of yet.'
