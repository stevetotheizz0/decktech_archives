Strategy: '

okay...it’s time to convince everyone that this deck works.  it took 2nd place at my Test of the Emerald Champion tournament.  basically you start gaining honor from bringing out dudes, then you attach alot of free followers, and play sneak, stand, and scout for deadly ground or night battle.  you deny them of battle actions.  woopdy doo.	nothing really special, but i HATE those damned decks that sit there and stall all game, and in the Strict Jade environment there are a TON of them.  BSL, SS, Fugees, T&D, favor, etc...the list goes on...OH and entrapping terrain.  i hate that sh1t.  so if you run into an honor runner, then you’ve got imperial ambassadors.  hopefully, kuro will let you refuse enough of his duels so that you can shoot his defenders, and then Come One At A Time should be avoided at all costs.  sneak deadly...nuff said.
