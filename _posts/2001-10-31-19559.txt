Strategy: 

--Response to reviews--
*Ion Cannon - good points but I have reasons.  Gailid was one of my 61st cards, but with honor out he would only be making a difference of 2 each drain max, so he wasnt as important.  Spaceport DB is cool b/c their transit is so expensive and their pilots deploy +1.  Plus, my starfighters deploy -1 lol.  Well, maybe that part isnt so useful... ;)

-------------------------------------------------------
This is a Battle Deck.  No way around it.  Battle the crap out of the opponent, and it doesnt matter if they have defensive shields.  THERE IS NO DEFENSIVE SHIELD THAT WILL SLOW THIS DECK DOWN.  The mains from the R3 will be cut down just as fast as normal mains.

 Basically make sure they dont get anyone on tatooine and you will win anyway.  The direct damage from the objective, S&D, and A,A,A will whittle them down, as well as beating the crap out of whatever characters they have.  

 Since R3 is generally an anti-non reactive enironment, this deck is meant to be reactive. If they feel like being non reactive, they will lose heavily to my effects and objective.

 Honor is not a problem, as No Escape cancels its effects on all necessary cards.
 Hutt Influence protects against things like Lost in the Wilderness and Suprise Assault.

  EBO 
Possibly a hard matchup with the new effect, but if you work fast enough to get the effects out and get guys moving onto hoth to cancel EBO it shouldnt be too bad.  The independent ships should allow you to get a few good battles in. 

 PROFIT 
Shouldnt be too hard.  With Chall Bekan out, who can pull CC engineer, the AC will be reverted and used once again for the purpose of evil.  The direct damage will get to them too.

 WYS
Actually, this is not too much of a threat, believe it or not.  With Jodo and Tarkin to cancel destinies and the 2 anti retriever effects as well as direct damage and powerful mains of my own, this should be a fairly straightfoward win.  Zuckuss should take care of mirax, or any raltir freightor captains, and should be able to hold position with other backup.
Why Didnt You tell me? is al;so nice to help take out luke.

 MWYHL
Broken Concentration stops this in its tracks.

 PODRACING
Hopefully sebulba can pull somehting off here :)

 QMC 
Possibly the hardest matchup.  But due to plenty of mains, pucumir and any other mains should die quickly.  QMC space isnt all that strong either in general.  The Court obj will constantly hurt them, ability ability ability is sometimes useful, but S&D is unfortunately almost useless as they have planty of batlegorunds.

 Well there ya have it. I will try to adress strat questions as they come up.

Thx for you reviews
