Strategy: '

Starting Start Hidden Base, Rendezous Point, and Corellia as you Indicator. Use HFTMF to start Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Menace Fades, or Do or Do Not & Wise Advice if you suspect SAC. 


Playing Pull your docking bays and systems and get you characters down for an early drain, then Beat them down wherever they are, and make them lose tons to battle Damage. If you lose any force retrieve it and you should win. 


This deck is brand new so I don’t know the matvhups, but they will be added after I tak ethis to the Vegas DPC
