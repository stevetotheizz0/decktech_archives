Strategy: '

I do not use the DS 2 obj because I don&#8217;t like it. When reviewing my deck remember strike planning = no force for opponent at endor. I have 2 graaks and Kazaks because they are key cards to drain +1 and off the top. I have Teebo cause he adds 1 to my ewoks forfeit. Logray for adding 1 to my destany. I am using Yub-Yub cause it adds to the forfeit and I can retrive anything with ewok in the title. I use spearmen cause I like the free spear on them. The spears for the power = 0 to the power people. And daughter cause for adding 1 Icon for me. Madine to pull Chewbacca and him to pull wuta to pull my sites. Anger Fear Aggression to get my opponent to come to endor where he will under estermate me or just lose 4. '
