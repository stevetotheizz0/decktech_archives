Strategy: 

This is basically how to play the deck pull Docking Bays to start activating force use mobilization points to Pull Carida.Alter Honor Of the jedi as soon as possible alot of time they start With Your Insight When they see Hunt Down and they dump it as soon as possible even if the don't occupy a battle ground so on the second turn Maby first I just plop down vader flip And alter The thing.Secret Plans Realy hurts Retreiving Decks.
Masterful Move and put all sections on alert are there to track and win duals with.It's worse is in cause lots of people in my area play it could be worse plus it is destiny 6.Use Hutt smooch to get rid of the pesky undercover spies.
