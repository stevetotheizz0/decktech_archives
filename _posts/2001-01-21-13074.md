Strategy: '

Ok, well, to start, you use Prepd Defenses to pull Imp. Decree, IAO, and Mob. Points.  Imperial
decree is nifty because it cancels bonuses, IAO lets you pull your docking bays, which give you
massive activation with mob. points, and lets you satisfy honor.  Mob points is there to let you
get lots of force, and also get rendili or executor if needed.

Ok, so, try to drop Vader at DS docking bay. ALso, drop All Sections when you get it to protect
him.  At the other docking bays, drop a few chars. and try to always leave force for imp. barriers
(niftier than most think).  Other than that, play like most other HD decks, and if opp.  trys to get
you battle, then by all means, go battle.  THis deck has more than enough power to destroy opp.

Heres some reasons for some cards

HothEcho DB and Yavin DB work with Imp. Decree.

Death Star DB put all sections on alert

Jabba ability 4, works with Boelo

Janus and Sim Aloo  Need I say more.  Those two, plus Emporor, can hold most sites.  An extra
destiny, extra drains, and great for tracking destinies.

Grand Moff Tarkin Do the words No Destinies sound good to you?

Evazan Numerous ways to operate (disarmed, hitting with  sabers.)

Mara Jade Awesome with Emporor, Awesome without Emporor

Blizzard 2 Helps fortiffy ground, works well in variety of situations

Ok, well, hope you liked my deck.  Dont be too hard on me, since this is only my second  deck
posting.  Thanks Alot '
