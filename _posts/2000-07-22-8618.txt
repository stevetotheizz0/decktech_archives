Strategy: '

For those of you who have never seen a Tessek Deck, it is a deck based around draining.  I have now included Battle Plan to counter battle order, only play it if needed to cancel out battle order. Otherwise recycle it with Traffic Control.
Nar Shadda and Arleil all help get out non unique aliens to get Tessek working.  Sense counters sniper, Bo Shuda and Uh-oh keep them from beating down on Tessek.



AGAINST COTVG
Not as hard as it would seem.  Draw to make sure you have Tessek, uh-oh, Bo Shuda, and Traffic Control.  Then set up and recycle extra cards.  Disarming creature is just the harshest card against court, ecspecially with the extremely high destinies in this deck - 30 cards destiny 4 or more, with few 0s and 1s.
use Obi Wan and luke to battle, and you should win.
WHAAAOOOW is just the funniest card to use against court)
probably a win

AGAINST ISB
Just drain faster than them and you will be ok.  Use Boushh to get on Couruscant and funny things start to happen.
Eloms are perfect to beatdown on those low power ISB imps.
usually a win

AGAINST NUMBERS
Your insight Serves you well pretty much solves THAT problem.
pssshhht with that effect out what can they do?

AGAINST SYCFA/TUPITU
this is where you can use battle plan - it works both ways.  Make sure you are draining bigger than they are.
Bargaining table is just the harshest card agianst this deck.
usually a win

AGAINST HUNT DOWN
Tranmission Term
Slash Vader before he can duel
drain a lot
use Boushh to get on Executor and cancel visage and then drain.
use eloms to beat down on Vader and Mara
tricky but a win can be pulled off (barely)

AGIANST RALTIIR OPS
OK this is hard
just drain big and when you battle battle with a lot of stuff
try to get some guys on Raltiir
probably a loss depending on how good they are but not necessarily it is possible to beat

AGINAST OPS
just beatdown on the ops and drain them on their planet.
probably a win



PLZ do not say activation is a problem it has not been ever I make do with what I have
Kal fanl Cndros is harsh in that the destiny is so high in this deck.
Rennek is anti bubo and is a nice power booster
Luke*s speeder b/c it has a better destiny than skiff and lower deploy higher forfeit.	It can still react and is fun to use when Luke is driving.
R. Point is activation
the drain potential may not get too high on tatooine but a lot of this deck is going to their sites and draining
I have not played the new D*II obj so plz give me tips on how to counter it
Plz tell me what to take out not just what to take in
Thx for your time
