Strategy: 

You always start with First Strike. Draw till you get Jabbas Palace, which takes up to 3 turns usually. Get out the AC, and get the musicians rolling. They have a lot of power and retrival.
This deck retreives a TON. Every time a musician is deployed to Rysital it is 1 force. 3 force ( Scum n Villany/First Strike) per battle, ISB gets you agents, and Ornament retrieves a maximum of 7. Against HB, get out Sec. Precuations and go a probing. Use ORS as pilots. They are forfeit 5, so you will only lose 1 a battle with precautions out. Once you find there base make sure to have a ghhk before you start probing, this is important. This deck works, try it if you have doubts.
