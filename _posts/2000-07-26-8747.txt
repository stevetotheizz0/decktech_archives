Strategy: '

This deck plays like a trm deck. you start off with local uprising on endor. you also start of with heading for the mediacl frigate to take out squadron asignments, strike planning, and your insight serves you well. from there you get nudj's out and you get some ships at endor to drain. then you just batle them out on the ground. meanwhile you've got asp droids setting up destiny's for either on the edge or to shoot emporer or lord vader or even to sense and fail to get your diff up. i don't know what else to say. it's gone 4-0 so far(the regionals) and would of beat steve brenston by more if had not drawn up.

any comments or suggestion you have before you want to reveiw it just dmail me.
