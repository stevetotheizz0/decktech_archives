Strategy: '

Use Oola to scan thier hand and keep those horroble Vaders and those big imperial generals and captians out of reach. You should get these effects out as soon as possible and then beat 'em down with the charecters. The obis cape is there because most of these charecters do not have immumity to attrition (you should probably give the cape to obi w saber or Luke). There are a few recycleable destinies that should be combined with some of the Courage of a Skywalker or Glancing blow if they do manage to get Vader past Oola. This deck should win easily if you play it correctly and get the right effects out fast.  '
