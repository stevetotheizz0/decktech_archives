Strategy: '

THis deck has done ok in tournaments, it wins about half of the games it plays.  Get Kessel into hand 1st turn and get set up in the Cantina.  Meanwhile, start racing.  With 21 cards with 4+ destiny, winning the race should not be a problem.  While racing, one of the other systems should pop up.  Deploy that and the game should be within your grasp.  Battle where possible, using the flip side of the obj. to add battle destiny.  


Oh, one last thing... I’ve Got a Bad Felling about this is a nice surprise card, especially effective when used with multiple destiny adders (and if Han is in the battle... )
