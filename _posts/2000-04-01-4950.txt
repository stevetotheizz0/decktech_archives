OBJECTIVE:
Court of the Vile Gangster/
I Shall Enjoy Watching You Die



Strategy: 

	  First use ttw'lek to get all wrapped up as your starting effect and get your bounty hunters to capture their characters as soon as possible to flip your objective quickly.(If they nabrun, oo-ta goo-ta, Solo? will be very useful)
     Next, try to use things like bounty and sonic bombardment to allow you to retrieve force from putting the opponents characters in the dungeon.  Try to also lure them into the audience chamber so that you can use trap door and immediately force them into your rancor pit and allowing it to eat their characters making them lose force and allowing you to retrieve force. If they have no Tatooine locations you can also force them to battle you at places like Great Pit of Carkoon where Sarlaac can eat your opponents characters making him/her lose more force.
     My greatest piece of advice is trying to focus on retrieving force and making opponent lose force through your creatures instead of force draining.
