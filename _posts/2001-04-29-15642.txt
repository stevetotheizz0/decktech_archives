Strategy: '

Use Combat Readiness to take out Rendili and Kuat. Then Deploy one to two Victory-Classs Star Destroyers on each system. Place Executor and Death Star Assualt Squadron. Make sure to place Lord Vader on a Location if you want that Battle order to work. Deploy 2 to 3 TIE Fighters on each system for free if a Star Destroyer is there. Same goes for the TIE Interceptors. Place Pride of Empires on your TIE Fighters so then each trun during their move phase, they lose 8 Force And, of course, place admiral Piett on Executor and place the R1-G4s on any of your star destroyers. Make sure not to lose Lord Vader, otherwise, someone will have to go on the ground to make the battle order let you froce drain for free. Other than that, it should be a breeze taking out those rebels
