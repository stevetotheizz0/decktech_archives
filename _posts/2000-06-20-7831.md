Strategy: '

Well after my Dark Deal Deck failed miserably I decided to go back to Court)

 START
ACTIVATION FROM SITES
player4
opponent2
EFFECT
I start Scum and Villany b/c it gives me a means for early retrieval and faster deployment

OK LOOK.  I KNOW VADER CANCELS SCUM BUT HE IS GOOD FOR ONE BATTLE DEPLOY-SLASH-AND-DIE.  U SEE I USE HIM ONCE FOR "SURGICAL" STRIKES AND THEN FORFIET HIM.  OK?
TWO VEHICLES IS ENOUGH TRUST ME I*VE PLAYED THIS OBJECTIVE LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW.
IN CASE U DO NOT SEE IT BELOW JABBA IS THERE FOR ACTIVATION

I get a decent drain of twelve at my sites
Darth Vader is for suicide runs, he will not stay on the table for long)
Jabba helps with activation
Septoid Droids and Myo all have good forfiet
Several means of capturing
*All Wrapped Up
*Hidden Weapons
*Iggy with gun
Sarlacc is easier to feed to than rancor plus it gets a nice bonus with CC Fett
Zuckuss and Skiff can react
Feed either with vehicles or droid hunters
Vader*s cape helps with the somewhat low destiny in this deck, although it is not THAT bad (about 2.5)
Who says Sense and Alter are gone?

AGAINST MWYHL
stay on Tat and build up force OR go to Dagobah on a ship either way works
the obj makes them lose for not being on Tat
use Hidden Weapons to capture Luke
Secret plans makes them have to use what meager force they may have left when they flip or just not retrieve at all

AGAINST PROFIT
Put Mara and Kithaba at the AC, that should discourage early main beatdown)
Secret Plans makes retrieval harder
Capture and feed Han if he gets loose
Keep big force at AC

AGAINST THRONE ROOM
OK I always lose against this anyways but here goes)
slash with Mara
Bubo can take care of nudjis
4-LOM for EPPs
4 cards can add battle destinies use them wisely
I wanted to put in a ghhk but I do not have room

AGAINST ODDS
Resistance
Torture

AGAINST HIDDEN BASE
Use starships to control Tatooine and use Battle Order
Drain Fast
Try to probe *intelligently*
there is not much to say here but hidden base is not a big deal

I have not played the new 3rd anthalogy obj yet but I think I will soon
