 Reflection 

Strategy: 

Ok first this is an anti drain deck, the basic way to win is to stop the opponnent from making you lose force during your testing, then blow his mind with either your EPP force or surprises! ^.^

Explanations:
I do not use the way of things because I prefer playing surprise assaults which are KING right now... let’s say against a My kind of scrotum deck... gailid, jabba, boelo and chall beckan at the AC... drain and SURPRISE ASSAULT and kick their ass! I hope you haven’T finished test 5 and stacked a 7! ^.^

Wars doesn’t make one great + battle plan = cost 4 to drain! (again, another MKOS killer)

Stone pile: who would want to refuse removing 4 cards from the opponent hand, might be his scum, vader, palpy and such ^.^

Red leader/gold leader + landing claw: since you have a jedi test that let you get cards you can make these combos works and again stop these Omnious rumour decks.

Anger, Fear, Agression: can they come to dagobah? No, enought said.

Things I’d like to add:
On the edge
Lost in wilderness
Uncontrollable fury (again another winner!)

Matchups: I won’t make any because the deck is almost played the same against most kind. Honor is fun against HD, court and such unless he has no escape... Just fear... Search and destroy! Maybe put an alter to kill it even tho the +4
Please give me some constructive reviews. ^.^
