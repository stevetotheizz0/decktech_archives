Strategy

Use The podrace to draw out some defensive shields and then the tremor in the force to draw out another.  Now they will have two or three gone.  Send the first qui gon you get (it doesnâ€™t REALLY matter) to the generator core and then send obi wan to the generator.  If maul comes make sure you have two combat cards (or at least one) innitiate a duel.  Obi wan should win if he is armed with qui gons lightsaber.  Begin draining until another dark jedi comes.  By this time you should have at least one 7 destiny combat card on each jedi.  Beat him back until he leaves and then keep draining.  If another comes then beat him back and start draining again.  You will be getting a 6 force drain per turn.  THen have lsjk armed with lukes lightsaber and Leia rebel princess armed with anakins lightsaber beating and draining at Tatooine podracing arena.  If the enemy is playing a tie deck he wont stand a chance.  Just by controlling Core, Generator, and podrace arena with the characters i said you will be force draining 9 force a turn.  Even with anyone else there it will be 6 force a turn.  Use lando and chewie to fight on enemy locations (just because you need to give them something to do) and you should be all set '
