Strategy: 

I guess a DS tat maul could block my drains untill I drop down a main and then he has to deal with ALL of the characters already there.  Heh.  That just makes me all ticklish on the inside just thinking about it.


Lets think about something.  say I deploy 4 eloms and oh, say, leia w/ gun against igar and tempest 1.  So they trample an elom (assuming they have a somewhat respectable destiny in their deck).  I cancel a battle destiny with tanus spijek and the objective, they have power 9 plus destiny.  I have power 3+4+4+4, thats 15 and destiny.  Assuming I don’t have any other mains there.  With this decks average, I usually draw at least a 4.  Tempest 1 is ummune to LESS THAN 4??  wow.  That went in my favor Id say.  After that it’s only a matter of whittling down the forces.  And not many people play walkers in my area anyways.  Just me, another guy, and 1 other who I could beat with a precustomized premiere deck.


Pretty self explanitory. 
Get Tessek and his drains of death going, and b monk to pump up drains at other sites. 
Use the eloms to beat down on imps like vader, lots of dueling cards make hunt down less of a threat 

One of your bigger advantages is suprise.  Your opponent will probably look like he just swallowed UrroRRurrRs bantha when he sees you are actually playing AITC swarm.

There are enough mains in the deck to hold your own and make a couple beatdowns.

The destiny is high enough to make your opponent sweat a little in podracing:) (the average is around 3 almost exactly, which is actually higher than it sounds)

Jar jar has the suprise factor and can knock out those annoying cards like gailid, VISAGE, etc, and deploy anywhere he wants to. 

having obi wan bouncing around is pretty useful 
Luke can go in and bounce whoever 

I feel a combo coming... 

Losing Track + Jar-Jar = much pain and suffering on the dark sidelines hehe

underworld contacts is anti ISB and Ral Ops (like anyone plays ral ops anymore).  It is also useful to convert sites agianst court, MKOS, Maul Mains, etc...

Too close for comfort is really nice, a sort of projective telepathy for weapon targeting 

if things look like they could be bad, use bo shuda. it helps A LOT lol. 
Retreival comes from flipping obj and nar shadda, Aim High hurts their retrieval 

Tessek+arleil schous = deploy 1 eloms = funfunfun 
Tanus spijek is not essential to have out, as eloms get large power bonuses anyways. Save him for canceling an opponents b destiny. 

I activate forve 2/1 on average, w/ exeption of Cantina(2/2) 

Qui-Gon can keep hunt down flipped 

If you look at R3 and really THINK about it, there arent any new cards that really hurt this, as defensive sheilds are used for the opponents quote, nastier strategies, which for a while have not included this deck.  hehe.  

Well, now that Tessek has been resurrected and his power 5 elom minions are running around out of control, not many things can stand a big chance.  Also, R3 decks will be less non-reactive, which suits my style just as well.  Of course, it doesnt really matter if the ARE non reactive anyways...  Ill still drain them to death.

I guess walkers might be a problem, but you have enough mains to hold at least one site, or drop  jar jar/corran down to the 5th marker where they have their lone imperial walker...

Of course ties might cause a problem, just pray they have a bad hand and play/pray to an extent you have ever done before and you might win.
(Or of course you could always fake a heart attack)

(This deck will not win by huge differentials, but it will win fairly consistantly.  I even used to win with it without the objective back in the day.)

thx for your reviews
