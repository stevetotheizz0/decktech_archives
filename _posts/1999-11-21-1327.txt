Strategy: '

This is a big blue that has been modified to better be able to take on a fairly large amount of decks due to it's potentially game winning interrupts. Start D* and your choice of effect. Simply battle where possible and drain on the side.

vs Ops - Battle order start, and use Imp Decree to slow them down bigtime. Alter bargaining table/maneuvering flaps/yarna and beatup the ops. Monnok can hurt them as well.

Vs Hidden Base - Start Battle Order. Alter S-Foils/Yarna and monnok. Grapple Organised Attack/ICBW. Search and Destroy)

Vs MWYHL - start IAO and set up quickly. I have noticed that most MWYHL decks, whether they are test to 2 or to 5, won't strike until they have completed their tests. If they are testing to 5 get out S+D, CHYBC and Splans to get them to come to you. fortify your sites as they complete their tests.

Vs Revolver - start IAO. take your time deploying. Fortify one site with walkers, one system with destroyers and you should be right. CHYBC will help.

Vs Brentson Beats - pretty much same as revolver. Alter frozen assets.

That's pretty much it. It's fairly well balanced, but tell me if i'm wrong'
