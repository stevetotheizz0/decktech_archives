Strategy: '

Whoop I didn't say but I start IAO

This is a very solid and flexible deck. It can shut down opponents drains with Decree and fliped ISB. Enough space to go probing and solid on the ground.

The characters are mainly ISB's with piloting skills. Igar is good behind 3 of the walkers, Vader is strong and Arnet is the pilot of Tempest Scout 1 and is death to Arconas

The Ice Storms help clean out Hoth unless their playing with something like Speeder ops (trouble)

Strong against most ground decks, enough space to find the HB and easy to play. '
