This is a NON-REFLECTIONS III Deck.


For those wondering how I got the name, its from WWF {good quality stuff, though ECW was better.... but thats because their’ EXTREEEEEEEME}.


Anyway on the show, Stone Cold has a talking watch. Tazz said he did too, but his was Spanish. Stone Cold’s luckily is English, I don’t know what we would do if it weren’t English 

=^)



This deck is STRAIGHT CHEESE. Mainly, what it does is simple. You begin with the Race and the Council. This way, you have a great starting activtion of 5 force without your oponent’s help. This is a great advantage.


First of all, you win the podrace at all costs {like all LS decks}. The Step Backwards should defenitly help out with this one.


After you win the race, its time to insert. Use the inserts for damage. The Mess’s help get the Inserts to the top quicker.


Then, you set-up the Lar’s Moisture Farm with, of course, who else, the Lars. Here you force drain, and you retreive with the Harvests. 


And then of course, you always have I Did It, which is the greatest Epic Event ever.  '
