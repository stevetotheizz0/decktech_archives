Strategy: '

Ok first off, lets start with the Starting Cards


Mind What You Have Learned/Save You It Can

This card brings Dagabah out to start, and alows you to deploy Luke, Yoda, At Peace, and Yoda’s hope form reserve deck during deploy phase.

Once you have completed the first 5 tests, you flip, and get a number of things. First you retrieve 10 force, and place the destiny for test 5 on that test. You can then, at any point in the game, use 3 force to take luke into hand from a site you control (easy way to get him off of dagabah.) And, luke may now ignore all deployment restrictions.


Heading for the Med Frig.

This brings out Wise Advise, and The Way of Things


Wise Advise.

This adds one to each training destiny draw.


The Way of Things.

Ths card really has only one use, and it isnt much, but it’s still nice. This card allows you to complete jedi test 3. But it also gives luke landspeed of 2 while he is an apprentice on dagabah.


NOw on with the reto


Obviously one main goal should be to complete the first 5 jedi tests. So, using MWYHL/SYIC you deploy yoda, and luke, and yoda’s hope. Now you need to get the Jedi tests. Try to get the training area out so you can pull the tests easily. Once you have the test out, and you have targeted luke, and yoda, use MWYHL/SYIC to pull one of the At Peace’s to add another 3 to training destiny. NOw you have +1 from yoda, +1 from yoda’s Hope, +1 from Wise advise, +3 from At Peace, (thats +6 so far) Then you add the apprentice’s ability (6 for luke) Now you have 12 already, and drow your destiny (almost garenteed completion for most tests.


Some of you may be thinking why do i have the falcon and red 5 in there? Well, that is in case i need to deploy people to dagabah to protect luke while he is training i can still get them off. And so that if i dont want to use 3 force to take luke into my hand, i can have him fly off dagabah.


A jedi’s focus, patients, and resilience are in there because i have 4 people with sabers. Focus gets rid of aliens if opponent has any, patience adds 2 to power, and resilience keeps my jedi alive (as if i would ever lose them....) and if i never have to use them, fine, cause they is still good destinies. (4, 5, and 6)


Lightsaber proficiensy is there to add 3 to power of one of my jedi (not like they need it, but hey, who dont like more power?) it also allows for adding one to force drain, that way i can add one to force drain and still be able to use lukes, anakins (DOS), and Qui-gon’s lightsabers


Order to engage is fun cause if you can stay away from the opponent (on dagabah.....) then they lose force every turn, or, if you want, let them get to you (your jedi) and make them battle you with this, and woop them either way they lsoe force


Reflection really isnt needed, but it helps retrieve force, if you lose a good card, or needed card (like one of the jedi tests) So it is usefull


the rest of the charactors are ewoks, and epps (and jar jar). They are only there because 4 jedi just isnt enough to kill an entire deck (especially if it is a good deck) so they are there to help out


thats about it reallt, be sure to rate the deck for me, and make sure you put in comments, not just "nice deck" or "cool" tell me what you like, or dont like
