Strategy: 

Ok Start the starting stuff and on your first turn pull CC:DB,Rendili and Bespin, if you get Ren, then pull the Executor, you may need it. This gives you 2 of the 3 sites you need right away for DD. What you do after this varies a little. Try to set up Dark Deal as fast as you can. Don’t drop Bespin:CC till your ready to Drop Dark Deal. Once you have this going your troopers are fat on CC. Use the Assults and the power Bonus from DD to beat them up. You have great Drop and Battle potential with this deck. Something the last deck lacked. Don’t be afraid to go off of CC and battle you have tons to do it with, most of the troopers in this deck are ability 2 and forfeit for a ton with IAO. Lord Vader is a wrecking machine and your producing tons of force by turn 2, so there are no worries dropping him, the + to his saber swings make him my only Vader nowadays. People will say HB will give problems but it won’t you don’t have to get the occupation going to win, your deck comes out much faster than HB so you should drain them tons and maybe hit one of their systems. The only problem I can see is if someone comes down to CC real fast, in this case save up guys and beat them off with the Trooper assults, or if they are playing SAC then just sheer numbers should do the job. When Deploying sites, you really don’t need more than 3 down, this is tons of drains, you don’t want to give them a chance of flipping Dark Deal if you can help it. Well there you go, I hope you have fun. As a side note, for the moroons that review this, don’t bother to leave a comment with your crappy rating, I personally am not one to care what I get fromt he decks, I am just here to have a little fun and maybe help some folks out. Thanks Again, Jim
