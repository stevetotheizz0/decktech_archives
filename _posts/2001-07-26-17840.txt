Strategy: '

I wanted to post this deck now because when "Enter the Bureaucrat" comes out it will ruin this deck.

This deck has been good for me it lost one game at the comic con to a bring him before me deck, which is almost always an auto win. I fell for a trap I wasn’t ready for, he droped vader at my docking bay 2nd turn so I droped Jedi Luke at the cantina. Next turn he dumps Mara and stick, Iggi and 4-lom hits luke and adds a destiny with the Emperors power and draws a 7,6,2 I draw a 5 but lose like 16 force, and both of my Hans.  Which means after he gets luke my on the edges are done and I never recover he wins by 12. ROOKIE MISTAKE, Should have lost Grimtashed him first.

The strategy behind this deck is simple, set up at kessel and another location depending on what you are playing against flip and just drain them for what ever you can and control theirs.  

The key is to wait till the right time to drop to ground.  The only ship the dark side has that can compete with this in space is the executor, but you get to use the Power Pivot twice, and the destiny in the deck will take care of the rest.

Get to kessel and start draing ASAP you will wear them down, before they know it.

Anyways this deck did good for me , but after seeing all the new cards that are out " it’s as good as gone".
