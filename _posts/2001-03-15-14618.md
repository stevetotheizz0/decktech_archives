Strategy: '

To start pull your 3 effects. I usually pull Power of the Hutt, There is no try/opressive enforcement, and crush the rebellion. But you can start with different things depending on the area you are from. I pull audience chamber first turn along with ephant mon and park him at the securtity tower. That way I can make it so spies cant come down and get out Han. Second turn I pull Beolo and Jabba the Jutt and put them at the audience chamber. After that depending on who you are playing and what they are playing with the game is up to you. Try and get lando with some protection at the casino to play a little sabaac.

dont forget to retreive with your objective too.


Against certain decks


VS. EBO


Against this deck usually pull search and destroy asap and set up your casino to play some sabaac to retrieve and steal starfighters. Drain fast and dont be afraid to spread out.


VS. WYS


When you play this deck you have to set up and pick and choose your battles. get out secret plans and push there important cards.


VS. Hidden Base


Get down and probe asap. Once you have succeeded in doing this you can drain like a crazy man and play a little sabaac.


There really isnt too much more to tell you about matchups you just have to play to the best of your ability and shut your opponent down. '
