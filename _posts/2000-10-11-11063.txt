*******Response to reviews********

No s+d is not immune to alter.

Clash is huge in here and very much needed.  You never see it coming from ebo, Its good against decree and awesome with order to engage. Under the shiled its a monster.

Trust me brian this deck destroys ralltir, you would knoe that if you ever went to a tourney outside of a 5 mile radius, maybe something like worlds.

*************************************************

Heres the deck that whips its giant cox out over ralltir like a cloud and nuts on the planet. 

First turn get your war room and random hoth site, draw up. Only put the following cards at hoth sites to set up ebo and only the following- 
Ishi Tib 
Arcona 
Yoxgit 
Nothing else. If you dont have 3 of those or any combination of them thru your chimes then on second turn pull dagobah and yodas hut and more then likely draw up and get out your ebo. 

Arcon goes to the docking bay then moves to the 1st marker and its easier to prevent decree (which was up against me on two days for maybe at max 1 turn). If you have chimes get tibs over the arcona, tib is like latin for god over all or something i think. 

search and destroy is @#$%. if that hits the table drop obi or luke and alter it, if a sac war ensues win it but if you lose that then stick at the 4th marker. If you cancel the s+d move the main into the 1st marker, i dunno y but most players go after them then. 

Okay so by this point ebo is up and s+d is taken care of, the decks foundation. 

Start playing your game of keep away. put down projections and boushh and hunt for ships. dont go to space unless you have any of these 
barrier 
houjix 
hyper escape 
alter (and some sac to back it) 
hashn + ackbar 
wedge+ bonner biggs 

lateral damage fs you hard so f em back. hyper escape + ;order to engage = much anal insertion into dark side.  rebel barrier + order to engage is the same result. same with clash and order.

by hiding and draining for 5 at kiffex the win should be easy. 
some hints- 
80% of the time you want your obi and luke on hoth cause mains under the shiled wrecks. put boussh and prjoection out vs. opponent, not xpensive mains. 

home one is big, real big, and generally about 17 power. 

if they are whipping your @#$% in space drop boussh to home one war room for +3 power. 

clash is god card never lose it. YOull eventually play it and no one sees it coming. 

court is gay. you will lose if rancor eats a guy, drain race vs. court, dont go there and dont give em boush like a retarded quahog. 

dont forget power +3 from ebo. 

balnced attack is good.

if decree is a problem for you then your a turd.  between landing claw, arcona and big bad mains decree will never hurt. 

ISHI TIB is the mighty ruler of the world and a tracking machine.  with them you can track your sac, hyper escape, barrier, it could be worse, 5 destiny chimes or anything else every turn and draw it.  use tib mid game to track kiffex for retrival. 

thats all i have to say about that. 
I went 3-1 both days of worlds with it, only loses were to raphael day two cause i fucin waste all my alters in a sac war and he drops lateral damage and im holding senses and a control like a farkin idiot. 
my other loss was to jim lis court deck cause obi is a moron and likes to draw 1 destinies, twice. 

the deck is the king peeler and will win if you arent a waste sperm. 

post script: art rhodes went 2-0 with this in the team tourney two cause hes my nigga.
