I Did It


'

Strategy: '

I*ve got some new cards and decided to give RTP another chance, after it did so well the first time. It has improved in some areas and weekend in others. Tell me how you feel and how I can make this better. Thanks. 


I hate podracing But it seems to work pretty well with this deck, and it*s not so bad when you win. I retrieve a lot with this deck and racing just increases my retrival. I Did It is kinda hard to use sometimes since I only have 3 ships in my deck, but its a good defense against an Imperial Barrier or You Are Beaten, and it gives me 4 force from Boonta Eve Podrace being placed out of play.


This deck isn*t hard to play and is a lot of fun. It has beaten a solid MKOS and a great Rops. I have only done a little testing so I did the best I could building this deck and I am not sure of all of its weaknesses. 


Early Game

I pretty much just try to free Leia with 8D8/Echo Base Garrison tech. I usually wait till I get a Narrow Escape before I go out and get her to the War Room. I use some of my Jedi to kill any threats that might.... threaten me. If I am not racing against another podrace, I just wait until I need to retrieve until I win, otherwise I just retrieve whenever it is over. Death Star Plans may be played once I flip. 


Mid Game

I keep retrieving and recycling my power characters and just destroying my opponent. Padamé and City Outskirts are good to get some of the Jedi out. Bacta Tank and A Jedi*s Resilience are great to save my characters. If my opponent is dwindling down on characters, I set up some drains and finish the rest of them off. I only have little space incase Leia is captured some how and brought to space. Not very many people on my are play space so I am not worried about big space drains. More space could be added though, I am just not sure what to take out. 


Late Game

Still retrieving. The game should get down to a drain race, this is where I shine. We*re doomed cuts loses in half with Artoo. It*s nearly impossible to finish me off. Characters will do some significant damage to any forces my opponent has left on the table, like Orrimaarko, Luke/Han, Ben, Qui-Gon. If Prisoner 2187 is still on table, she is just awesome for draining. I will stick someone at the Detention Block Corridor for a drain of 2. I just keep on draining and retrieving until I win. Retrieving has allowed me to come from behind and beat one of the decks I played. 


The flipside of RTP is incredible and can be extremely powerful if played right. Track right and suicide Luke gets rid of Vader for the game. Suprise Assault is great when an opponent drains and then you hit them for some force, they never see it coming. I like Weapon Lev so my characters won*t get hit in battle. Hoping Mad? WTF is that? If I lose track of a We*re Doomed I just use this to go and get one, or if I need one and I won*t be albe to draw it in time,, it*s just a great card. 


Tell me what you think and how I can make this deck better. Thanks for reading.
