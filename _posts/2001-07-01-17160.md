Starting stuff

There Is Good In Him/I Can Save Him, Endor Chief Chirpa’s Hut, Luke Skywalker Jedi Knight, Luke’s Lightsaber, Endor Landing Platform, I Feel The Conflict, Heading For The Medical Frigate for Do, Or Do Not & Wise Advice, Scrambled Transmission, and either Battle Plan, Squadron Assignments, or Draw Their Fire


Object of deck 

This is a straight-on mains deck.  Draw Their Fire combined with either Beggar or Frozen Assets can lock a battle down, ensuring a victory.  The mains can be Nabrun-ed around (unless IAO is out), winning battles across the table, making your opponent stack on I Feel The Conflict.  This allows for two avenues for victory battle damage or You Can Save Him.

Get Threepio WHPS out first, then Mess for a hand containing what you’ll need.  Don’t move Luke out of the Hut.  Let your opponent make the first move.  Do not overcommit to battles, as DTF is your primary advantage, and the key to Dark battling is interrupt-driven.  Using Scrambled Transmission to pull Shocking Information & Grimtaash every time you can (check your deck to see what you’ve activated and survey your average destinies), and use it to control your opponent’s hand, lock down Merrejk, and/or for Threepio’s gametext at the end of your opponent’s turn.

Against most decks, you’ll want to start Battle Plan to slow their drains down.  If you anticipate early battling, and your opponent is giving you a lot of Force, start Draw Their Fire.

Against space decks, start Squadron Assignments, and wait until you have the elements of at least two ships before you go after your opponent’s ships.

Track your high destinies for use with On The Edge when need be.
