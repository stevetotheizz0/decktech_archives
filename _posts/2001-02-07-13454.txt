Strategy: '

The strategy is rather simple.  ASAP get a scrub to a docking bay, preferably with some backup.  Then deploy Sunsdown on your Opponent’s system.  If they don’t have a system out, then track it or use Commander Merrejk to get it from reserve deck.  Once you have Sunsdown out, which should be pretty easy since I have two Sunsdown and two Twi’lek Advisor, I just start taking over their sites with my many characters.  The "little dome droid" (2X-K7PR) really helps, making all my characters power + 2 and Sneak Attack helps get higher destiny, since I know there isn’t many high destinies in the deck.  '
