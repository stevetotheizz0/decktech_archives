Strategy: 

this is a old deck i dont think i will use it again

i have use this deck in day one 3 and 1
this is a deck you dont use twice in a tourney because
good player learn fast how to beat this deck
stategy, activate look if you need to draw(dagobah search for site)
draw then get all your double back in your force pile with yoda stew
do that until the big POW battle damge for sure, draw 10 to 20 battle destiny play the card that triple it
and leave the table after 5 minutes the winner
a guy attack my tantive load with epp with a executor vader in it with a lateral damage on my tantive and he have lost 40 card
so event if you dont like it this deck kick ass but play with it once and when nobody expect it
