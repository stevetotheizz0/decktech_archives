Strategy: '

The two Coruscant alters are there because if going up against a senator deck, they can place senators on their political effects and if you alter the effect, the senator is lost (just a good way to get rid of senators)
*****************************************
Jesus, like I said, you HAVE TO READ the cards to figure this out.  Christ, Senator decks don’t need 20 SENATORS in them to win, they just need to own the senate.  I have two that let me flip and for those who think I’ll never get them you obviously have never read Threepio’s gametxt.  And, you DON’T HAVE TO FLIP to win.  Jesus...the flip isn’t NECESSARY.  And for the IDIOT who said Plo doesn’t work, I mean it like this - If they only have one card in their reserve deck and they draw it for destiny, you can cancel it and cause a redraw (even if they don’t have one to redraw).  This DOES work.  But that only happens some of the time.  Make the deck and see just how abusive Plo is.  Just because you don’t get it doesn’t mean that it simply doesn’t work.  Plo is da man but you gotta see him in action to realize that.
******************************************



Okay, I can’t do much here cause really, you just have to READ each card.  If you don’t get how it works, READ each card.....


Starting
I start the podrace because it lets me activate 6 force for sure on my first turn, which is just enough to pull Yoda and Threepio and deploy them both.  I can sense/alter anything and cycle through my deck.  It’s great

Locations
There are only three locations because LOOK at the JEDI’s.  They all activate force for you.  You don’t NEED a lot of sites.  You’re draining in the senate and at the podrace when the race is over.

Palpatine helps me flip and so does the Leia-look-a-like.  Valorum is just a hoss cause he has politics.
READ PLO KOON.  He is a HOSS in this deck.  Once per turn, meaning YOURS and OPPONENTS he can cancel and make redraws.  Works great if they don’t have a second one to redraw.  Everytime I use him he works well.

The coruscant Alter is in there cause if they’re a good/annoying senator on one of their Political effects you can get rid of the senator at least.  If you don’t understand New LeaderShip Needed, read my DECKTECH’s WEBSITE SUCKS deck, it works just like the interrupt in there.  And yes, with Threepio and sense/alter three copies of A Step BackWard and two copies of Too Close For Comfort are PLENTY for winning a podrace.  

Effects
Chasm kills DS senator decks.

This deck was 10-0 before Friday, it lost to a senator deck because I hadn’t put in Chasm yet.  Have fun, this one wins like crazy.   '
