------------------------------------------------------------
The Main Strategy is simple:
Capture Luke, Circle Obi and beat the hell out of the rest.I don´t understand why Hidden Mains are so famous, when BHBM kicks its @#$% so hard.First of all here is a list of cards i want to add, it would be nice if you could give me some suggestions what cards I could take out:

Resistance - If EBO would be more popular in my area, this would be the first card to add.It is also good against inserts.

Projective Telepathy - against AFA, OTE and to keep control of the game.

Imperial Commands - rocks in space but I haven´t any room (suggestions please).
--------------------------------------------------
Now here are the reasons for the cards I use:

Crush - One of my favourites.Pulls Monnok, Evader, I Have You Now also stops Clash and multiple destinies at your sites.

Secret Plans + SSPFT - Shuts interrupt retrival down.Never put this out.Why should I use grabbers, if all cards to grab are such interrupts????

Circle - kills Obi and against WYS you can track it for something else.

Young Fool - Crap you think??? Well first turn Luke treis to kill Empy, so pull I have you know so Luke will die and this Young Fool won´t care you any longer.Also if he gets Rebel Luke with Vader to Empy sitting at Throne Room, then track a 6, Force Lightning, Young Fool.Very Simple (Tracking with Janus, Masta Move, Operational as Planned)

Other interrupts are mainly for battles.Also Lord vader won´t care about a Fallen Portal with Defense Value 8.
--------------------------------------------------
Matchups:

Profit- no problem.Get 2 guys, like Jabba and Xizor to Chamber and if they come beat the hell out of them.

WYS - Try to out battle them. SHould be rough but you can get it if you do it smart.

This is mainly a battle deck so just battle em all and you hopefully will win.This deck is a new one so I need some suggestions to improve it.
