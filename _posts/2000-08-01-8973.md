Strategy: '

there's no way that a light deck (namely TRM) will be taking advantage of your early locations.  they're not tempted to go to CCdocking bay or CCdrain -1 site.  they'll go to bespin system, and you'll bust out Fel in Saber1 and Bossk in bus with a lateral damage.

the idea here is to set up BIG damage for your opponent.  don't worry about spreading yourself thin, because IJASKAW and Barrier should save you.  Walkers are decent backup forfeit as well.	they'll only get 2 destiny at the most because of Crush.

basically, the deck sets up slowly, and then combats the TRM deck through occupation.  if they're running 2x each main, you can probably mess them up by capturing a few of their mains with 4-lom, zuckuss, and IG-88 (with all wrapped up).

against Jedi Testing, just go to dagobah while you set up occupation.  remember that you're immune to Projection.

your occupation works against Honor of the Jedi

they cannot turn vader (there is no vader/spoon)

you will smoke Jedi Luke with bounty hunters

super falcon CAN be a problem, but if you have enough patience, you should be able to Lat.Damag + beatdown w/3 destiny

always remember  it's all about "character removal" and "divide and conquer"

the more you screw them on THEIR turn, the more you can screw them even MORE on YOUR turn.
