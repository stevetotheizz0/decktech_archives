Strategy: 

early: get out sites. flip as soon as you can, since it cant flip back. establish a ground force and drain.

mid game: get out cc celebration and retrieve and drain. keep a hold on bespin and cc.

late game: use on the edge to replenish force. drain to win.

card choice:  
Awing cannon: green leader adds 3 to targeting, plus destiny 4

on the edge: you can use off the edge if you want, doesn’t matter.

2 chewies: i know there are 2, if you get both, just stop paying for one so you can play the other.

cloud city: casino: if you play the casino, people may think you are sabaccing.  they might waste a sheild. if not, its 2 force for you and 1 for them, and you can land ships here if nessecary.

match ups:

dark deal: stop the opponent from getting it out. if he plays occupation, control bespin and cancel it.

rall ops: ignore opponent, you’ll probably drain for more, and you’ll definetly retreive more.

carbon chanmber: chop the ugnaughts. get a ground force to stop the transport of the frozen guy. if they actualy freeze him, use it could be worse to block the damage.

any space deck: use dash/outrider to knock down executer, wedge and tycho or corran to block a destiny, and xwing lasers to waste bounty hunter ships, and use i’ll take the leader to mess up bounty hunter ships.

deck won 2 of 3 games it played at a local tournament, losing to a lightsaber combat objective by 2 force.
