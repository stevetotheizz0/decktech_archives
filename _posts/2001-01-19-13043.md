Strategy: '

well the deck is different really
get renili & chamber out 1st turnyou get 8 on second turn + what he gives you..not bad...then docking bays & activate at them......start with ig or 4 moving the prize on turn 1 if possible or turn 2 at least....they cant be battled & will flip the obj without having need of back up...then you have imps so no scum......BUT you are still imune to .<4 if in space with the ships or some such....the deck is strong..but i would recommend changing it for meta.....i personally am trying to fit in 3 grabbers for my reagion is very inturupt abusive
