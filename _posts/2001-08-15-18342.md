I owe props to Jason Waide for inspiring me to play this deck, its similiar to his, but i put in kessel run, hehe.


This deck is janky and in its first form. I basically just use leebo and a few manuevers to jump from coruscant to kessel and back and retrieve 12 from it (melas+leebo+Pulsar skate)


it needs some ground beef and i dont have palace raiders. tell me what you think and some good alternatives to ground peoples, thanks
