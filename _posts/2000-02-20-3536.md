Strategy: '

This deck is pretty good. With the awesome number of interrupts in here, you shouldn't have a problem freeing Han and keeping him alive. Sense anything that might hurt. Just keep Han alive and drain and occupy where needed and you should have a chance against any DS deck out there. This new LS OBJ is pretty sweet if played properly. LMK what you think. '
