Strategy: '

Well it’s not that complicated, but here goes


use strike planning to pull han and madine before you activate, before they do

anything on THEIR turn. as soon as you have 6 force(max 2 turns), deploy

geezum, madine, and shimi (via slave quarters). If you have enough force, you

can dump threepio at some other location to start tracking magic.

                 use geezum every turn until all locations are out, Insurrection pulls DB first turn.

                 plus, there is a pretty decent chance that you will get a site in your starting hand.



                 BATTLEBATTLEBATTLEdrainBATTLEBATTLEBATTLE (phew) until the opponent

                 has no, I repeat, NO characters anywhere within 376,492 parsecs of tatooine.


                 Han and Chewie are pretty much a given to have out, han pulled by Strike

                 Planning and chewie by madine by strike Planning. The camp protects against

                 mara (a little) and slows down things like ISB mobpoints,etc...

                 Sense and alter since I have so many high ability characters destiny is decently

                 high, but not so high that sense and alter will fail


                 barrier is useful, even in a beatdown deck


                 with a gift, artoo + threepio, and shimi, there is a possibility to subtract up to 4

                 from EACH of their battle destinies on tatooine, which is pretty much where they

                 stay anyways. Well, that certainly helps against the battle section of Ralops,

                 doesn’t it?

                 Speaking of ralops, (and ISB, all the like) Underworld contacts helps to preserve

                 my drains.

                 contacts also keeps my tat sites on top of theirs


                 Losing Track + jar Jar + BM munchen = much pain and suffering and laughter


                 the padawan man is always a nice card to bounce around


                 Inconsequential barriers is nice to cancel several annoying cards like NSP


                 there are many ways to mess with battle destinies

                 skywalkers

                 gift of the mentor

                 protector

                 smoke screen

                 chewie w/ balster

                 leia w/ blaster

                 gen han

                 shimi

                 artoo + threepio

                 A gift

                 changing the odds

                 losing track

                 lando w/ axe


                 wow that is almost 1/4 of my deck heh


                 anyways, You pretty mush wanna battle the heck out of the opponent and drain if

                 if comes down to that (heaven forbid)

                 but even draining isn’t that bad, esp with underworld contacts out


                 main weaknesses (so far as I can see) are

                 -somewhat slow start, depending on given avtivation)

                 -podracing

                 -heavy drain decks w/ beatdown protection (not a WHOLE lotta these, though...)



                 well I guess that’s all, this is the second deck like this I’ve made, first on

                 tatooine.


                 thx for your reviews
