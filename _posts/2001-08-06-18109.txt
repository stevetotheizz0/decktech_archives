Strategy: 

irvine and i put this one together to try and fend off WYS.  he beat one WYS at cont. championships, and i lost to one.  i don’t know if it’s all that great, but it does a # on RST podracing when Gamall/Guri/Jodo/4x ORS are sitting in the bunker, or when you SHOULD get all your ships against WYS you usually draw 3 destiny or more.  play agressively against WYS and they might not be able to stop you if you get a good enough draw.  on average, it might beat WYS about 4/9ths of the time, but who knows? maybe throw in an overload or something like that.
