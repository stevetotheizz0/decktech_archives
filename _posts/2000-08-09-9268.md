Strategy: '

Okay, if you know anything about ROPs, then you should have no trouble figuring this deck out. Most of the characters have ability of 2 and get a nice forfeit boost from IAO. They also get a nice power boost when I have an Imperial leader at the Prefect's Office. All of my starships have ability 2 or more, giving me plenty of easy battle destinies. And with ROPs in full effect, and all of my sites out, I'm adding 6 to my destinies. With the boost from the Prefect's Office, and my high destinies, holding Ralltiir shouldn't be difficult, even against Eloms, provided they don't show up in large numbers.'
