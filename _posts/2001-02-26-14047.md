as you can see, the destiny is good, so the tests are easy to do.


**** MOD take out the smoke screen and add another landing claw****


card choices

1. the three different lukes I use all different ones because they all have good abilities at dirrerent times.

2. gold leader in boat he draws a destiny and you can add a pilot if they cancel landing claw.


strat

basicly this is a deck that sits around untill it gets a good hand. you need to get a good hand first, then you should be able to end the game with a few battles.


matchups

vs ties this is the hardest matchup but you can still pull it off. you have to get out the claw early and latch on to a destoyer. get your sites out and drain away. they will only have a few drains with out the mods and your two projections. you should have them in the late game if you can get sites out. if they dont have weapons, load up the outrider and get it going.


vs court go to the chamber, use a lot of interrups and kill them early. easy as most ground decks are.


vs hunt down if you can get down a jedi early, dont cancel visage because it hurts him too, vader is your @#$% with the right hand, take him out and keep him gone, game over.


vs bring him before me ha, this is the most over-rated and played deck, give luke to vader, then give him the all-time beat down. repeat. this is not a hard game, your interrupts will come in handy.


vs isb wait for them to deploy and then take out their ground characters, again your interrupts come in handy, go to space with the landing claws. you should win this matchup.


again these are the ONLY decks that are begin played around here, when states comes around, ill mod then but right now I am playing to win here and  need a win this tournament or second to keep first in my area.

so please guys, make some helpful comments about this deck, tell me what to change and thanks again '
