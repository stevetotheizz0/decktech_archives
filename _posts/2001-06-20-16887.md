Strategy: '

Well the decklist is pretty self explanatory, but here goes my strategy.


Start

WYS

Tat

Cantina

Docking Bay

HFMF

Squadren Assignments

Don’t Do That Again

(Your choice, either Menace or Aim High)


Okie, pretty much grab two battlegrounds, flip retrieve and drain. 


Combos

Eventually You’ll Lose+Few Manuevers+Fallen Portal, Put the Few Manuevers back on your deck and FP about anyone you want.


Changing the Odds and OOC just get annoying

OON and Power Pivot help in battles and Hyper Escape can bail you out if needed.


Against,

Hunt Down Try to terminate Visage, Drop Luke in the cantina and do your best to avoid duels, and Kessel Run and drain like hell


BHBM Give them Luke, your destinies are high enough to win everytime, and either avoid battles or win them, again retrieve and drain


Ral Ops Projection and fly around and mock them retrieving and draining all the while 


Court/Scum Projection them and make them come to you, where you proceed to battle them into nothingness


TDIGWAT Menace Fades and take Cloud City ASAP


Thats about it let me know what you think


Ciao
