Strategy: '

General - This deck uses a lot of ability to withstand beatdowns and gets m@#$%ive activation to try to outdo the opponent’s deck. The Recyclers are huge in this deck because you can usually easily activate all the way to your stacked destiny and use it for whatever you
want. Standard procedure is to pull Dagobah
first turn , get Hut , Get Home One  DBay ,
and get Calrissian and Walex Blissex. This
deck is very tough because 99% of the time it will not get beat down ; whether it is TIEs , ROps , or Non-uniques. With the Bantha Droid
and Major Haash’n keeping Lateral Damage away there isn’t many decks that can hold their own
in space. On the Edge gives a fair amount of retrieval as does DTF.

Questionable Card Choices 
General Walex Blissex- Another General to search for , Deploys free to Home One Docking Bay so he is an free forfiet 5 moving to Ralltiir. Also
a pilot.

Darklighter Spin- This is kinda a fun card choice because nobody ever uses this card so I wanted too. With A Few Manuevers on the Falcon or Red 2
you just got an 8 destiny. Good if you see Vader and Tarkin in Space. This can probably be easily switched out for your local meta with Mr. Blissex.

It’s pretty simple but the ability to not get beatdown gives a lot of Dark Sides problems. If there is a LS card like the DS No Escape then
that card will immediately go in here to give it more power to pound on ROps. This deck looks kinda ’combo-lishous’ but since you activate so much and can use Tunnel Visions you’ll usually find your combos very quickly.Both the Liberty and KFC are really tough in this deck in today’s
environment and are key versus ROps.
