Strategy: '

before activating grab mob points with YCNHF if they did not start the mob killer. then acivate then look for something w/ death star in the title and also look to see if there is Wakeelmui if so pull it and if you have a Sienar fleet systems if so then drop a bomer then drop fleet systems. or if you have a twi’lek advisor use that to pull SFS then do the above. drop merrejk to the war room and grab kessel so your ties drploy -1. then drop any system you have. draw any thats left. second turn drop emperor if in your hand to him to the death star docking bay for some more activation if you have a reactor terminal out drop a bomer or 2 back and track them for your over load to kill some epp’s. or you can track a scimitar squadron and capture a qui-gon (i’ve done it before it was cool). don’t forget to retrive when you deploy your ties. when you need to play short range fighters to retrive up to 9 force in late game.
