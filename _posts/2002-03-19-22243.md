Strategy: '

Setup- draw either the executor or Rendili as your first action with priority on Rendili. Then use that MP combo to draw Perimeter Patrol. Then draw out the Back Door and you should have good first turn activation.(Except that your opponent does too.)

  The object is to get control of the planet sights first. This deck makes it easy because it limits the opponent in the following way

-they can not draw more than one battle destiny

-they can not block or modify your drains

-they will have a hard time deploying to attack

-they have to wait to attack giving you time to set up

Now these may seem like only slightly good bonuses, but they allow you to set up big drains that the opponent can do nothing about. You can wear them down with constant little attacks. Use the Monnoks to keep them on their toes when it comes to their hand. Use Imperial Barrier and IJASKAW to delay key characters and make the strategy wait a turn more. And use the characters in small surgical strikes, these are expendible characters. With the bonus you have on Endor the AT-STs (pull with AO)can hold the planet, they all react and PP is going to keep away surprises. Speaking of surprises watch out for Nubrein Lieds, that is why the IAO and Senses can be useful.

 The point of the deck is you need very few recources to set up your offensive damage strikes. And you can use whats left to try and keep the opponent away from those cards. 

  Space is pretty much secure. Limiting their destiny makes power the key to the systems and that is what you have.

  Please review my deck, include some comments, and I look forward to your insight. Thanks '
