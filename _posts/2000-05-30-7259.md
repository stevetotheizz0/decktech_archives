Strategy: '

Phat deck.

Start Insurrection, grab the DBs for a scomp link for HDWGITM?

1st off grabbers. what will they grab? harvest? HDWGITM? narrow escape? and thats IF they draw their grabber. im not worried about grabbers....

If your thinking this wont work b/c I might lose the essiantals (Beru, Owen ,Sandcrawler, etc.), Jur WRONG. I have 2 of them, and You should cycle through your whole deck and grab them before you lose them.	If you do happen to lose it from topdecking it, stick owen or beru in the achamber, play harvest to retrieve it, cycle through deck, take it into hand. OR just retrieve it in jur 10 force when you flip, then HDWGITM? it into your hand.

Against HD do tons of profit damage, drain, retrieve, etc. sooo e-z to win.

big blue- creams this. they battle ben revives, i retrieve, cycle through to get stuff working quickly, etc.

Against RallOps Stick the Spaceport DB on their planet after they have 3 out. have leia and her blaster take out AT-STs

sinear fleet- i set up so quickly w/ HDWGITM? and drain and do profit damage and retrieve, they lose. very ez
