Strategy: 

                 Greetings and welcome to another fun filled deck by the Garindan Collector. 

                 This deck was made in a jest at first to play against the upcoming QMC deck but it had some different cards in it, but I
                 wanted to actually make it a viable deck for now so I did and this is what I came up with. 

                 Its quite simple really you get your starting stuff out and then fish for Dark Deal first, then the Cloud City Occupation,
                 oh, and first turn fetch the Executor w/Mobilization Points so you dont have that ciruclating (before you activate). Once
                 you activate fetch the Death Star II: Docking Bay (if there) and drop a scrub, yes I know its not Cloud City, but thats a
                 +2 Force Activation momentarily, when you activate for your second turn, not barring sites you should have something
                 like 9 to 10 force not counting your opponent and you only give up 2 or 3 (on the first turn). After a few turns get that
                 scrub off the D*II DB cause hell get squished, of it you have the extra stuff after youve secured a decent set up with at
                 least ability of 4 (or more) then move someone there to back him up. 

                 The average drains in the this deck w/DD out, and no assistance from your opponent is 15 (thats the high) average
                 about 9. Most people will just tell me that, oh Jedi Testing will kill your force drain bonuses, yes, it will but not for long,
                 cause it will take them at least 7 turns to get it to go, and after the 3rd I am usually draining fro about 9. Also, Menace
                 Fades isnt that nasty against me cause they have to hold both a system and a battle ground, and well my space is
                 small, its powerful where I need it. And as for ground, well I have plenty of that as well. 

                 Against most every deck just set up as normal and force drain hard. Let them make the mistake of coming to you. Dont
                 deploy to Bespin or Bespin: Cloud City (vs: Hidden Base) till you have the ground secured. Then just drop, flip, and then
                 back up. Youll be safer that way. And remember, Talon Roll/Dark Manuever the OSs in the clouds where they become
                 HUGE!
