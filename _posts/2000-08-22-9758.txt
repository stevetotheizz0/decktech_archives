Strategy: '

This is a Profit that intends to get the quick flip.	I start with General Solo so secret plans does not hurt so much and if I team him up with chewie, beezer, or blount I can cancel destinies.  Talz is tech.  If a character is hit by a weapon, Talz restores the character to normal.  This helps protect Han.

Against

RalOps
Flip quick and do the damage.  Spaceport docking bay is used for getting on their planet.  Savrip will keep your characters alive and sense will kill their reacts.

Ties
Do major damage on the ground while deploying your small fleet to fight them.  Alter Lateral Damage and savirip the damage.  Your drains and Profit damage should give you the win.

BHBM
Flip with Ben controlling the chamber and get Honor out to lessen Your Destiny.  When vader is deployed, put luke away from him.  Your drains and damage should hurt them quite a bit.

Big Blue
Again, use your drains and profit damage to hurt them a lot.  Always keep han inside so he can't be trampled.	Savrip will help immensely.

Over all this is a very solid deck.  The SAC is great and will keep Savrip up and running.  Order to Engage and Savrip will win games for you.'
