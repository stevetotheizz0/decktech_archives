Strategy: '

Ok, well get Vader down as quickly as possible. Begin draining, and battling. Your high destinies should be able to overpower your opponent. I guess I'll go ahead and go into spec. on certain decks

Speeders
I'm using only interior sites, to protect myself. Be sure to drain in space.

Numbers
1 Torture, plus Resistance should be enough.

Profit
Start Mara Jade and Dr. E. Get Mara's saber down first turn, and you should be able to make them lose one of their characters immediately, (Dr. E operates). Just battle continually, and make sure you have the drain of 2 up in space at Kashyyyk. Destiny, will be the dirfference in a win, or loss.

Ops
Get ABCTTU out ASAP. Beat down, with your characters.

Revo
Well I've never seen a Revo deck, in my area, but just in case I've packed one Evader. That should be plenty, with Crush The Rebellion.

Rescue The Princess
Stop the droid with Restraining Bolt, cancel Cell 2187, with This Is Some Rescue You can also use This Is Some Rescue to cancel Im Here To Rescue You By then, you'll have the objective, flipped, and can move to the Death Star, to just protect the flip of RTP. If they do get it flipped, drain in space, and dont be afraid to battle. You can also use Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down to cancel their key game plan...retreiving with Death Star Plans.

Massassi Base Ops
Dont help them out, by deploying Death Star. Beat down (the +2 will not hurt too much).

Well, I guess that's it. Thanks for reading
