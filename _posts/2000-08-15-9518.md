Technique/Strategy
------------------
Against Bring Him Before Me or Hunt Down and Destroy The Jedi on Turn 1
send Yor Insight Serves you well to the lost pile to retrieve
Honor Of The Jedi


For Jedi Test #5 Try To Track a 7....Against BHBM your should try to track
R2 in Red 5 so that when You defeat Vader in a BHBM duel, Luke will not
cross to the DS.

At Peace is in here For Protection Against Broken Concentration.

Once The Training Grounds is out, Search for a Jedi Test During EVERY
TURN, This includes Your Opponents Kepp all Jedi tests in Hand
at All Times.

Intruder Missles arent just here for Destiny Tracking, They can deploy on
EVERY Starfighter in the deck except R2 in Red 5 and Red Squadron 1.
And the Quad laser cannon is For The Starfighters.

Super Falcon = 4 destinies
Han(P), Lando(P), Liea, Nien Nunb
Put leia as a Pilot With Lando If You Encounter ZIMH

Sense Alter Protection - I know it will be hard at first with the +4 and
the high Destiny Deck, But After you flip, which doesn't take long, You
should be able to keep your opponent from playing any devstating effects,
or intterupts. OFFENSE

Retrieval, against Something Special Planned for them, Being able to
retriev 18 cards should be good enough...Having that card placed out
of play shouldnt hurt you too bad.

ROCHE - Battground System where opponent can't force drain you.
	Also Used with S&KF



Wedge vs Red Squadron leader -- I use Wedge Instead he has better destiny,
and I dontplay with other Red/Rogue Squadron pilots except Luke.

Crackshot - This card just kicks butt in this deck because I hit so often.
