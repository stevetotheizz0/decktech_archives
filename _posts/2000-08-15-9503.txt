Strategy: 

What people dont get is that i DONT GIVE A FUCK about advise. i  just post
my deck to know whos stupid and whos not and when you say take this out
or put this in, most of the time i will think your a SCRUB because your advise
SUCK and if you play with it and you get rape dont blame me if you
 SUCK ASS you MOTHER FUCKING SCRUB

THIS DECK = SHIT I GOT A BETTER VERSION NOW BUT IT WILL BE KEEP SECRET
deploy papatine and get your activation w the db
deploy vader and your other bad dudes to inflict early damage when he deploy barrier and battle retrieve with first strike and use emperor power
grab sense and play alter
if you need more strategies to know how to play this deck...well dont play it, it is not for you
