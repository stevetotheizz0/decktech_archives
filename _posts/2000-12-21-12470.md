Strategy: '

Extremely card intensive, yes.  But if done right, it barely loses cards(able to stop 5 drains a turn at peak efficency).  Doesn’t rack up differential, but it is 4-0.  The only light deck besides MWYHL to win 4(mind 5-1 or something like that)


Started out as a fun deck, but it actually went undefeated in tournament play thus far.  A good way to learn tracking, especially in the early game while trying to satisfy HB.  Damn funny to see HB flip as EBO hits the table.  Works pretty well against MKOS with the POAS and a coulpe undercovers(drop TK-422 to Mara as she is probably the only imperial) but is a strugle against TDIGWATT early on, as the POAS can’t help you at all.

Start typical HB, I don’t really pull the systems in any particular order (but I try to get the Ralltiir system kinda early).  Watch for your Echo sites and 1st marker.	When you see the 1st marker is absent from reserve, draw up.  This usually happens within a couple turns.  The next time you see North Ridge, deploy Main Power Generators and North Ridge.  If you have them, deploy Garrison and ANSB, or the other sites and set up EBO.  Usually the time that you can set EBO is the same as the time you are ready to flip HB.  Deploy Incom and spread out for some huge drains while using the undercovers and HB text to kill of thier drains.  Don not forget the force choke on the back of HB.

This deck is posted primarily for my records...  I will be working on a new light deck for this weekend and on.  Would be a lot less restricted if I had a JKLS.  I despise the ”ultra rare” system.

Note, this is a fun deck mainly, but it is undefeated(4-0) in tournament play.	I just don’t like the low differential.


BY THE WAY...  if you want to see what I consider a good deck of mine, look at and/or review the deck on my page ”The gods of death...”  it is a very unique BHBM with an extensive strategy against many different decktypes.  '
