Strategy: '

Ok this is a straight forward Docking bay deck.

The docking bays that you might want early are

Home One docking bay

And

Echo Docking Bay


drop someone at the home one docking bay so they dont get aboard.

You will start building up your forces with stuff like the Dresselians and Endor scout troppers

Use take the initiative and Insertion Planning to make your destiny draws hurt where they count, the site.

Drop luke with the Jedi lightsaber and start your hack and slash battles slowly dropping those pesky troopers and aliens fast.


Changes that can be made

By all means replace Luke with Jedi Luke if you got them

The Jedi Light saber can be replaced with lukes

And the Endor scout troppers and dresselians can be replaced with better charachters like obi-wan and Mirax

This so far is my first trek into the Meta of both air and ground so tell me what you think with any Comments
