Thanks for the help.

This is your basic TIE interceptor deck with a few twists.  

Pull Wakeelmui before you activate with Mob. Points.  Every turn you can search your deck with the Obj. if you know how many twi leks, systems,  and other cards are in your deck you can know when to draw which is very nice.

All power and short-range fighters let you pull out TIEs.

TIE int. can be up to power 7, 10 with Fighter Cover and a laser cannon.  3 from TIE 1 from x-wing, 1 from dreadnaught, 2 from all power. 

Your retrieval with Sienar Fleet systems and Short range fighters is a big plus.  It can win you many games.

Gravity Shadow is pure tech.  Go read it if you dont know what it does.  Yes I know its from the jedi pack.  If you have a lot of TIEs at a system and they try to run Gravity Shadow and they are stuck for a big beatdown next turn.  Or you can track and use it to kill ships.
Simple but Deadly.

Constructive Reviews Appreciated.

Thanks for looking and make sure your deck can beat it.
