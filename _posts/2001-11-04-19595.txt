Strategy: 

Tactic:

I use the Podrace to retrive some Force and to play ’I did it!’
Then I play normal Hidden Base. I use the Mains like Luke, Leia,
Chwei and Obi to battle with the battle destiny adder Rug hug,...
This works very good. And I think that Hidden Base is one of the 
best Decks in Star Wars.
