Use Strike Planning to get Crix, and use Jedi Test 1 to deploy Crix, and use the objective to deploy Yoda. Use Dagobah to deploy Yoda’s Hut first, and use Insurrection to deploy Home One DB also. This will give you a good amount of activation for the next turn.

Jedi Test 1
Honor of a Jedi
Menace Fades
PoaS x2 {Projection of a Skywalker}
Battle Plan {shield} {increases the force needed to drain by 3}

Cards that help you get Threepio/Seeking an Audience out
Control / Tunnel Vision

Cards that help you stay afloat

Neck and Neck

Both of these cards, when we run low on force, help us jump right back up.

Here’s my 3rd version. I will try and post version 4.0 tommorrow, where it involves a QMC start instead of a Mind What You Have Learned start. If You have checked out all of my Droid decks so far, please tell me which one is the best, so I can use it for the tournament this Saturday. '
