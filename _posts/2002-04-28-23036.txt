Strategy: '

---play any defensive shields you want---

Well, this is pretty much "activate a lot, drain for a few, and direct damage" deck.  You pull out Crix, Chewie, and Wuta 1st turn and go from there.  Set up scouts everywhere and prepare to drain  I play a few cool cards in here for certain reasons

Under Attack - kills walkers, which kill scouts.
Capital Support - the general direct damage really starts to rack up.
Honor of the Jedi - no one expects this anymore for some reason.  Might as well stop damage.
Close Air Support - WICKED card.  Essentially says "add one battle and power destiny to a battle each turn on Endor."  Now THAT is wicked good.

You can fight off anyone, and drain constantly the entire game.  If they wanna come fight you, beat them down and cancel their destinies and such.  It recently won me 1st in a tourney. '
