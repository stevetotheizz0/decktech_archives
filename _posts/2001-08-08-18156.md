****UPDATE- I was unaware  of the seeeker errata beofre I posted this so I have taken them out for Obi-Wan and his Lightsaber and another Tibanna Gas Miner****


I don’t use Independant Operation as much as most people do but use the Miners to add to drains at Cloud Sectors and Luke’s saber to add at locations. 


A pretty much stratforward deck, you don’t have to be a genius to use it.   '
