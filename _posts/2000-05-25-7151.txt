Strategy: '

This deck's Strategy is simple, Get galid, mara, and presence of the force down and drain for a hole lot. You can beat down any thing that comes to tantooine very very very easily, You have 25 people. .  And with all the barriers you will never get beat down.

With Sniper, Dr.e , Disarmed, circle, and You are beaten, it is really easy to beat down any force that comes to tantooine.

Heavy SA Should not be a big Problem with 2 voyeur.

You can outdrainand out beat Throne Room.

Revo Does nothing Cuz you basically start with 7 non revoable force.

Hidden Base should not be a problem, the Early Drains should Hurt them Really bad, I havent seen hidden base around here for 3 months so i wouldnt really know.

Speeder Ops is almost gone.

Mind what you have learned will only nock your drain from 9 to 6. They will be almost dead before they can get to test 5.

Profit Has no chance.  When they free han with leia you beat them down with nerfherder. or you just sense SWLY.
They will NOT control the AC.  Lando, boush, chewie, and obi cant do any thing.  Because of Circle and Ephant mon.
Barrier will mess them up really bad when trying to free han.

Any comments?
