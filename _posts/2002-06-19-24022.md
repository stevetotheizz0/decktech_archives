Strategy: '

This deck can usually flip by the second or third turn because i usually get three or four characters in my starting hand and a path so i can drop them for the early flip i just draw to get a ship or two if i didn’t get one in the starting hand.  Once you get the flip the game gets easy, because each turn you get out the ships you need to hold bespin for menece fades and battle plan sheild.  With concentre fire and the guns on wedge and dash and something esle can put up a pretty good fight to hold bespin.  Drop whatever aliens you find or draw at your more important sites so they can’t modify them.  Then use signals to get celebration if you don’t already have it out and look for off the edge.  If they come to cloud city you must be controling north corridor so you can put they win this round on the site then cancel the drain.  Then drop on them for even more retrevial.


Matchups


HDJTJ- Just try to cancel visage and then go on the executor and drain because you can run around with path.


LCS- dunno never played against it


Court- drain and if they come to cloud city don’t deploy the DB so they can’t leave if they capture some of your people.


Senete- Menece fades kills this deck just concentrate on keeping it alive


Endor Ops- same thing as senete and try to control like one or two endor sites so he can’t even flip


ISB- just make sure you got menece fades running and keep aliens at you CC sites so he cant reduce your drains
