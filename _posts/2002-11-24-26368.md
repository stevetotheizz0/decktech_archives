Strategy: '

first of all please read the whole strategy before you’ll review this deck the "croatian deal" is more than easy to play

but some people (alex du sucker) aren’t able to recognize this start with fish as your 4th effect the other 3 effects are

basic, search with mob. points for the executor and than take the 2 interior battlegrounds into your hand. if opponent forgets

to cancel mob. points search for combat response and deploy it imperial command (Grand Admiral Thrawn against QMC) + They 

Must Never Again Leave This City will be enough to protect Bespin for some rounds. later on Guri & Xizor will help you, 

search again with 1x command for piett and take battle deployment into hand, search with the order for blizzard 4 and with

blizzard 4 for DLOTS, now you’ll got the downtown plaza occupied with DLOTS & Blizzard 4. try to play the deal only with

Obsidian 8 wait until you’ve got the ship in your hand. with the rest of the guys palpy,tarkin (v),fett & P-59 try to keep

some sites and give damage with the occupation maul and phantom menace will help you to clean up qui or kenobi so you see the

strategy is already over and i think everyone is able to play this deck (except alex)


Why Colo Claw Fish as your 4th starting effect??


- This card is more than tech, against LSC with starting the fish you wont get a chance to hit a jedi, so start with the fish

also in my area (escpecially in whole germany, the fish is always in the starting line) play Fish to crush the opponent (he must

overthink a new 3rd effect)


I think the rest seems to be clear, if not don’t b afraid to d-mail me thanks all for reading/rating and supporting my 

deck
