Strategy: '

I just thought I’d be a smartass and put this under expert. The basic idea is to flood Cloud City with a bunch of troopers so that the enemy can’t fight you and win. If you’re up against a big space deck, it’s possible that you won’t be able to keep Cloud City Ocupation on the table, but if you have Dark Deal out, you’ll be hitting them hard enough on the ground that they’ll just be delaying the inevitable. 


Some basic play strategies... Use I’m Sorry to get your two sites into hand before you activate on your first turn. You can deploy them right away or hang on to them until you have enough characters to put there. Use your text on the objective to get everything you need into hand, play Dark Deal and Cloud City Occupation as soon as you can. If possibble, play Expand The Empire on Port Town District, so I’ll have three sites where my aliens are deploy -1 & power +1, and my force drains are +1. Hopefully, the eneny will try to take me on once, so I can play Counter Surprise Assault to get most of my troopers on the table and retrieve about 10 with Abyssin Ornament (usually save that for late in the game, and remember troopers on Den Of Thieves count as being on the table). If they are dumb enough to fight me, Trooper Assault, Blast Points, and Blasted Droid are insurance that I can’t lose, along with my Dark Deal power bonus.   


Well, I think that’s about it. I’m planning on playing this one at FreedomCon. Thank you for you time.      '
