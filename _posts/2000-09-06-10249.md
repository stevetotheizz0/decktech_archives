		 I can use both without any bad consequences pretty easily, and if the opponent is using an admirals order that hurts me, I can get rid of their. Plus, they are destiny 6. The reason I chose 2 different ones is if that they are using the one that I chose, then I can still change it with a different one.

Ok,


First off, you get out your planet systems. Get some 2/0 sites on the table and get ready. ok, first, this deck DOES NOT TOTALLY rely on Our Most Desperate Hour. It isn't totally essential. Actually, I could take it out and still play and do well without it. So just play it like throne room mains and set up OMDH on the side. Get your ships on tatooine and alderaan and start using OMDH to retrieve once you have a lot of high ability characters out. That's about it.'
