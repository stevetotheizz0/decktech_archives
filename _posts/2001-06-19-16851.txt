Strategy: '

 
Ok so essentially what I’ve done is taken the Dark Surgeon as a template, and adapted it accordingly for the present enviroments.

The base template itself has been working great still after due to tatooine for me 6-0 in tournament play (sure it’s against Ontario players but 6-0 nonetheless) And after I saw the Ls lock that was played at Rampo, I felt it would fit well with dark side into this deck because you give up only 1 force to them from sites (3 if you have POTF deployed) so you’re halfway there.

Now you’ve noticed I’ve added 3 Twix sites in, I feel that using Uncertain like this deck does I’ll manage to pull them out. A natural addition is Disturbance in the force which stops their activation in it’s tracks, taking away any speed advantage they may have over you due to the Camp or Don’t do that again.

Essentially the base strategy is the same as it was for Dark Surgeon’s the changes I’ve made are just my ways for adapting for the current enviroment.
