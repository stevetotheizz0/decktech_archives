Strategy: 

The six Vader's should ensures a first/second turn
flip. Keep one dueling card for Obi and Luke plus
a focussed attack in hand to punish the light side(the
numerous high destiny's have kept me from losing any epic
duels).

The lack of sites is not a bad thing, usually
you can deploy to an opponet's site, but it is easy
to get one of the three in this deck.

Search the reserve deck every turn so that you can track the
destiny's numbers in the reserve. The only weakness
has been against Hidden Base objectives(have beaten
echo base ops without using space). Throw in bounty
hunters in ships if hidden base is a worry. Imperial
Propanda is intended for Kessel and Coruscant, but can
put it down on other locations if drained for three.

Please let me know what you think!

NOTE: If you have any ideas of what I could take out to put in, Zuckuss, Bossk, and Fett in their ships,
	   please let me know your ideas.
