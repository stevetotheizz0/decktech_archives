Strategy: '

In this deck i pull out all my starting stuff and the three immune to alter effects.	Playing i try to freeze my rebel by the third turn.  After i freeze i take a stop at the interrogation room for a bit and continue to tatooine.  If needed i will use tempest 1 and tempest scouts as escorts. I try to retrieve force when ever possible and in space i can put up a fight.  When I capture a character i head straight to freeze then retrieve and if i am playing a deck with high ability rembels Aiiii Aaa Agggggggggg is always fun.  Doesn’t happen much but its fun when someone tries to it could be worse my first carbon freezing then hit them with its worse for all that i can do. '
