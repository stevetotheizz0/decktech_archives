Strategy: '

Some quick notes on the changes from version one
Apparently you people didn't think I had enough characters, I took out some the the extra Aggg Aaa Agggggggg's to compensate for this as you thought that I had to many of them. I now start All Wrapped Up as I have many bounty hunters and I can easily capture characters and bring them to the Interrogation Room.

Now for the strategy
First off, start Twi'lek Advisor get All Wrapped Up. Next, hope your opponent gives you a Rebel, it will makes things a lot easier If they don't, remember you get to verify their deck, looking into their strategy. If you see a Rebel when verifying, remember that you can force them to give you one.

Now that the game is underway, you can start taking advantage of some the cards in here that make you go 'huh'?

E Chu Ta Use with 4-LOM to cancel 2 character's game texts. Especially handy against EPP's.

Aiii Aaa Agggggggg That Rebel that they gave you in the prison will really make this card do some damage, even if its for only 1 or 2 force, use it anyway, then play Sabacc and retrieve this via the Casino game text.

Also try to capture more people, then you can boost your drain at the interrogation room. If you don't have any Aggg Aaa Aggggggg's coming around, move the Security Tower captive over to the interrogation room to boost your drain.

Finally, set up Occupation to hurt the opponent even more. One final note, unless the have one weakling sitting somewhere, don't go to the opponent, make them come to you. And DON'T give the opponent any aliens if thy play the EJP objective.

Thanks for the critiquing and I'll listen and post a third version of this deck if need be.   '
