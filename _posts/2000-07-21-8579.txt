Strategy: 


I made a mistake and left out 2 cards they are Hoth docking Bay and Yavin docking Bay.

This is Pretty much just a normal Ralltiir deck.It has the same Strategy as My last deck.I don't no if it is a good idea to start out with battle Order cause it back fires on me alot. If I think that they are playing Never tell me the odds I will star out with You cannot Hide Forever.Please tell me if there are any other d*2 cards that I should include.
