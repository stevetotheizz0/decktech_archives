Strategy: '

Well this is a basic Profit deck with lots of characters, but I try not to use them to free Han.  I either try to free Han using Someone Who Loves You, or setting up the sharpshooter outside the Audience Chamber to pick off the aliens that get put there.  Incase you don’t see this let me show you how.

First Turn pull Crix and then Beezer (with Crix) and the portable scanner.  Then second turn pull one of the a20 rilfles (portable scanner) and then pull either Lt. Greeve or Corp. Janse (with Crix) and deploy both.  If you don’t have Sorry About the Mess in had then be looking for it every time you look in your Reserve deck.  Once it and at least one of your battle stoppers (Rebel Barrier, Fallen Portal, and It can wait) is in your hand then shoot.  Gather mains and either deploy them elsewhere or wait until you flip to deploy them so that Bad Feeling Have I can’t do its stuff.

Reasons for some cards

Insertion Planning - Destiny 6, used interupt, and I have alot of scouts in here.

It Can Wait  There is nothing like seting someone up for a serious beat down the next turn with this and possibly a Rebel Barrier.

I have played this deck in approximately 15 games and have won about half, so I am very open to suggestions but it has done well and when it does lose, it normally doesn’t lose by much.	I have played and won against Dark Deal, SYCFA, and a close BHBM deck (won by 5).  Lost barely to a TIE retrieval (before I added Aim High), and lost the only large margin game against Raltiir (31).	I have never played against a Hunt Down deck so any suggestions there would be helpful.

Please give some some suggestions on improving this deck or how it could work better.
