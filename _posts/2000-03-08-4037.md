Strategy: '

SORRY I HAVE MAKE AN ERROR ON THE DECK LIST CHANGE DROID SHUTDOWN( light side card )
FOR Shut Em Up or Shut Em Down

the main goal of this deck is to choke your opponent by activating more than him
after that flip with your 2 rebel base location and grab as fast as you can imperial decree
always start IAO, i know against first turn revo its a bit risky but with your large amount of location you can get decree fast and cancel those revo
-against oppget to the farm and put all you can get there after that he will drain for 0 and he will not be able to beatdown you
-against HB flip fast for early drain and wait until he flip
