Strategy: '

Just Cos it aint got its own meta post code dont discount this deck it is very viable and has served me well with victories over the top players in my local playing area they also are some of the top players in this counrty .



Okies well this is a easy deck to play starting stuff is Mobie point, Imppy Arrest order, and then either Battle plan or secret plans depending on the deck you face.



The basic idea is get the docking bays chuck Vader at endor and get em to come with either undercover spy or characters then slice and dice and walk away they soon realise it hurts to move from endor.


Use the Tempest Scout 1 & 2 to good use as they can react through docking bays to battles. Snoova is da @#$% along with 4lom and Igar with T1.


If you fear a big sky deck use dengar in P1 wisely and hurt em bad.


Dualing is a breeze with this deck i have not once lost a dual with this deck and tramples are fun on lil gumbies like blount chewie protector ect.....



Just be paitent and use sim aloo to your best advantage. Always thinking with your stomach is my personal favourite card the ls just hates there big bad boy with a stick missing from 1 silly card.


Ohh yeah and for those people with harvest problems like my area Sergeant Tarl is the @#$% destiny 3 and a stormtrooper to boot . SICK



This is a simple deck to use and it should work well in your area with a lil adjustment like  security precautions something special planed for them or a mandlorian armor for snoova just to give u 2 extra power.


OHHHHHH YEAH FOILS ARE A GREAT DISTRACTION FOR OPPONENT USE THEM TO YOUR ADVANTAGE 


Hope you enjoy the deck and dont cut it down cos i aint american or a top 100 player in the world it has held its own againeted the best in Australia.  '
