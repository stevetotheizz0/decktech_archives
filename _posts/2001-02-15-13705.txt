Strategy: '

Well you wanna startMWYHL and Dagobah Insurrection, staging areas, and Strike PLanning.First turn you activate 3+ whtever opponet gives you. Pull yodas hut Endor DB and throw down yoda to subtract from attrition, very cool. 2nd turn you activate 7 and then you pull another Homeone for activation of 8 Pull General Han and put him there for activation of 11 on turn 3, move him out l8r. From there on draw for Traffic Contro, dont worry about things being altered...it isnt happening with adding 4 to each destiny.Now from here out draw for you mains and Destiny adders..Skywalkers, I know ect,...Rebel Barrier/Order to engage is a cool combo. Drain and kill with fun sabers. All you sites are DBs so pick off some Characters Fallen Portals, there are PLENTY of high destinies for that.Taking there lightsabers with weapon lev is amazing, that can trash decks sometimes, lord vader is god with saber...so steal it that makes you are beaten not happen and those good cards. You will want to track destinies and play Destiny adders. PLay smart and youll win. '
