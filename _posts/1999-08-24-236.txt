Strategy: '

Start Obi-Wans Hut and Tosche Station with Careful Planning. Get a high powered character out there fast enabling you to start using your Tunnel Visions effectively. Beat down as necessary. If you go against space use your Tunnel Visions to pull put out Falcon and raise some hell. Start Revolving you own sites to increase your drains. Against pretty much anything else Relvolve their starting location to give you the force advantage. The big SAC pack keeps the opponent from playing damaging interupts.'
