4-0 at the regional beating both Michael Riboulet and Gary Carman.

Mains duel when you have tracked. protect visage with holonets. if they come out somewhere else ig88 can take out a few characters. mara and dr e can help too. the deck is self explanitory


Ops Start Battle Order. Get Vader out ASAP. Get the Holotable out for activation and a drain before they flip. Beat down on ships in the late game. Use other characters to fight and Vader to duel if you can.

HB get out Vader ASAP. Get Mara to the CC DB and get Search and Destroy goin.

Profit Just like Mains but start with Dr E and Mara.

That is how it works. Always start IAO, except against ops.

Michael Kessling
Naboo regional runner-up.

-----------------In response to reviews--------------------

- I do play Put all sections on alert

- I only own one DLOTS or I would run 2

- I think 3 ships is enough

- I dont own any more visages, and holonet has other uses too... '
