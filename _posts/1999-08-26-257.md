Strategy: '

This deck starts out with pulling Sleens out to
stop Opponent from deploying to Ralltiir before
you are ready. Once you think you have enough
power you can either kill the Sleens, use the
docking bays or use the starships to seek out your
opponent. All three starships were chosen for
their ability to transport vehicles and people
and land.

Against Hidden Base start Security Precautions and
either soak up drains with no damage or find the
base. Also kill the Sleens for force drains.

Against Training decks you can land and kill using
Hoth as a rest stop to get to Dagobah. Also defend
and drain at Ralltiir

Against Revolvers is a problem. You will activate
a minimum of 9 force with all locations out and
revolved. However you cannot let them revolve
Carida, so deploy that at the last possible moment.

Against Numbers Resistance and Search and Destroy
as well as ability ability ability should hold
them off.

One of the key combos in this deck is the
Sgt. Elsek / Carida combo to soak up massive
damage if a EPP 'Hit squad' decides to deploy.

I can't think of any other decks right now but
there should be counters to most everything.
