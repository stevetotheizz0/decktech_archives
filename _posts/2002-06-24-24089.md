Strategy: '

yeah, this is one weird deck, but hear me out, you might like it


This is combat, but its more designed to hurt the opponet through various strange and unorthodox strategies, all the while setting up huge drains on naboo via saber proficiency and lukes saber.


the deck can do many things, so just play as the situation dictates


Card choices

Han, chewie, and arto & threepio make up my own ”super falcon” which will draw 3 (chewie adds one when with 3PO)  battle destiny in of itself (5 with life debt) and stops the opponet from drawing any battle destiny (via the pullable artoo i have a bad feeling about this)


Dash works in as backup, or for a beatdown against one lone destroywer or tie.


Mirax allows recycling of artoo i have a bad feeling about this


Firgin d’an allows for retrevial, and to help stop destiny tracking (or at least make it a bit more difficult, since you dont actually have to use him every turn)


Artoo & Threepio make this deck work. Thank the maker lets you retrieve force repeatedly. They let you cancel battle destiny with  a card they actulaly pull, and they make were doomed work


chewie w/ blaster adds destiny when with 3PO


Were doomed is totally tech~ halves all retrevial (rownd down) which means you lose no force from drains of 1, 1 force from drains of 2, and 1 force from drains of 3. Played in a close game and you will almost always win


Padme - Pulls obi


Obi - isnt a jedi so he can initiate while objective is flipped. Works as a shock troop (especially when the opponet thinks hes safe since your jedi cant battle)


Joh Yowza - Makes the opponet nervous about drawing destiny. ”Jam” a vader or a maul and you cripple them (until he dies anyway)


Lightsabers - Add to drains (except qui gons, but hes your combatant anyway, so its ok)


Run luke, run - pile all your jedi at one naboo site, and all your other characters at the other. they attack the ”weaklings”, you pull luke over, cut someone in half, and smile like a bastard. Or you can just initiate if they deploy but dont battle (who knows why they wouldnt)


Artoo i have a bad feeling about this -

Makes the ”super falcon” really nasty


Life debt - makes ”super falcon” rule


Weapon levitation - gives obi a weapon (if being used as a shock troop) or just pulls your sabers


Blaster deflection - makes the opponet unable to chop your jedi in half


Eject, eject - kills executor. poor man’s lateral damage, lets you beat down executor


Saber profiencey - More drain-helping
