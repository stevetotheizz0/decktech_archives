Strategy: '

Well i just want to state off the bat that it is a simple mains beatdown with throne room start...but


Unique corvette instead of falcon is because they don't expect a "super tantive 4" and secondly it's ability to go where the falcon can't or deploy as a react where the falcon can't.  Plus i'm getting sick of the falcon crap

R2 and C-3P0 combo with Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.  Drop and battle.  DS has his power vs your power plus all your destiny.  This can sometimes end the game in one battle.

SA to take care of the usual alters mainly to drop Bad Feeling Have I so i can play AIHABFAT.

The deck does well and with the nabrun i can jump to where i want.

Worrt is in there cause in my area Ralops with sleen is very popular so he counters it.

The 2/2 sites are for draining and activation somewhat. It's not a force choke deck persay.  It's just a drain or choke if i have to.

Thanks for looking.
