Strategy: '

ok, before i start to tell you my style to play this deck, i want to say somethin&#8217;  

"THIS IS NOT A TEN NUMB SUPERSTAR DECK" 

i like the winkelhaus style but this is my own creation, of course their are some similar cards, but this 
is always the same in QMC decks. 


so, first i just play 2 locations to flip my objective after 2/3 turns cause then it rocks if you play to much 
locations or docking bays, you will lose cloud city sites and so you will lose da game Try tp pull out fast 
Han and Chewie with Falcon, i don&#8217;t paly Life Dept cause i play enough ships like the great "Redemption" if you pull 
out this ship with bacta tank you will never lose bespin system, but it took me always 5 or 6 turns tp pull out 
Bacta and Redemption. you can also keep bespin clean with Wedge, and his X-Wing Cannon, don&#8217;t deploy the cannon, 
just use Rapid Fire, and Zuckuss will be kicked from bespin. The most important fact is to keep the bespin system but with Power 
Pivot and some funny Interuder Missles & Ten Numb, you will also beat down a Exe. 

Try to deploy Leia and Pucumir to flip the objective, with Path ... you will keep them alive and Houjix will stop 
any f.ucking beat downs on cloud city, if you flip your objective play battle paln as the defensive shield, and try to deploy the 
Bespin Celebration 



My Style against Winkelhaus  


1. 

Most players, pull out "I&#8217;ll Take The Leader" ok thats fine, but" Concentarte All Fire" is just better 
1 example, all ya aliens are immune to atrrition <6, also each wepaon draw is +1, so with Colo Claw Fish you will always hit 
a Vader or Maul also With EPP Leia, so don&#8217;t play "I&#8217;ll Take The Leader" cause if you play this you also must play 1 db. 


2. 

The second think is Goo Nee Tay, if pull out this effect, opponent will never deploy more then 1/2 powerful mains to 
cloud city, example +2 with Goo Nee Tay and +1 for Bespin game text, so +3 for every dangerous character, damn. 


3. 

Play only 1 Off The Edge cause every good dark pllyer will kick your second Off The Edge, and so just play it at the end 
with A Few Maneuvers. 


So This was my QMC, Winkelhaus played this deck like nobody else, he just rock all da @sses with his QMC, and it&#8217;s 
amazing  But i think my way to play this deck is alo not to bad, or???????????? 

Thx to all who read/rated my QMC deck
