Strategy: '

The true stratagy is hope for the oppent to take custoty of Leia. Then with Strangle and Captive Pursuit release her. Once flipped battle, drain, and retrive with Death Star plans and Noble Sac (great with and of the abilty 2 guys and Insurection).

Other ways to free her is with any one of the leaders and cell 2187. All attempted Uttnni effects should be attempted in one turn with lift tubes and Rontos.

This was a really fun deck to play in tournemnets. People look at you funyy and say, I've beaten this deck. Grab leia 1st turn with IG-88, and just smile. Then when I strangle Ig they just cry. I beaten Scum decks, ISB, and Hunt down. The biggest problem is if Vader gets leia, Strangle is out of the question, but captive pursuit sometimes can free her. Games will be very close untill you can retrive with DSP.

This is not a great deck (Yet) but it was very good practice to learn something new.
