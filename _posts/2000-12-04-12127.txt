Strategy: '

Ok, before you Ass Fucks give me a 1/2 star for copying a deck, hear me out. I simply made the deck, and changed what I saw could be flaws and helped make the deck better. I got rid of the Executor DB for coruscant because if you have noone there, they can transit and cancel visage. I aslo added another Imp. Barrier, they can save your @@$.  I ditched an emporer, you dont need 3 with 2 holonets in there.
AS for the deck goes, it is a VERY powerfull deck.  '
