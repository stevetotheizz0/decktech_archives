'Locations(1)

Dantooine(Starting)


Starships(59)


Y-Wings x59 '

Strategy: '

This deck is so funny to fool people with , just Draw all your force for a few turns and once opponent deploys 1 starship to dantooine, Lay down all your y wings you have for free.  Just watch how much power you can have.  The look on their face is even more amazing. '
