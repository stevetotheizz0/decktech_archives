Strategy: '

first off, this may seem like a copy of Matt Lush's ROP Killa, but it isn't (not a blatant copy anyway)
this deck was first a Profit deck, I then added 10 Eloms, effects/interrupts/characters to support them, and had a 70 card deck, so I ditched profit all together

why did I choose Rendezvous Point? basically I wanted to throw off my opponents, if they see Redezvous Point, and you pull Home One Docking bay, they are going to get really confused, space or ground? beatdown or drain? this is one of the best parts of the deck, the surprise can really confuse and befuddle (I really love that word) scrub opponents

now that we're done with that, we can get on to strategy and card explanation

but first, responses to possible reviews
why not use Hidden Base or MWYHL? I don't like to use the objectives because it becomes more obvious as to what I'm doing, MWYHL hurts my SA and helps my opponents activation, and Hidden Base is just a few cards that I could do without, I have no need for other systems

why not use 3 Jedi Lukes? I don't own 3 Jedi Lukes, plain and simple, I'll try to switch a Masta Luke for EPP, when I get one, I may also try to get an EPP or premier Obi to help out

where's Orimaarko? again I don't own an Orimaarko, just my luck to pull an UR and not an Orimaarko, huh?

My (insert deck name here) deck could beat this. wow, I don't really care, if you want to help, you should tell me how and why a specific strategy would beat this deck

that's all for now (more rants may appear with the coming of reviews I don't care for)

The first turns
first turn pull a 1/0 docking bay, and drop an elom there
second turn, repeat and draw
third turn, pull Docking Bay 94 and drop any Obi or Luke personas (normally, but if you fear beat down, wait)
then the idea is to deploy characters to beat up your opponent and use docking bay transit to go say hi to them
it is very important to get your eloms out of the 1/0 docking bays by turn 4, thus avoiding the largest of beatdowns, barrier and fallen portal are in here to stop those early squishings of lone eloms

that's the basic idea, Battle and use Order to Engage to win

now for specific deck types
Court
this is what Mantellian Savrip is for, if they play All Wrapped Up, you can just Savrip your Eloms for attrition, just clean through their characters with ben and luke

Rops
a relatively simple game, stick to your game plan, as they should be occupied with trying to flip
if they're dumb enough to leave lone scrubs at 1/0 docking bays, Tunnel for Boushh and beat down with 3 or 4 eloms, that could be game there, however, the basic plan should be sufficient

ISB
this is pretty much dead, but still used in my area, so I am very cautious with my lone eloms, you may want to skip that all together, it may slow you down a turn or two, but its not worth a ten force beatdown
you should be able to battle them away from wherever they drain, Boushh is important here, because of her text while undercover, you'll be able to drain freely

BHBM
honestly, I haven't had the chance to play against one with this deck	yet, but it'll probably be one of the toughest matchups, if at all possible, kill the Emporer, most BHBM decks only use one Emporer, this could be a very close game, but should be very interactive and fun
remember, if you kill the Emporer, they can't duel Luke

Ties
this deck can handle ties pretty well, I hope she's all right will hurt them, and bargaining table slows their drains
although not likely, you can try to alter SFS as well
you can realisticaly drain for around 6 in this deck, but your heavy SA should help you (make sure to grab All Power To Weapons)

overall, I think this is a powerful deck, not too balanced because of the lack of space, but still tournament worthy and fun deck to play

all constructive cirticism is welcome	'
