Strategy: 

Start with Bad Feeling against any other deck than Hidden Base.  If they start HB, start SP.  The deck I play now is slightly modified from the one I play now.  In my deck I play now I play 1 evader (almost essential).	This deck WILL smash ANY Hidden Base deck with ease (assuming you play it right).  I cant really explain the strategy, because you have to be very skilled to play this deck.  Get Vader down ASAP and thats about all as to strategy.	This deck does well against revolvers because of the 14 locations.  This deck has many natural defenses against alot of decks without 'bullet cards.'  For instance against a revolver (even without an evader) you have alters for revos, they will have a hard time getting down mains with bad feeling have I and once they do come down you will be activating so much force and have so many characters you have what it takes to beat them down (this is just a scenario on what could happen, Im not saying it WILL beat any revolver)

Just remember -- this is a very good deck. But it will get SPANKED if you dont play it right. (This deck could be very hard to play for some people)
A deck is nothing without a good player.
But when in the right hands its deadly :)
