Strategy: 

Ok, You start RST, HFTMF, Strike Planning, Your
Insight Serves you well, and SqAss. First turn,
Pull Madine using SP, then, if you have the force,
 deploy CoK and Wuta from deck to landing site.
Next turn, Pull either Cracken or Blount with
Madine, pull Tala 1 or 2 with SqAss, and sacrifice Your Insight for
Close Air Support or Honor, depending on the deck
you are up against. Use Wuta to pull more sites,
and use endor commandos, GenCal in GS1, GS A-wings,
BS B-wings, leaders, etc to defend in space.
