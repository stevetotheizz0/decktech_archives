Strategy: 

For the few that read my other deck and gave me bad reviews because i made it funny this is for you because theirs no sexual comments or anything funny in this review, how bout getting a sense of humor, In fact thats an order an order from Jesus Christ.


Well in my opinion, BHBM can live through Tatooine, though it will be less power, One huge problem I found in this deck was Activation when the opponent plays "don’t do that again". Activation will be slow in the beginning, but you should be able to catch up.

This deck contains many powerful characters and bounty-hunters. You can easily get the cards needed to stack to win. Thats not really a problem. Most of the time I am able to cross Luke.

The space will probably not stand up to a space centered deck, but when their playing a ground or part ground part space deck you should be able to kill em off space.

The destiny in this deck is pretty good, most of the effects and interrupts have high destinies. Rebel Barriers are in the deck so that the opponent cant surprise you.

The rest is pretty self explanatory. Later to come will be strategies against other deck types, I havent played many different types.
