Strategy: '

How but How are you playtesting Ls cannot lose, but now yes now we have found the ultimate ds.

why no Sebulba What i  have forgot to put a Sebulba abd i start watto box well i did not forget Sebulba i have fired him, because he always lose the race(

why this? why that? BECAUSE iam not going to tell you every thing we discover in playtesting, while you sit on your a$$ and watch tv, no dude if you want strategy you will get up grab some deck, built more and more deck then playtest like you never playtest before, and if youre doing it good you will success and yuo will stop begging me for strategy.

but now with this deck ls have hard time winning
