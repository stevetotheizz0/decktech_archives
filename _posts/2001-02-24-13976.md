Strategy: '

***update 1***

First, at the moment in our region Hunt Down is not so often because WYS beats it all the time. The deck I created is the light side answer to all anti WYS-decks.

For all hunt down players add one or two TT. Where`s the problem. For the drains I have Boushh, Rebel Fleet and I can flip my objective. The Baragwin deals with Search and Destroy.


Second Yes, hutt influence is a good card, but I can still play Boushh, Retrieve with my Baragwin, Battle Plan and


       SURPRISE ASSAULT


And I can beat down his ships. Ok?


Third ISB is no problem. I cancel the ground drains, and what are you playing in space? Admirals? No problem, my destiny is 8, 12, 16...  TIES? With Cannons? Hyper escape, in my battles my x-wing Laser cannons go first. Bounty Hunter Ships? My 4 X-wings have total power of 24.


***end update***


Ok, the main idea is to blow up ships like Executor or Chimaera with ONE destiny.


Everybody plays Imperial Command and Guri against the multiple destinies of WYS and the Super Falcon. But i play a Smuggler ship with Vul Tazaene and Landing Claw and two ships at Kiffex. Then track your 4 with Mirax and use your game text of your doubled Vul Tazaene

(He has also ability of four and adds 4 to power)


So draw a destiny of four and use up to four times four force to add four to your destiny.


At the end of your game, you can flip your Objective, deploy all your characters, ships and weapons and retrieve Force for All wings and Figrin D`an and let your ships sink to use pile while the Spiral do the last drain at Kessel...

So if you win, win with 40+ cards.


But you have to play many fun games before playing a tournament. You have to be able to track your destinys. Mirax and the Baragwin might help you very well. Against alien decks, track and play Surprise assault and get them back with Tibrin. Let your X-wings go to Used Pile and catch them with Mirax or Organized Attack... So you have unlimited X-wings for your Rebel Fleet and you can beat down the dark fleet a second or third time...


With Order to Engage and Hyper escape or Keep your eyes open you can ”mirax” and block a drain and sometimes let your opponent losing force for the Order.


There is no special way to defeat the different kinds of decks, you have to play YOUR game.


And to all players who want to have a detailed strategy section, mail me and you can get one in German...

It is not so easy to describe the matchups in a foreign language.


Have fun, and sorry, Mr. P. Myers -)
