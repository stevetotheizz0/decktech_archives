Strategy: '

This is just a revamp to the RAOPs deck.  It went 3-0 at the Illinois State Championship with rather large victory margins.

A little strategy

Vs. Hidden Base

Start Security Precautions and go from there.  As soon as they flip start to probe, you have power in space with the four ships, dont be afraid to battle them.  One other note, even if they dont flip it is still good to start Security Precautions because of the extra force it gives you.  Just dont get @#$%y (sorry) in space.	As soon as you flip the objective find Search and Destroy and start to make them bleed.

Vs. Training

	Well, you dont have to worry about your force drain bonuses being canceled (except for the Saber and Kashyyyk, which you can live without.)  Start Come Here You Big Coward, shuts down everything they throw at you and the only way to counter it is go into space or come to Ralltiir, which are two safe options for you and not for your opponent.

Vs. Revo

	Its up to you whether to start Crush or Decree.  Whatever you do, it pretty much shuts down Revo since you will be getting a fixed amount a force each turn.  Plus there are 4 alters in the deck for effect extinction.  Go eat the revo deck

Vs. Operatives

	This could be a little dicey, I use Come Here You Big Coward to stop his bonuses and then I move in with the Wrath of God (after the objective is flipped) and battle his little guys.	Up to you.

Vs. Profit

	Start Come Here You Big Coward or Bad Feeling Have I, another decision for you to make.  Flipped Objective and Battle on Tatooine with the walkers.  Chewie is known for making a really cool sound when he gets trampled.

Vs. Anything Else

	You decision of what to start.	The back up effect that I always choose is Bad Feeling namely that it can slow down your opponent especially on ralltiir (Rebel Mains are deploy plus 4) Up to you

Happy Hunting
