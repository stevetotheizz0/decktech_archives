Strategy: 

Well, this is another I-need-acces deck. I made it for playtest purposes, and handles any kind of mains fine. Starting with crush the rebellion lets you search for i have you now. there are 4 in the deck, so dont save them. The Evaders makes it 7 Vaders in this deck. There is a ghhhk in, which can be very useful against hidden base or speeder beatdown or such. Search and destroy is against hidden base. Epic duel is for bluff purposes. The average destiny of this deck is quite high, so go for Ben with the saber if you have the chance to. The rest of the deck pretty much explains itself. This is a fun deck to play.

Sidenote: Add 2 Torture to make this tournament (?) worthy
