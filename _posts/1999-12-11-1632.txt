Strategy: 

	Start IAO against almost anything.  The ability to deploy a docking bay and a generic per turn is usually enough to flip on turn 2.

vs.Ops:With Ops already taking a blow from the release of ECC you shouldn't even see people playing them.  If you do though just shut them down w/Bright Center, Secret Plans etc.

vs.ECC Objective:Flip early and dominate on CC.
They usually can't keep the objective flipped long enough to do any damage.

vs.Hidden Base:Find security precautions and probe. The high battle destiny should do them in.
This deck has never lost to HB.

vs.Mains(Beatdown):Get Bad feeling out Quick.
The high deploy cost of those main characters should be too much.

Ralltiir Ops is a good 'suprise' deck to use and usually wins too.

Enjoy,
Walter
