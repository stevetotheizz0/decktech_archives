Strategy: '

	Start IAO against almost anything.  The ability to deploy a docking bay and a generic per turn is usually enough to flip on turn 2.

vs.OpsWith Ops already taking a blow from the release of ECC you shouldn't even see people playing them.  If you do though just shut them down w/Bright Center, Secret Plans etc.

vs.ECC ObjectiveFlip early and dominate on CC.
They usually can't keep the objective flipped long enough to do any damage.

vs.Hidden BaseFind security precautions and probe. The high battle destiny should do them in.
This deck has never lost to HB.

vs.Mains(Beatdown)Get Bad feeling out Quick.
The high deploy cost of those main characters should be too much.

Ralltiir Ops is a good 'suprise' deck to use and usually wins too.

Enjoy,
Walter '
