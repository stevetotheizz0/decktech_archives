Strategy: '

the strats for this are pretty general, not too many sections to it...) 


 AGAINST GROUND DECKS 

*pull madine and solo w/ strike planning, pull home 1 DB w/ insurrection, as well as deploying all other DBs. put someone at Home 1 DB for activation first turn. 

*drop madine and a scout to another DB, pump up that sites strength with a main or 2 and more scouts that madine can pull 

*drop solo to endor DB, get him a scout or two, chewie w/ caster would be nice 

*after this is set up, u are getting a good bit of activation, try to spread to more DBs asap, but do not get beat in battle. that is your oppenents job 

*scouts have nice forfeit with insurrection, kick out their uniques with oola. 


 AGAINST SPACE 

*this is obviously going to be hard against a good space deck. get the activation going as normal, drawing up as well to get a decent fleet. 

*stick your guys in a strategic point or two, try to beatdown on a loner at a system with tantive 4s ability to deploy w/out icons 

*put some guys on the starships to forfeit to keep your weapons of mass destruction alive 

*try to drain for at least 5 a turn on the ground, you cannot get much more than that anyways, unfortunately 




-delvar is good anti epp 

-kensaric is good for an early game scout pull, increases opponents deploy 

-ketwol is king of the docking bays 

-advantage is the legendary starfighter of the ground forces  

-I have a bad feeling about this is good - retargets interrupts and uttini effects away from mains 

-armed and dangerous pulls matching weapons 

-chewies caster is basically a wookie lightsaber (but it targets vehicles too)



        RESPONSES TO ORIGINAL DECK REVIEWS

-The scouts + madine are good for quick occupation of docking bays for more activation

-SOS may seem weird, but he can pull Anikans saber to help boost drains, and in this deck every bit counts  '
