Strategy: '

This is my first deck I built that is actually good. The strategy behind this deck is adaptability. Although the three effects I usally start with are there you can pick from TINT also. 
basicly I capture charecters and feed them to the rancor to put them out of play and make them lose force and me retrive force equal to forfeit. If by some reason I lose rancor I just send them to the dungeon with bounty. This deck has enough ships to be good in space and enough charecters to be good on ground. Please bear in mind that I joined the swccg about a week after reflections 2 came out. And please if you rant or like this deck please give me suggestions on how to improve it. Thank you. '
