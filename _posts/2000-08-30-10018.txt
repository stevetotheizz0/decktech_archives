Strategy: '

The main idea of this deck is to beat the crap out of your opponent in space and use the enhanced characters like Obi and Luke to control the ground with Zev and Rogue 2 to take care of walkers (if the opponent uses them). Ohter than that just force drain and battle when you have the advantage.  '
