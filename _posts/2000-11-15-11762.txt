Strategy: '

This deck although not an expert deck has won big upsets at local card nights and is fairly solid against imperial bodied decks.

Ralltiir Ops Decks
Pull Ounee Ta as one of the 3 starting effects as well as Ultimatum and Uh-Oh to get you a deploy of -3 to all raltiir locations. Wait until the opponent puts down an imperial at a raltiir location then for free stack up a load of eloms and beatdown on the imperial.

Tatooine Alien Decks
Use Do Or Do Not instead of Ounee Ta and try to pull Artoo and pull a gift from reserve deck. also be sure to put down Bo Shuda and then Order To Engage so the opponent must either leave the Audience Chamber unattended therefor cancelling scum and villany or lose 3 force.

Bring Him before Me Decks
Start off the same as against a Tatooine Alien Deck but then proceed with playing against the opponent as if their deck is raltiir ops, wait and beat down on the imperials
