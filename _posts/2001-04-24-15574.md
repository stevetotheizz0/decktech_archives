Strategy: '

Ok, here is how to play the deck

 You pull R2-3PO first turn, start HDWGITM? to pull twix sites for your activation.  Once you have everything you need you come down in one fail swoop.  Blaster pro/sorry Guri. Sense Imp commands. Stay away from ZIMH.  If you can pull it off, your going to draw 34 destiny, five weapons, power 28 for a deploy of 30.  I know it seems like a stupid thing to do.  But I just think the crazyness is to much to pass up. Also, don’t rate the deck by how well I can spell, the strat, or anything like that.  JUST THE DECK PLEASE Remember, llok at this deck with a sense of humor and also...IT’S ONLY A GAME
