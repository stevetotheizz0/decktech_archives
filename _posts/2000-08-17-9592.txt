Strategy: 

Replace Secret Plans with Imperial Decree, Devastator with the Chimaera, and one Twilek Advisor with a Force Lightning.

To begin, play Prepared Defenses to deploy Imperial Arrest Order, Crush The Rebellion, and Mobilization Points.  On your first turn, pull Carida and Emperor’s Power before you activate.	Deploy Carida and the Death Star II: Docking Bay with the Emperor there from your Reserve Deck during your first deploy phase.	Only pull I Have You Now with Crush The Rebellion if you are certain that they will be useful; otherwise, it’s best to keep the destiny 5’s in your Reserve Deck.  With the threat of I Have You Now and Force Lightning, the Emperor should be completely safe.  This first turn setup allows you to play Sense and Alter immediately and provides at least 9 Force activation on your second turn.	On your second turn, you can deploy a second docking bay (usually Cloud City, for its immunity to Projection Of A Skywalker and Lost In The Wilderness) with Vader there and then move the Emperor to the Throne Room to put the Emperor’s Power into effect.  With Carida (which becomes a nice drain of 2 with Chiraneau), Cloud City: East Platform, and the Endor: Landing Platform all being pulled from your deck, satisfying the conditions of Honor Of The Jedi is quite easy.  However, you should spread out to drain and cause direct damage only when the opponent does not leave themself vulnerable to attack.  We all know that Bring Him Before Me is much more effective when you initiate battles, draw tons of battle destinies, stack cards on Insignificant Rebellion, and drain away at the opponent’s locations.  The text of the flip side of the objective is merely a bonus, and most of your wins should be in the conventional fashion.
