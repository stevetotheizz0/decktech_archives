Strategy: '

UPDATE I made some changes to this deck ..thanks to the tips I got from you guys.This deck went undefeated at the Tulsa Ok Open.


Dont forget this is a customizable card game
you can change cards to fit your playing style.
I dont stack cards.I like to draw a 6 on luck.
The Han Solo way.

(Plan A)
Blow the bunker Force drain big.Dare them to come to you.

(Plan B)
Start  squad assignments and Insurrection with strike planning and go after them.



PLAN A
-the shield is down- will let you blow the bunker in no time.On your first turn pull the back door with this effect, then pull the bunker with your objective then on your next turn you generate 9 force on your 4 locations alone.
Pull your epic event and use throw me another charge to pull your explosive charges and in no time the shield blows.Keep your forces together untill you flip.they will try to stop you.
(Dont worry.I defeated an army of royal guards with my pity little band.)
I had more space in this deck but I never used the cards.SO I took them out and put in more mains.

-But if they play Rat opts-court-this deal is getting worse or Imp occp.You may want to go to PLAN B.
Pull your lando and your docking bays, build your force and go after them.you have the power.


THE CARDS
-crix madine; pulls scouts
-Lt page;rebel scouts deploy -1
-Lt midge; adds one to force drains on endor
-Sergeant junkin;+1 to blow bunker
-Qui-Gon Jinn; DUH
-Deneb Both ;force drain...lost force must come from FORCE PILE if possible.
- changing the odds-Destiney 5  used interrupt 
...verified opponets reserve deck? place one interrupt found there out of play.
-Out of commission-IN one game I placed out of play Emperor-marajade and Sim Aloo (SWEET)
-A jedi resilience;(destiny 6) CANCLE a duel you just lost
or just lost a character with saber?take that character into hand.
-Youll find im full of suprises;Destiny 6 Lightside duel
(AWSOME)
-Throw me another charge;destiny 6 used.
Pull explosives or shut down trooper decks
YOUR gonna see them on cloud city.I have forseen it.

I got my tatoonie cards a week ago(SQUAD MEMBER) and this deck is fast and fun to play.
