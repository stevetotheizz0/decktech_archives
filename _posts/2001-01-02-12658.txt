Strategy: 

The reasons why i use the following cards

Den of Thieves-Cancels a drain

URoRRuR&#8217;R&#8217;R x5-he is the rep use to cancel drain or destiny draw

Expand the empire- Put at Tusken Canyon and put Gaderffi Sticks there and at adjacent sites for a drain of 3

Bantha fodder- destiny 4 and lets me get out a taym, tusken raider, bantha, and my rep. recycles destiny

Opperational as planned-destiny 5 lets me activate one more force and recycles

Jabbas Twerps- Lets me retrieve up to 5 force for my leaders

Bantha Herd-lets me add one battle destiny with a tusken or bantha

Gaderffi stick- lets me get rid of epps weapons

Abyssin Ornament-Get out a tusken or retrieve force

On the first turn get jabba out of your deck with the audience chamber. use bantha fodder to get out taym, tuskens, and URoRRuR&#8217;R&#8217;R. Get out sandwhirls and bantha herds and put your tuskens at the sites (make sure you put the sandwhirl and bantha herd at different sites) for maximum protection.You should be able to get the objective flipped on the 3rd turn. then if they decide to battle you cancel their destiny. or if they decide to stay away from tatooine system you can cancel 2 of their drains per turn. retrieve force with jabbas twerps and with abyssin ornament. put expand the empire at the jundland wastes and put the gaderffi sticks at that site and the sites next to it. you should put it between jabbas palace and the desert heart because the other sites have a drain plus 1. if everything is done perfectly and all of the sites are out your drains will be 16 a turn. well if you try this deck i wish you good luck and you may ask me for advice anytime thanks again to all the people who helped me out.
