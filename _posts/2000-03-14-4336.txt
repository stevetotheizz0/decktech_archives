Strategy: 

You either Duel or battle any LS characters, and use Visage to kill off anything else - Visage is protected by two Holonet Transmissions and two masterful moves and a further 2 copies of it, so you don't need to worry about losing it in a hurry.

Vader and Mara can easily drain for an extra 1 or 2 per turn, and using First Strike and ABC will kill Operatives.
