Strategy: 

_________________Update__________________

Remove the Endor and Tatooine Docking bays and replace them with Cloud City and Death Star Docking bays (Anti-Projection of a Skywalker/Lost in the Freaking Wilderness tech)

Might be able to pull one Sense, as they become dead cards very quicky, and replace it with another Janus, or possibly some other anti-retrieval tech (Imbalance?).

Against Watch Your Step the deploying Emporer to a battleground DB turn one is a sound strategy IF you have people to back him up with (and if he doesn’t get lost in the freaking wilderness).

That’s it for now, again if you have any Constructive Critisisms, let me know.

_______________End Update________________

Please read the strategy before rating, and let me know if I missed anything major.

Alright, here goes my first attempt at BHBM.  First off I should explain some of the asterisks above.
* Currently Darth Vader, as I don’t have any Lord Vaders :-(
** Currently Running The Emperor, same as above
*** Currently this is IG-88 in IG-2000, same as other two reasons

So there is a list of my gross ineptitute at trading, now for some explanations:
Why Captain Sarkli?
Versitility, I felt the deck needed another spy in it, and with all his text he’s pretty good, if I do ever face Local Uprising, he’s there for that, he’s a pilot, and if I drop him on an opponent, clean out the opponent, and control the site (non-battleground) he shut’s down force production.
Why Commander Igar?
This guy can be quite the beast onboard an AT-AT, great for holding down a site.  However depending on the number of decks running the new Luke (Rebel Scout) I may have to drop the AT-AT idea and find more good characters.
Why Dr. E and Ponda?
Despite the relativly low number of ’hit’ weapons in this deck, I feel that having these two with either Vader or Mara is a pretty good way to win a battle (Watch out for Chewie, Protector and someone with a lightsaber though)
Why 2 Emperor’s?
This is mostly because of the new Watch Your Step objective, I’ll explain more in the deck by deck breakdown.
Why Thrawn?
He’s incredible in space, and he’s an ability 4 (Loved him in the books too).
Why Guri?
The prince is quite a force to reckon with, however he’s easy to shoot, fortunately Guri isn’t that easy (They also do a great job holding a site by themselves.
Why IG-88 and Snoova?
I have seen time and again, capturing key characters is the DS’s key to winning battles.
Why AT-AT’s?
In addition to capture, eliminating a key character before combat is a very good way to win a battle (thus Trample).  And tracking is quite simple with Force Lightning and Janus recirculating Cards.
Why so much SAC?
Despite the new Combo effects being really, really bad for SAC... There are times when you just MUST cancel a key interrupt/effect/react.
Why the Combo SAC cards?
Collateral Damage is fun when your opponent is thinking of dropping a bunch of EPP’s (Alright, lose Obi or Luke or Leia or Han...)
Uncertain Is The Future is a ”Wow, this hand is freaking horrible” kinda card, because we’ve all had draws that were pure red at one point or another.
WTF are you playing Ommni Box/It’s Worse for?
Easily recycled 5, can help with those pesky decks that like ’It could be worse’, and I LOOOOOVE making people shuffle when Jedi test 6 is about to be completed (Do this when they activate 1 force that turn).

Now, on to the Matchups:

TIGIH:
They’ll probably start the new Luke, so be very cautious with your AT-AT’s and be aware that Vader won’t be around for long if he captures him.	Be very careful with your battles, use the SAC and Barriers when they will have the best effect.  Capture key mains (or crush them) and win the battles.  Just remember to be cautious of a swarm, and also be warry of being lured into space against the swarm versions.  You will almost have to bring Vader out quickly though, as Luke will either drain you like nuts, or get himself captured.

Profit:
I hear rumors that starting Mara and Dr. E/PB at the Audience chamber is a good way to go, it’s a tough call though.  Lando w/ Axe and Master Luke wind up being a very bad thing.  If you decide to start those two at the audience chamber, might be a good idea to send the emperor there too.	If you’d rather just let them free Han that’s okay too, remember that most profit decks like to spread thin and draw you into traps and Portals and the such.  Probably a good idea to start Secret plans if you aren’t going to start Mara and Dr. E (I prefer to start them myself though, nothing like the Emperor on Jabba’s Throne)

Watch Your Step:
This is a very dangerous matchup, and the key reason for a second Emporer.  Watch your step will try to choke off your force production fast, so turn one it’s probably a good idea to pull the Endor docking bay and drop the Emperor there.  Your opponent will only activate 7 force turn 1, and that shouldn’t be enough to drop on old Palpy.  However having the emperor at Endor prevents you from being choked off by his objective if he flips early (turn 1 flip isn’t too hard).  After that be careful with your battling, play your game, wait for him to do something clumsy.  The extra destiny from the flipped objective is tough to deal with.

Hidden Base:
Bide your time with this one, if he comes to the ground, you should be able to run over him.  If he doesn’t, be cautious with your space battling, watch out for early lures... and don’t fall for them.  Once he flips, you can use hide forever to get Security Precautions, then toss either the executor or Chimaera, with Thrawn aboard up into space and start probing.  Don’t bring out Vader until you see Luke or are confident that he’s not playing him.

MWYHL:
This is another matchup that could be very tough.  Picking a fight is always risky with this deck, but you should be able to handle a few.  Lock down some Battleground sites early and drain away, don’t drop Vader too soon, unless you think you can win duels against Luke.  (don’t forget you lose force every turn to TYFP).  So be careful and make sure you can win your fights.  Keep tricks and if you think you see an opening, jump on it.

Agents:
Your best bet here is to outbattle him, he’ll probably be running Master Luke instead of any Luke you really need to fear, so go capture early if you’re sure of that.  Winning Duels with Vader is another good way to beat your opponent.  If your opponent is playing Eloms, fear the drops, keep your Barriers handy, and be frugal with your Imperials (keeping them in AT-AT’s is a good way to go... just leave the Aliens/Droids outside).

Remember a few key things, fight when it suits you.  Deploy smart.  And above all else, bring Luke to the darkside (coolest way to win ever).  Constructive Critisism is always appreciated.
