Strategy: '

Grab your generals and deploy your scouts, leave a lone scout as a decoy, and stack Luke, Chewie, Leia, Brooks Carlson, Etc. Then when they try to beatdown the lone character with Vader and Tarkin. Paly a dash and react all of your guys over for free and play a jedi presense. Play a fallen portal on tarkin and slice vader. and that’s about a force loss of 35 + just play out your profit, drain, battle, and retrieve. This combo is not needed to win, but it is serious tech.


This deck is brand-new to me so I would be thankful for any advice you can give me on it.
