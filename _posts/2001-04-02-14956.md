Strategy: '

Just Look...


Bring Him... They’re gonna win battles against three to five destinies at an average of 3 or more?


Hunt Down... Track the manuevers you will be fine... even if the screw over your stacked destinies you still have a descent chance at a good draw and jedi luke subtracts three from their total


Endor Ops... fly to endor... kill... retrieve


Ralltiir ops... RFC against a deck that starts Ralltiir... oh goodie for me


Scum... grrr... hard but do-able... Make them come to lukes site kill also get talon on the ground with chewie and han he gives them almost jedi-like defence values oh yeah and drain in space


Ties... Grrr... high manuever to dodge tie cannons... multiple destinies... and AO’s immunity adder... kill


Others... KIIILLL


Just have fun with it.


Note

Cor Eng Corp + <> DB = free freighters


Play old ben twice per turn with objective... this catches lots of people off guard


If guri isn’t present use your destiny adders on their beatdowns and if anyone is left use them again on your turn for your own beatdown 


Oops... Rebel Fleet actually is in my deck, subtract one raltiir freighter captain '
