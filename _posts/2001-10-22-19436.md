'

Strategy: '

The standard start is the Casino, with Any Methods Necessary to find

Fett in Slave 1, Fett w/ Rifle and the Security Tower. Deploy in force

to the Casino, find Lando with the Security Tower game text and play Sabacc.

Beyond this, respond to the opponent. If they shy away from coming to Cloud

City, get Dark Deal and CC Occupation going and make them pay. If they do

decide to battle, deploy the walkers, Trample, choke and hit their characters

and retrieve with Sabacc.

The Bounty hunter ships should be able to control Bespin CC until Dark Deal is

down, then move to Bespin to keep the objective flipped. Aqualish in walkers will help protect DD.

CC Downtown Plaza allows you to retrieve one CC location during your control phase.

Lando is important to the deck, so pay attention to his safety. Try and wait until

you are holding two CC Sabaccs until you deploy him so can guarantee playing during your

turn and theirs before he gets hit (against heavy SAC, get TINT or Oppressive Enforcement out

too).Also for a hit and run on Lando You overestimate their chances covers that.However,

the earlier he is deployed, the less the risk of Lando in Falcon

(which can be a major headache to get rid of). If Lando is replaces, use Vader w/ Saber,

Jade or Trample to kill him and then deploy him again (just don’t capture him by mistake). If the

worst comes to the worst, deploy him, play sabacc and then pop him on a walker during your

move phase (which he can pilot) and then bring him out when it’s safe.


The deck contains the usual counters - SecPrecs and the ships vs Hidden Base,

Crush the Rebellion and Evader vs Revolver, TINT and Oppressive Enforcement vs SAC. 

MWYHL shouldn’t be a problem - Trample deals with undercover spies, CC Occupation

causes force loss, Secret Plans makes retrieval difficult and Sabacc causes nightmares for

players trying to track those 7s for destiny. Just ignore Dark Deal and go with

Occupation/drain at the Downtown Plaza. Presence of the Force can help here too.


Major Problems For This Deck Includes


Aim High - nasty but the retrieval comes in small doses, so you can usually pay.

WYTTPOU - limits your sabacc plays, but you should still manage to retrieve at least 15.

LS Sabacc - battle for control of Lando Get Trampling and hide in walkers...

Lando in Millenium Falcon - Very annoying. Either pile ships on him or ignore

him completely and forget the Sabacc.


Above all, the key to the deck is flexibility - don’t be afraid to ignore Dark Deal or CC Occupation 

if battling and retrieving seems more likely. Likewise if the sabacc isn’t working

get some heavy drains in
