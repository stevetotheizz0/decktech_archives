Strategy: '

edit # 1


should be 2 i’ll take the leader on the deck list,and the shields should be any 10 you want,but get the grabber,battle plan,and dont do that again for sure


edit # 2


please read the strategy before reviewing.the new shield slows it very little,and it doesnt hurt much at all.enter the beurocrat on kessel will get controlled(canceled)and i will still drain for 3 there.i dont under estimate bhbm,but it is a deck i have never had problems with.as for the comment i will lose 2 all good players,,,that is a stupid comment.i have played many very good players with this deck and beat all of them but 2.it went 7-1 on the weekend at worlds,with wins agaisnt many top players.this is the most solid and versatile deck i have ever seen.dont make goofy comments until you play agaisnt a great player using this deck.then maybe you will understand


edit # 3


this deck has 18 cards different than jim li’s wys.i have been playing this deck so long,and have found these 2 be the msot effective cards.althoguh i think i am gona try and find room for a 2nd few manuever’s,and all wings/dark spin combo.just wanted to point out how much different it is than jim’s deck because people keep saying it is same old same old.



alright until recently this is the deck i had been playing since my states,and played it at worlds.it lost 1 game at continentals cause i didnt have the x wing gun in my deck and guri in stinger owned me.it lost at worlds 2 the hayes hunt down solid deck in the hands of brad reinhold.he got the most unbelievable draw ever i wana add.so its record is like 35-2 prolly,winning all my locals,and going 7-1 on the weekend at freedomcon


this deck is like many other wys,but i have alot of cards other peeps dont use.


yotts orenin deck ebcause i didnt wana play 2 ral capts cause there was a ton of watto decks at worlds and i didnt wana pay 5 for ral capts.plus he pulls free ride


free ride/endo celsoemtimes you just cant get the occupation canceled,this card works well for that and it is a 5 that can be pulled with yotts


artoo(broken little droid)what can i say,,,this dude is broken and makes the outrider drop the executer like a bad habbit.cancels lat damage,and then subtract 11 from their power and cancel their destiny.get back next turn with mirax-lol.so broken


its a hit/it could be worsethese 2 cards will save you so much force it isnt funny,and if your oppenent doesnt catch them you can start canceling 2 draisn of theirs everyturn by getting them back with mirax every turn


the camp combined with aim high these cards will give any mkos deck fits


2 ill take the leaderi use 2 instead of 1 cause i like 2 draw this card,plus it is a 6 so doesnt huty 2 put it back with mirax



ok now on 2 strategy.the defensive shield does very little 2 this deck.my favorite card 2 lose 1st is on the edge when i draw it,cause i know i have 5 force retrievel whenever i want.


know the cards in your deck/what your playing against.with this deck it is very easy to get the cards you need.


what i try and do early in game is get a 1st turn ship to the system if it is safe.then next turn i will try and get either luke,or phylo out with another ship to flip.then send the other ship to the system.make sure to pull kessel into your hand 1st or 2nd turn.


protect your people on the ground with dodge,and houjix.when you see the chance to deploy kessel get it out and start really hurting them.


the fact that they can only activate 1 at none battle grounds slows most oppenents alot.this is a deck you can’t play a few times and deside it sucks,,,play test it,and you will see it’s awesome power



now match ups


hunt downthey will probaly get a jump on you early.just play smart,and toss your lost interupts in lost pile for use later.there are 2 trans terminated 2 cancel visage.also if you get a ship to the system 1st turn you can start playing its a hit,control,and it could be worse 2 slow their drains.kessel will hirt hunt down bad,and always remember the starting interupt add’s 1 to destiny(this can be key alot) get a force going on the gorund,and spread out,make sure you have defense in your hands also.hunt down will spend most of the time chasing you around,and getting drained in space.not a very tuff match up


isb they will make it so you can drain for very little on ground.use your super outrider and smoke the executer with the broken droid.catch imperial command,and eventually they will start losing a ton in space.wys is very fast,,,isb will take awhile to develope.


lschopefully they will catch some random interupt so you can abuse your it could be worse.generally dont go 2 naboo unless you know you can accomplish something.get the admirel order out and spread on tatooine.watch out for a space attack.they will get 1 chance at a space battle,and then they will run from you in space all game.use dodge on the ground to keep people safe,because lsc generally has alot of good destiny,and few people to attack.


senatecertain versions of senate will do very good agaisnt this deck.if they are trying to do defensive fires,and limited resources on you they have no chance.jsut play it safe.ties can be a problem,and if alot of people in your area use ties,i recommend using another a few manuevers in the deck,and maybe an alternitives to fighting.try and keep ill take the leader on the table so they will have very low power.drain huge on the ground,and pic your battles in space.agaisnt a walker senate deck,just spread out with dodge.


tiesif ties are popualr in your area use the same strategy as you would agaisnt senate ties.ill take the leader owns,and pick your battles.track a few manuevers with mirax so your ships will be hard 2 hit.pick your fights


bhbmbring um is a monster on the ground,,,try and stay clear of maul.the drains at kessel will hurt them alot.give them luke right away,,,hopefully it will be jk luke.then use smugglers to pick your spots on the ground and battle.not a very touch match up in my oppinion


tdigwattmenace fades is your best friend.jsut keep it in effect,and cancel there occupation.do your think on tatooine with i’ll take the leader and dodge for defense.if the executer decides it wants to play,show them the power of the broken little droid.play smart and this is an easy match up.


ymsylthis deck will do alot of direct damage like hunt down.concentrate on tatooine,and spreading to drain.dodge will help alot.you have 2 controls 2 cancel ice storm,so if you have 2 send a party of smugglers to the defensive perimter and smoke them out for a nice drain of 2.always keep menace fades in effect so they can walker garrison.


mkos not an easy match up if they have those rebels wont escape us in there deck,but the camp and aim high do a very big number on this deck.if you can use your dodges effectively you will own this match up.x wing guns kill zuckus in space.spread on tatooine at db’s and keep dodge and houjix.good match up for wys.


please dont say anything about enter the beurocrat at kessel,,,control cancels that stuff.this deck if far from dead,if you play smart when you get your 3rd smuggler on the table you will be fine.once your 3rd smuggler comes out,start tossing lost interupts and playing them from the lost pile.this deck is the most versatile deck i have ever played,and can come back from anything


ty for reading this mess.sorry in advance for my grammer,and spelling.any question feel free to d mail me
