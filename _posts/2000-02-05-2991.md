Strategy: '

This is my version of the Profit-Odds deck that has been floating around for a little while.

Basically, you need to get Bo Shuda out ASAP to create a safe environment for your high destiny characters. Putting Worrt at the AC with OTE can
be just nasty. If they stay, they get hurt, if they leave, you retrieve.

vs. Ops  A Gift-ed Artoo puts some serious hurt on their drain potential while you hit the opponent for odds damage.

vs. Hunt Down This is a tough one to win against, but the odds should hit your opponent for some damage.  You must dominate and spread out in space for high drains.  TT for some visage protection, and dueling is a non-issue.

vs. DS Space All you need to do is win the space battles using the foils and Organized Attack.  Pop in Anger, Fear, Aggression to force them to come and fight. Chances are you can hit the opponent for at least as much damage in a battle as AFA would.

vs. DS odds Does anyone actually play that anymore?  Chances of that deck meeting this one have to be like 3720 to 1. (hehe)

vs. anything else Just follow the basic odds and Xwing swarm strategy. This deck should be able to defeat most decks it runs up against, especially if the opponent is not packing any numbers protection (which seems to be the rule these days in my area).

Thanks for reviewing, any suggestions would be helpful -- Brutus9
