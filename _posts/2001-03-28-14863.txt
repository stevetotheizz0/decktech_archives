***Response to Reviews***

everyone who mentioned anything about dueling - i really dont want to take the trouble to dedicate cards to something that wont help me every game, and can possibly lose me the game.  I thought about starting Epic Duel as a fake, but I hate wasting card slots.  More playtesting will determine if its needed or not. 

johnny chu - I mainly have the 2nd Emperor since hes 6 destiny and works so well with Mara, Janus, and Sim.  Sim is in here because there are 2 Emperors, and he can screw up tracking as well as adding destinies with the Emperor.  However, Ill take into consideration what you said about replacing them.  A 2nd Monnok was originally in here but got cut.  It may go back in, but the only swarm deck I see nowadays is X-Wing EBO which usually gets slaughtered by just one. 

Voice of Law - you are right about Something Special Planned for Them.  That card kills retreival and hurts X-Wing Swarm as well.  Ill have to find a card to take out, so any suggestions are welcome.

This is your typical Hunt Down deck, and while it isnt very original, it also doesnt duel like most of the Hunt Down decks Ive seen lately.  Dueling just isnt worth it nowadays with all the crap that can go wrong like glancing blow, courage, run luke run, the new bith shuffle combo card that messes up tracking, and WYS that doesnt use Obi.  So I made this deck that utlizes those extra card spots for better all-around cards that will help you versus any deck.

The strategy is simple.  Start IAO, MP, and either Crush, You Cannot Hide Forever, or Secret Plans depending on what you are facing.  Get out Rendili, your docking bays, and flip your objective.  Start tracking with the MM, OaP, Visage combo along with Janus.  Crush the Rebellion is a favorite of mine that limits destinies and can pull I Have You Now and the Evader/Monnok.  Battle Order and First Strike are 2 cards that I rarely see in Hunt Down which make the deck so much better.  Here are some card choices and why I use them:

Darth Vader - the original rocks with I Have You Now, and any time you draw multiple destinies, he is awesome.  I had an EPP Vader in here, but Im still debating which is better.  LMK you thoughts on the subject.

Dr. E and Ponda Baba - Theyre a beast, and I dont use Disarmed.  I might put in the original since he usually pilots, and the other one is cheaper.  LMK your thoughts on this decision as well.  

Captain Sarkli - hes a spy, messes up TiGiH on the 1st turn, works with IAO, can pilot anything, and can shut down twix locations.  Why not?

Cloud City: Down Town Plaza - it cant be pulled, but it is a solid location, and the extra draining can make all the difference in a tight game.  Menace Fades doesnt affect the drain here, and youre protected by Crush as well.  Perhaps the most important aspect of this site; no Fallen Portals!

I Have You Now - Crush pulls it, and drawing multiple destinies is always fun.

Anyway, here are the matchups:

WYS - This is the toughest match.  Start Secret Plans.  Flip early and try to put pressure on them.  Visage probably wont stick around too long, so battling them will be key.  There are 5 ships to hopefully take Tatooine along with Lateral Damage and Thrawn.  Take the Cantina, and avoid the Raiders when possible.  Guri is also very helpful here.

Mains (any kind) - Start either YCHF or Crush and battle them into oblivion with all your battling cards.  This is a Mains and Toys deck.  Play it as such.  Its that simple.  Beware portals, and let visage eat them  away until they deploy Obi and/or Luke and beat them down.

EBO - Start YCHF to pull Search and Destroy will do a lot of damage.  Battle Order will force them to come to the ground, where you can pound them.  Use your ships wisely, and invade Echo Base if you see the need.  Fetch another visage with MM when they cancel it the 1st time.  Monnok can really screw them over if they are playing X-Wings.

TiGiH - Start Crush.  Take Luke, and dont lose battles.  Keep the Visage damage going, and get your combos together to draw multiple destinies to inflict damage.  Mara and Sarkli can invade thier 1/0 Docking Bays and murder some scrubs.

Any other deck - Play your game.  This is a Hunt Down deck which can battle almost anything.  Keep Visage going and fight when the time is right.
