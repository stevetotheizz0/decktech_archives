THIS IS A TYPE II DECK, (Just in Case)


I just want to express my condolences to the players who will miss out on worlds this year.


Here is the deck that i have been using.


The strat is very simple, 

Get Maul to Landing Site, get senators to the senate and cancel drains. Using Maul and destoyer droids to drain and get battles, your senators are very high forfiet with begin landing your troops and cancelling opponents interrupts should be easy with the amount of SAC, if your opponent podraces, retrieve your 8 force back with Squabbling Delegates. Use Your 2 large ships if any space occurs.


Lightside Senate Use Civilty only Politics and the Point is Conceeded to stop the opponent.


THGG, Get Maul to Wattos Junkyard Quickly and other back up quickly.


Orn Free Ta can be used to stop drains if you have enough force and Yeb yeb and Gardula is a bomb  '
