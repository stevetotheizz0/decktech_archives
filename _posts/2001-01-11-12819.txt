Strategy:

****SAC can hurt this deck, if you expect anyone will be playing LS SAC put in TINT/OE and that should take care of it, but I would start with it if it was in there.  I havn&#8217;t seen a LS sense in months, and I don&#8217;t see it becoming bigger with the new combo cards.  At least in my area I don&#8217;t think SAC will be around at all.  This is a meta choice, and I would take out a weapon Lev for it.

This is a battle deck.	Go out and battle.  It is nearly an auto-win vs. mains because they don&#8217;t get Luke.  First turn pull a DB and Palpy, if they look like they fight on the ground, put him at the D*2 DB and wait for reinforcements.  If they are non-interactive go to CC DB first turn and drain.  Palpy can use force lightning to protect himself.  You will be generating a ton early, put some big guys down with palpy and they won&#8217;t be able to fight at that site.	Use the rest of your guys to fight em elsewhere, you should have enough.  Against space, you have a decent size armada and sac YISYW to get S&D or Security Precautions as needed.	S&D and some good ground drains will win it for you.  Use Janus and Palpy together.  Each turn search for force lightning and Janus it.  That way you don&#8217;t really lose a card from your hand to draw from reserve.  Janus will win you many games.

Card Choices:
Something Special Planned for them &#8211; The LS will be all about retrieval with the new R2 cards, this makes all their interrupts and KESSEL RUNS placed out of play when they are completed.  This with Secret Plans really hampers LS retrieval.

Id just as soon kiss a wookie &#8211; This card is great.  If they are going to come fight your guys, barrier the first guy they bring and IJASKAW the 2nd.   Then on your turn, beat the crap out of the barriered guy, and on their turn they MUST deploy the IJASKAW guy to that site.  If they don&#8217;t have any back up, they are in trouble.  Thanks to David Lankton for re-opening my eyes to this card.

Vibro-axe &#8211; Use with Snoova, capture Ben even when you he draws greater destiny than you, sick.  And he can search for it, and it deploys free, just plain nasty.

Weapon Lev &#8211; find that saber, or steal one from super luke or Ben.   Or just recycle a 4 at the worst.   Its not just for the LS anymore!
