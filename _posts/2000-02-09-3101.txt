Strategy: '

To begin this revision, I have looked at the reviews and made some changes. It was needed.

I have put in some more ships, not many but some. I also have made some changes to the interrupts and basically made it more lethal in dueling.

Hope you find it better.

I start with full use of the Objective.
And starting with Any methods necessary will get
you an early advantage. Pulling a site and hoping
to get more in your hand can make for large
activation. Object is to make your opponent come
to you. If Executor at Tatooine and you make him
loose to Tatooine Occupation you should be able
to pull that part off and maybe even hard drains
will do that. This is hard drain and power plus
that fun part of trying to get the dark lady to
bring Luke to your side.

I Played this deck against Hidden Base last tournament
and won barely. I had some luck. I also played a
mains and toys retreive sabbac deck. Won +32. Mara did
bring luke over to the dark side then. =) I lost to an
operative deck which I could not do much with a bad start.
I might have lost even with a good start but sort of
felt it was possible to win if I could come down hard early.

The deck is sort of versetile with many different
possbailites. Skip your own ground if you face a hard
draining operative deck and pound it. Also if you face
only space spread out to damage draining and fast occupation.
