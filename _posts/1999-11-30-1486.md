Strategy: '

I am trying to remember these cards off the top of my head, so if you think I forgot anything, drop me a message first. Start Hidden Base with no intention to flip. It will make your opponent change his starting effect (or interrupt) and also change his way of thinking. You have matching pilots in here for some small force drains in space. If someone tries to challenge you up there, recycle the A Few Manuvers, and load your ships with EPPs. The rest of the deck is focused on the ground. With destiny adders, EPPs, and the insane destinies in this deck, you can beatdown any opponent. For bonus points, face off against Vader and Tarkin with Han and Leia. Shoot Tarkin and ask if he would like to cancel. If he does, shoot Vader with that tracked AFM Trans Term and the Bothan are in there for Visage, and I don't have anything else to say. Enjoy'
