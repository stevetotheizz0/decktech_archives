********UPDATE**********

NO R3 in this deck.

*******END UPDATE*******


It s strategically a simple deck, but it does do well. You rely on hit and fade tactics to set up for a game ending battle.


Turn 1- Make sure you deploy a site from the deck to get all the zero draws out before you concentrate on setting up for the end game. Only deploy to Bespin if you have Red 7 or its pilot. Furthermore dont deploy here if theyre playing heavy space. Draw the remaining. 


Turn 2- More sites on table. You need activation. Start searching for your destiny adding interrupts. Hold your hand quietly, you dont want them preparing for your attack. Path away from any problems your not ready for.


Turn 3- You can pull off a defensive flip this turn, but only if ALL the sites are out of your deck. Deploy a ship and pilot to Bespin while you hold 2 sites then land at the docking bay or Downtown plaza.


Turn 4- Use Tunnel-effect to get set up to clean your opponents characters off the table. As you make progress to this end you can issue more and more drain damage. 


Battles with this deck are a little differrent. the more of your interrupts you have in your hand the less of a chance your opponent has. the power adders also help even the odds versus things like Maul and Vader. At most the deck can be set up to draw ten destiny in one battle.

This is acheived as follows

Han

Luke

Chewie

Obi-Wan

Threepio

Gift Of The Mentor

Life Debt

Dont Get @#$%y

Slight Weapons Malfunction


It reads like this, 1 for Han with Luke. 1 for Chewie with Threepio. Interrupt for 2 with Luke and Obi-Wan. 2 for Han with Luke. 2 for Han with Chewie. 1 for ability and 1 for firing with S.W.M. Yes, thats really 10 destinies. It works in space too when theyre all on the falcon. All but threepio that is, and use O.O.N. combo. That only gives you 9 draws though.


This deck is very enjoyable to play. I once had Luke and Han together against my opponents Darth Maul. I played S.W.M., Dont Get @#$%y, and Han added for Luke. Luke hit Maul forfeit zero and I drew 5,3,7,2,5. My opponent lost the game that turn. This deck performs well consistantly and has only one draw back, it caves to a SAC deck. You could take care of that though if SAC is played in your area, its just not played in mine.


Matchups


Ties- A hard game, but one you can win. You can beat them on the ground with authority and later take to space and kill a lone TIE with a whole lot of damage with the Falcon super combo finish. Itll be a hard game, but one well worth playing.


BHBM- Kill the Emperor. That simple. Corran to Throne Room with beat squad. Make them sorry for playing him. Also, take Vader out with S.A.T.M. combo. Space in this deck should be overcome well.


Hunt Down- Battle them to death at cloud city. Path away from their duels. They dont pack much space so drain there to your advantage. Again Corran to the Holotheater to cancel Visage and back up with a beat squad. Hold and drain. retrieve with Celebration. Dont worry about undercover spies, you have a lot of defense.


Black Sun- Path to advantage and finish Xizor with added destinies. Take a hit squad around and get rid of the Bounty Hunters before they can make a focused attempt at defeating you. One good battle is all it takes to kill this deck.


Senate- The senate dies to multiple destiny draws. Just stay there and kill them as they come to session.


Well thats all I can think of at the moment. So try it and tell me what you think folks.   '
