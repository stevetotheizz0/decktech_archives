Strategy: '

                  This is a simple Profit deck using scouts and a lot of retrieval. Here are
                  answers 
                  to a couple of questions about it 

                  Why no CAS with Talas - No room, or I would. 
                  Why no anti-numbers - There are no numbers decks in my area. 
                  Why Redemption - Redemption + Bacta Tank is a very abusive strategy.
                  Deploy the patient to Redemption cheeply, then shuttle him or her down to
                  Tatooine where needed. 

                  Countering other decks 
                  Hunt Down dueling - Keep Ben away from Vader, while letting Luke go at him. 
                  Since Luke subtracts 3 from attempts to cross him, your opponents destiny
                  will 
                  be hurt. 
                  Dark Side Tatooine-based decks - Hit them hard and as quickly as you can. If 
                  you win the first couple battles, they wont recover from it. 
                  SYCFA - Have your ships play tag with your opponents and hit them where 
                  they are weaker if you can. Try to keep Tatooine Celebration on the table if you

                  can, and if you cant, get it back as soon as possible. 
                  Anything Ops and TDIGWATT - Take the battle to your opponents planet 
                  after rescuing Han. Hit them as hard and fast as possible.  '
