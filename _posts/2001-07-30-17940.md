Strategy: '

The strategy to this isnt very complicated.  Theres 2 Landos so you can get him out quickly and put him at the Casino.  Then use sabacc as much as you can.


I use Captain Han instead of Han With Gun because he’s a lot better on the Falcon.


I use Hobbie and Red Squadron 4 and X-wing Laser Cannons to protect against bounty hunter ships.  The best way to defeat them is to hit them.  RS4 fires it cheap, and with the destiny of this deck, any BH ship should be hit and lost.


I use Lift Tubes, Lift Tube Escapes, and Path Of Least Resistance to avoid battle if I’m overwhelmed.  And if I dont need the Lift Tube, I can use Lift Tube Escape to put it back in my Used Pile, to get another destiny 6 circulating.


I need Do Or Do Not because my deck relies on interrupts.


The Bith Shuffle & Desperate Reach is to prevent tracking.  I use Sense & Recoil In Fear in case the dark side plays an interrupt I absolutely have to cancel.  Neck And Neck is for podracing.  Even though I’m not using Boonta Eve Podrace, lots of my opponents do, and this really helps.  One extra card slot isnt too much of a waste.  And the other part of it can come in handy sometimes, too.


When using Off The Edge, target Leia or Chewie if possible.  They are the least important of everyone that has a destiny of 1.


The reason I start with Your Insight instead of Squadron Assignments is in case they use a numbers deck.  If they dont, I can easily get SA with it.
