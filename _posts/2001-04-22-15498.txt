Strategy: 

First Drop your starting, so that you can start the crazy pullings!

Next you need to get the follow ing on a skiff or at the Audience chamber:
Mighty Jabba
Bib Fortuna
Boelo

Witten has to go to the chamber or the deck wont work!
Nebit goes with you jawas to stop them from bickering and Use mercenary pilot to run jabas entorage around for three Battle destiny and cancel one destiny!

Battle anyone and protect your jawas hopefully you got the jawa camp and can start marching your jawas staight into luke! If yu got the skiff with the entourage use it to badly damage your opponent. the only problem is the deck has no space so you have to make them come down to you.
This deck does poorly against ebo (shudder) so i suggest you try your hardest to force drain them to death with mosep and you jawas.

After a few games you’ll see JAWAS RULE!

To this day my friends shudder at the thought of haveing thier good charachters beat down by jawas!

GL and may the Jawas be with you!
