Strategy: '

The Basics (Hehe)

Basically this is designed for serious direct damage. 
1. Objective
2. First Strike
3. Search and Destroy
4. Insignifigant Rebellion
5. Abyss if they play doulbles and race destinies raise the odds of this working and their race destiny is zero...sweet
6. Ability, Ability, Ability... deploy or die, deploy and die, it is a free galaxy after all
7. Podracing Victory

Basically you retrieve force.

1. First Strike
2. Scum and Villiany
3. No Escape
4. Podracing Victory

Basically you deploy cheap even with The Camp.
Basically your drains can’t be stopped with Hutt Influence.
Basically you give up only 4 force... less if you decide to trade out the DBs for something else.
Basically you set up fast... more so against Profit.
Basically Qui-Gon and A Jedi’s Focus can really suck for you... but nothing is flawless, at least not forever.
Basically Bounty Hunters can kick, definitely if they are armed. 
Basically if you keep them off Tatooine your gold.
Basically I am tired of typing.
