Strategy: '

Note this deck is only in the air, but it does really great no matter what.

The Deck

 This deck is centered in space. It uses Squadron Assignments for powerful matching ship/pilots, B-wings with Intruder missiles to shoot almost anything down, and Kessel Runs with smugglers to retrieve, and Baragwins to retrieve.

Why I Put Cards In

 Insurrection-In there pretty much just to pull the Home One Dock. Bay for the Baragwins and Corporal Marmor to start retrieving.
 HB Alderaan-I like Alderaan as my Hidden Base because its not a battle ground, so the dark side cant deploy there. Makes putting the objectiveout of play harder.
 The Unique Fighters and Pilots-The unique fighters and pilots are great. They are all really powerful and have immunity of at least 4.
 All Of The B-wings- Blue Squad. B-wings with Inturder Missiles on them can shoot almost anything down. Stick 2 or more missles on them and track the right destiny and they can shoot down even the Executor.

First Turn

Deploy any system you want and pull the Home One Docking Bay. Deploy any starships to Rendezvous Point. Keep Drawing till you get Traffic Cotrol then jsut keep putting what you don’t want back in.

The rest of the game

Get allt he systems out and build a fleet at the Rendezvous point and load everybody in Home One and go to Kessel. Let everybody out and go spread out accross the systems.

Let Mirax, Han, and the Ralltiir Freighter Cpatains do Kessel Runs and get Marmor and a Baragwin to the Home One Docking Bay and start retrieving.
