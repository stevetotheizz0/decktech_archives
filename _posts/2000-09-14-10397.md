Anyone else want some steak?

In case you don’t know what the Battle of Endor format is, it’s a constructed format with only cards from Endor, Death Star 2, and Death Star 2 Starter decks. Check Decipher’s site if you don’t believe me or something.

Well, there it is. Hell, I’m not even totally sure how to play the mother. Of course grab Madine first thing, then activate and stick him to the Home One D Bay which you pulled on your deploy phase, right? You’ll have to take the chance of leaving him there alone for one turn, so pray to whatever that your nemesis doesn’t have Merrejk or Sarkli, and then next turn grab a suitable scout to sit with him. Send Kensaric with a pal ASAP to the IN-DOH D Bay, and start building up there... if no competition comes to hinder you (yeah right) then you’ll be getting at least 9 per turn activate. Should be swell to get set-up... don’t draw anymore when you’re down to 20 Life Force, unless absolutely necessary... these will almost always be close games. Now specific card choices
A280 Rifle So its a crappy weapon, you think? Well, it does shoot for free and Janse, Greeve and Midge each add +1 when they shoot it (Midge +2 if he’s with only scouts). It can get vehicles, and adjacent sites, too.
Enhanced Proton Torpedoes In case some nut tries to build a Death Star, or Ten Numb can blow stuff up.
Rebel Leadership Not nearly as good as its counterpart, Imperial Command, but still decent w/3 Generals and one Admiral.
Our Only Hope Get card(s) back from BHBM is good.
Back Door Your hopeful drain site, plus you might have to run in the Bunker. Are you a back door girl?
Rebel Landing Site The only safe place from Perimeter Patrol.
Hidden Forest Trail Activation, and move anywhere on IN-DOH
Aquaris Activation, plus make their Dreadnaughts- umm, nevermind.

There ya have it. ALL suggestions are welcome. Oh, I didn’t use Rebel Strike Team cuz I don’t think it will ever flip. But I could be wrong...    '
