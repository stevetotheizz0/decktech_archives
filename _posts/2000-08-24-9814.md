Strategy: '

This is a tie deck.  yeehaw.

Start the Set your course stuff, and pull wakeelmui first turn if it's not in your opening hand.
Twi'lek or deploy Sienar Fleet Systems (almost always within the first two turns)
and drop a tie to wakeelmui.  Next, I drop one to the docking bay to
satisfy Battle Order.

If they come to beat up my tie at the docking bay, so what.
deploy one there every turn, sac it to the used pile.  I never
had a problem paying for my drains if I didn't satisfy battle
order.	If you do have a problem, deploy 3 or more ties there.

Try to lure them into space....  Put enough ships at systems
so you won't get totally shmucked, but not enough
to make them not want to come to fight.  then when they hit you,
twi'lek or play lateral damage, and then beat the crap out of em.
chances are (almost every time) they lose 20+ cards.

don't forget your retrieval  retrieve 3 for the squadrons,
and use Return to Base to get them back out for another 3 force.

The asteroid is to recycle ties... I know it's hard to kill
em, they must draw a 4 for the squadrons, a 5 for ties, but
in todays high destiny world, that'll happen probaly at LEAST
every 3rd turn.

merrejk is great, drop him at the docking bay, pull a system.
immune to battle damage.

3 twi'leks almost guarantee me the effects I want.
I'm never hurting for lateral damage, Sienar fleet,
Dreaded Starfleet, or whatever.

I'd change well guarded for first strike.  If
they come to your docking bay, your gonna start
causing them damage.

I picked the Vengeance as a star destroyer choice because it's a destiny 2 (3, oppresive enforcment) and holds 6 ties, which HAS come in usefull.  mostly cause of those squadrons.
