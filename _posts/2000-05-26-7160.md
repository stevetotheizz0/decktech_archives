Strategy: '

this deck is still in play testing, i play with it at Ottawa GS and finished second.
people dont expect revo in HB so choke him beat what he deploy get the card you need with tunnel vision and tibrin then retrieve with OMDH
get it back with tibrin and retrieve until you have no card in lost
this deck is pretty solid but like i said it is still in playtesting
if your wondering why no alter...its because i dont need it most of the card i fear are interrupt so sense is more usefull. grab alter and play sense
i would like to put 2 more sense in it but the deck is tight.
against most of the deck start Goonee tay to slow him if he dont start Crush revolve even if you dont have a grabbler and if he start crush( after scouting) wait until you have one
