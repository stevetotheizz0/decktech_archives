Strategy: '

This is a basic Throne Room Mains deck with some
personal taste that works very well against most
decks. I'll refrain from a long strategy that has
already been written and just point out some
key cards that really help
H'nemtheGetting this guy early against decks
w/lots of Imperials really hurts them.
Tunnel Visionfor speed
Bith Shuffle,Shocks etc.I can track them good.
Old Obi and StickBetter drains and staying power
RedemptionCheaper mains w/the Bacta Tank

Just remember that you have to know how you are
gonna win pretty early to have an advantage

This may look all too familiar but I don't care.
It works very well in the environment around me
and I think I proved that.
Thank you for your time.
