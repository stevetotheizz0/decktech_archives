You said any space deck would waste my deck. I’ve played 3 heavy space decks one game I one by 29, another I stalled it to a timed win by 20 or so, and the other I lost by one because of a mistake that I made. That isn’t getting wasted by space.

Good stuff...I thought corran was 2 destiny...but I’ll check. Also I don’t have another Double agent but I’ll put another in if I get it.

Killa Driver
I’ll think about that one but I want to keep at least two of the odds in there but I’ll see about the effectives.
