new stuff --
outed sim aloo and added another janus
security precautions for emperor power
resistance for one projective telepathy
added two monoks and another masterful
and an it's worse
 which i can use or put back with janus

thanx to steven lewis, atkins, and bojo for your ideas

you start mobilization points & arrest order for obvious reasons and oppressive for free grabbers and when you lose SAC duels


example first couple of turns
-- go get Carida if you think you will need to generate quick like against Ops OR you got some good ships in your first hand otherwise just get DS2 docking bay, emperor's power, and drop Emperor on the bay.
next get the Endor docking bay and put Vader down ASAP if you have him and alittle backup like IGGy or 4lom. then keep drawing until you feel strong enough to drop Carida and the <>docking bay, reinforce with people -- start draining and get search and destroy rolling
i always leave dueling towards the end against most decks cause i like Vader being out there to circle Ben and now who are the only light side characters can they really use to beat you
-- eloms and super Direct damage Falcon
if you can deal with them you win

VS stevens speeders
get sarkli on the Chirpa' Hut if you get lucky and draw him otherwise drop emperor on landing platform move over to the hut -- then dig for Vader and just stay in but when you do battle better have everyone piled together on a couple sites and use molator to increase your power and draw multiple destiny

VS yannicks Direct damage
i think this is the toughest match up
get search and destroy going, cancel Anger Fear w/projective telepathy -- try to keep the three battle grounds (two docking bays and Carida) and start dueling right away -- set for stun late game to send cpt Han back to hand leaving leia to get BusheD

VS profit
start mara -- maybe it depends -- put her saber and whoever you got in your first hand down with her OR emperor draw for Vader -- grab luke, circle OR 4 Lom ben and avoid the elom beats (if that is what they are running) you should be able to contain the leias and hans running around -- use molator to increase your power to keep winning battles

VS hiddens base
get search&destroy working and dare them to come to the ground, attack in a massive clump (like atleast two ships) draw multple destinies -- projective telepathy if they try to overkill and dont leave enough to pay (it happens) then find the base while dueling --- draw for security precautions

thats it you should be able to hang with anybody
