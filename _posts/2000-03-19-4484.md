Strategy: '


This deck hasn't lost a game yet, but I've only used it in 2 tournaments and some free play.

For starters, I like Bespin and CC Guest Quarters, using Careful Planning. It helps get out Celebration, and CCGQ has a force drain -1 for the Dark Side. My favorite thing about Cloud City is that you don't have to worry about Walkers. What a relief

You should be able to tell what this deck does just by looking at it. Basically you set up big drains early. SOS is very useful, coming with his own Saber. You can drop 1 Character at each Cloud City site, and just drain. When they battle, you Path of Least Resistance your most powerful character to the battle, and wreck some havoc. If they don't come to Cloud City, just drop and drain. That can really add up in a hurry if you have Celebration, a couple Lightsabers and Pucumir Thyrss down.

Captain Han dominates Bespin. I rarely have people put up a decent fight in space. Use Bacta Tank/ Redemption and a pilot and they can never beat you off Bespin.

How to play vs. dominant DS deck types

vs. HDADTJ
This deck has the Visage killer, and duel protection. If you don't want Obi and Luke killed, just run away with Path of Least Resistance. Celebrate and drain. Avoid battles with Vader beacuse those can be painful. Boussh really helps to block Vader's drain.

Vs. Big Blue
Get drains quickly. Don't spread out your space. Stick to holding Bespin and you'll be fine.

Vs. Ops
Start Battle Plan to slow them down. Obi ROCKS against ops. Use SOS and Pucumir to drain, and Captain to stay in space. Keep them out of space so they have to pay for drains.

Vs. ISB
Just fight. Don't try to drain, just beat them up. Adapt to the ISB that they're playing.

Vs. Raltiir Ops
Ignore them on Raltiir, they can't drain you too big. If you try to attack Raltiir, that can ghet expensive. Drain and Celebrate and fight if you need to, but like I said, I don't reccomend going to Raltiir.

Vs. COTVG
Ignore them, too. I wouldn't risk getting my characters fed to the Rancor, and I have seen people pull it off. They probably can't outdrain you.
