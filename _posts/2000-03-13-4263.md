Strategy: '

The main focus of this deck is obviously to free han and then control Tatooine. Once Han is freed spread you characters out and drain your opponent heavily. If they attempt to deploy something you should be able to handle it but if you can't use It's a trap, rebel barrier, fallen portal,dodge and blaster deflection to even the odds. I almost always play the same strategy and just ignore what my opponent is doing because this deck can beat almost anything in terms of draining and considering the objective makes them lose even more force they don't have much of a chance unless they come to you. I'm pretty sure I got all the teamwork cards in here, not only do these cause massive damage to your opponent but also have the nice side effect of stacking a few 5 destinies into the deck.

here are a couple specific card strategies

I know you think im crazy for actually playing see-threepio in this deck but he actually serves many purposes. When he's with chewbacca he adds a desitiny (or, rather chewie does but theres still a destiny being added)and when he's with artoo or R-3P0 in a battle he'll be adding another destiny plus subtracting one from all of your opponents draws if with Artoo. And last but not least he can be targeted by A Gift which is a serious weapon against many decks.

R-3P0's purpose is pretty obvious especially against ISB decks where he can cause massive force lossage. And now with the creation of Mara Jade he can be a good annoyance to almost any DS deck. Finally, he is yet another target for A Gift which is always good.

Artoos main job here is to be targeted by a gift or to go in undercover and prevent some drains. He can be replaced by Momaw Nadon if you feel trans terminated is not enough visage protection.

In response to the reviewer who asks why I only play one of each main and 2 lando and leia, i DO play 2 versions of all other mains, except i feel that 2 versions are better for some others and the only cards worthy of play are Leia epp and lando ecc. And as for the one who says i will never get the interrupts i need, i have played this deck many many times and i always have what i need when the situation comes up.

Thanks for reading the deck, hope you liked it.  '
