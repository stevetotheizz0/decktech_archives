Strategy: '

I start S&V because I have 2 copies of All Wrapped Up (otherwise, I'd start with that)
Endor Occupation stop the opponent from celebrating
Hutt Smooch capture Boussh, TK-422, or Artoo w/ A Gift
Hidden Weapons a way of capturing/killing characters
Elis Helrot if your opponent is on another planet.
Twi'lek Advisor Get out those effects faster
Trap Door Utilitize the Rancor
Ghhhk in case if you're ever super-outpowered
There'll Be Hell To Pay catch any annoying interrupts
Bad Feeling Have I makes it harder for them to get a beatdown crew
First Strike use with S&V-another retrieval engine
Quick Reflexes you can lose hidden weapons and dengar's riot gun and still kick butt
Death Mark Anti-Profit
Expand the Empire old-skool alien deployment(w/audience chamber)
All Wrapped Up A must for this deck
Resistence I hate inserts
Dengar's Modified Riot Gun use with Jodo Kast. Come here Yoda )
Skiff to protect your characters from the Sarlacc
Bubo keep people where you need them, eat spies
ZiMH you only have 6 ability? what a pity
Bossk In Bus one extra destiny
Iggy in Ship  Keep him alone at a system.  they can't fight you but you can fight them.
Bossk w/ Gun capture time
Lyn Me helpful w/ bounty hunters
Mosep/ Galid force drain bounuses
M'iiyoom scan opponent's hand for rebels
Ephant keep spies out of the audience chamber
Pote helps w/ skiffs

vs. Profit start Mara and Jodo.  if you have either weapon in hand, get out the other one w/ Jodo's game text. if not, pick one.  Put the capture gun on Jodo and the Lightsaber on Mara.  Use Death Mark, and  just kick their butt.
vs. Hidden Base probe w/ the ships.
vs. MWYHLuse the ships to go to Dagobah and kick butt.
vs. Yavin 4 choke just stay on planet, let them come to you.

That's all the types I've seen at tourneys around here, I think.
If you tell me what to put in, tell me what to take out in its place
Thanx,
