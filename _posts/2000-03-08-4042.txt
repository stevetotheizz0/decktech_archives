Strategy: '

General

Start ISB and get space going quickly. Don't deploy to the ground too quickly. Try to block there drains with undercover spies and make strategic battles. In space, if they are playing a superfalcon deck, spread out and battle with lateral damage. Try to get s steady drain going in space.

Profit Start CHYBC. Don't deploy any aliens at start. Block drains. Play just like you would against mains.

Ops You will shut down there drains. Start Bright Center if you feel lucky. Flip ISB quickly if possible. This isn't a big deal to do against most decks. Drain in space and beat down if possible.

Mains Spread in space. Watch for falcon. Block drains. Battle when you know you can clear a site or do a decent amount of damage. Try to track a 5 if possible.

This deck works better than it looks. Try it on CT if you don't believe me.

**********In response to the first 3 reviews Potf out, another 5-d6 in. Took out Col Wolf Yularen for an EPP Vader.
