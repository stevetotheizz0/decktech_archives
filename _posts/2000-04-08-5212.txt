Strategy: 

Basics:

I think this is pretty easy to explain. Start either Death Star or a two-zero site so that you can get some good activation early. Start effects according to what they are playing. If they are playing ground start beating them down there while at the same time draining in space. If they are playing space fight them there and drain on the ground. This deck should be able to do well against almost any deck.

Against Certain Deck types:

vs. Ops. Start Imp Decree. Try to get out effects such as battle order and Empire's New Order. You should have their drains mostly shut down by then. Go destroy their planet with Vader's Crew while you get out Kiffex Kashyyyk and Endor for drains.

vs. MWYHL start CHYBC or IAO, Put some power into space and drain from there, you can clump your imperials up at a planet or two and keep some force set up for ellis helrot. That way you should be pretty well protected against epps. The big drains this deck can muster should take care of them.

vs. Mains and Toys. Start IAO Battle order should make the Epp's choose to play ground or space. Drain at the other one and do what you have to where they are.

vs. Hidden Base. Start Sec. Precautions. With Battle Order that should slow them down. Spread out on the ground and using Sec. Precautions you should be able to efficiently fight them in space.

Well that's about all. This deck is very hard to beat in any field. You should find great success playing it.
