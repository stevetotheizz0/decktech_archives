Strategy: '

This deck relies on three parts.

1. Flip and control the system to establish your powerful effects like Battle Plan, Celebration, Menace Fades, ...
2. Rule the ground with mains, nasty interrupts, S/A and Lift tube.
3. High Destinies  In some turns, all 0 are on the table, and you have 8 six’s, and 10 five’s to blow up your opponent.

You start with Keeping the empire out forever, Your insight serves you well and Squadron assignements.

Use your ships wisely. Super Wedge is the key. He can cancel destiny with Red8 or Tycho, 
he can also use Xwing lasers  (as well red 8).
Help him with super Falcon if needed or super Dash.
Sense/Alter will help you against Lateral Damage or others interrupts.
Controlling the system is the key. Your effects will rules and your opponent deploys +1 on cloud city.

On the ground, interior sites are great. No walkers.
Use Luke/obi epp + A jedi Resilience to hurt him with recurrent EPP squad.
Use Lift Tube to react, and protect you.
Protect your character from Saber with Weapon Levitation and Swing and a miss (also cancel focused attack and dark strike/sniper).
Finally use Path of Least Resistance/Sorry about the mess combo as a Killer interrupt.


Remember, you will flip in 3 turns. Then, it’s a tunnel vision during EACH of your turn.
So you’ll get all the cards you want and start to drain and
retrieve.

This deck force your opponent to come to you, otherwise
you will drain him too much.

Matchups

Aliens deck.
Don’t go on Tatooine (even against a Court deck).
Let him set up on Tatooine and flip. You’ll win the race 
You will drain more, and retrieve.
If he comes on Cloud City, punish him with your interrupts.
Easy matchup.

Bring Him or Hunt Down.
Be careful, it’s a tough matchup.
Let him deploy Vader on Cloud City. 
Deploy Luke on the other side of the city and let him chase you. Use your interrupts or Lift Tube to avoid him.
Attack Vader when you’re sure to kill him.

Black Sun.
Never kill Xizor and let him on his planet.
Let him deploy the Emperor and then deploy Luke on Cloud City.
If he doesn’t play with Ccity dbay, it’s game over, and you’ll win.
Otherwise, kill his guys with your epp and nasty interrupts.
This should be an easy game.

And have fun 
Tunnel vision every turn (including during opponent’s turn is VERY fun). '
