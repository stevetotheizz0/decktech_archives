Strategy: '

This deck is designed to keep your opponent guessing until your set up, hopefully by then it will be to late for them to do anything about it.


This deck is also self contained, meaning, no one should be deployed away from any of your locations except undercover spys.


Your 5th turn you should be draining for around 10, by then you shoud be set up at bespin, both sites, and some clouds. At least 1/2 of your drain should be unmodifiable because of the objective. Make sure there is alot of backup for Bespin, you need to keep that system


Try to hook up your studly ground characters with plastoid armor curtosy of the eloms, power & forefit +2, and <6 weapon destiny needed to hit are all very good things. Slso get your bothans undercover to any ground drains that hurt. 


Retrieval is also big, Celebration will give you 2 most of the game because you WILL have control of Bespin, and the sabbac playing should keep you in the money because Lando is a pimp.


The main keys to this deck are, Lando is a handy guy, keep him around and he can save the game for you, and don’t, under any circumstances loose control of Bespin, it’s nessary. Bottom line, if you loose control of Bespin and cant get it back you will loose the game.


Well, tell me what you think, any and all comments appreciated greatly. Thanks.
