Strategy: '

Basically just get out your docking bays and put speeders there for generation. Next, start dropping sites to drain at and/or lure your opponent out. From there use DTF with FA and/or Treva to beat your way to victory If they’re in space, use the Super Falc and it’s interrupts to wreck your opponent.

COUNTERS TO OBVIOUS REVIEWS

Search and Destroy is not that big a deal because unless my opponent can occupy 2 indoor battlegrounds (unless they play court this is a rare occurance), they have to walk outside, then you beat them down.

Super Falcon is enough space since all you want to do is distract them so you can drain on Tatooine with Battle Formations.

Rebel Snowspeeders are @#$% power and forfiet. Once I activate MF, one speeder is power 5 and forfeit 6 (Plus, I don’t own any rebel snowspeeders).

In Seattle, Huntdown is Freakin’ everywhere so 3 Trans. Terms are NOT excessive where I play. If they are in your area, take one out for another Signal or something.

Ounee Ta is worth it since if I come up against some dumbass playing Rops, my speeders come out for free Plus, the retrival into hand is TOO good.

There, that should have covered all the scrub reviews, I hope now I will get some helpful ones. '
