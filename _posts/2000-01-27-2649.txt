Strategy: '

Slap your Imps in the Cloud Cars and flip the objective.  Cloud Cars are better than speeder bikes and cheaper than AT-STs, compromising only 1 power.  Not bad.  FLip the objective, start pulling Clouds and setting up drains up in Clouds.  Hold an Imperial Barrier for Falcon/Han/Leia thing.  Barrier it, move away.  Then when you can, get Boba in ship out and try to kill it with Lateral Damage.  Falcon will kill this deck, but hopefully the +2 for deployment will hold them back some.  YOu may want to add Bad Feeling Have I and some Ghhhks.

You also want to track around the 5s and be drawing those for destiny.	having 8-9 in attrition isnt unusual for this deck. '
