Strategy: '

This deck tries to be a foil to all of the swarm decks out there.	Rather than stocking multiples of the same ships, I've tried going for a variety of different vessels to control systems, so that I will have little to worry from Monnok.  With Haven, most ships will deploy for only 1 force or less, and the pilots will be almost free as well.  I went with a variety of interrupts to make TBH2Pay hurt as little as possible.	The main concern for SAC are the Kessel Runs; Wise Advice should definately be out before you even think about it.  I used several systems to make probing all the more difficult (also why I kept out Coruscant)

Against Ops The Planet That Its Farthest From as soon as possible.  Between Luke, Obi-wan, and a few of your pilots, you should be able to cause some mischief for them if necessary.

Against HDADTJ Deploy your spy to the Holotheater; bring a friend if you like.  Be wary if they're dueling, this deck is a little weak in that area.

Against Big Blue Oh for fun  You may want to not deploy Ralltiir to keep their forces divided (although your Corvettes will also be trapped on their sides).	Consolidate your forces.
