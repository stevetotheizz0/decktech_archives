Strategy: '

Start Death Star and Oppressive Enforcement.

ABC + Dark Waters means that the LS can't drain on the ground, especially if you throw an undercover spy at the Cantina or Back Door or where Ithorians are.

When they come to space, Imperial Barrier their starship, then beat them down with a Lateral Damage and a few starships.

Otherwise, just drain in space - Battle Plan isn't an issue in a drain race 'cause you can activate so much, and the worst it means is that occassionally you don't drain when you go for the beatdown.

Often, Battle Plan will hurt the LS more than you, as they will have a hard time establishing a system - Lateral Damage and Star Destroyers prevent that...

Against Ops, your drains will be be only 2 or 3, but that's enough as the Operatives will be unable to drain at all.  '
