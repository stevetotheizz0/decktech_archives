Strategy: 

use palace raiders in crafts to kill the opponent when he comes to cloud city when he doesn’t expect it. when he sees the extirior sites he will think you are retarted and will try to come and kill you but you will get the better of him.

Vs Dark deal
this should be easy get fades going and keep your sites and keep pucimair alive to help your drains.

Vs Ral ops
if it is like my friends deck all i need is fades to be in effect and stay on cloud city and drain away cause you WILL NOT be affected by his fliped objective when you flip cause you will sit and laugh when you have an alien at every site.

Vs ISB
just like ral ops the isb agents -1 drain will not effect you because you flip and you will get multiple destiny to get rid of his agents/troopers and tactical support will not effect you that much cause you can just react the next turn.
