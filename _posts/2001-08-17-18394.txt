I know there are ? marks where ’s should be, that’s because of the Decktech Processor, it’s not my fault.

This deck is a repost of my previous deck since I got some lowere reviews due to some items, specifically the Seeker errata. I did not know that they errarated (or however you put -ed on the end.) the seekers until to tell truthfully the day before this was posted. I took out some cards and put in Red Leader and Red 1 so the forfeit could be added to my three other Red ships and he makes S-Foils Immune to Alter. I threw in Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Lightsaber for more draining and You Got A Lot Of Guts Coming Here. 

I don?t use Independant Operations as much as I do Quiet Mining Colony, but I based the deck around the clouds for draining, against A Cloud City Deck, don?t use The Signal and Beldon?s, trade for Heading For The Medical Frigate to pull Out Squadron Assignments and You Got A Lot Of Guts Coming Here. 

Pretty much straightforward deck, you don?t have to be a genius to use it.

Thank You.
