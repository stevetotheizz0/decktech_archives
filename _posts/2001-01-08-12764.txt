Secret Plans 

Strategy: 

This deck, as i Said earlier is my version based on S.Lewis’ Cooking a Chevin... This deck is pimpn so Well get to some strategy.

This deck lures the oppoenent to dump Insights to  grab honor, and then make them pay for it.  Now I know what your saying, if they leave it there this deck looses.   Wrong.  The high destinies are what make this deck so versatile.  The secret is on some of the cards I play and their use with high destinies makes em gross!!



Trample - track a 6 or 7 and squash the jedi, or anybody for that matter

Presensce of the Force- gives u bigger drains at the db’s

Operational As Planned- sets up dueling destinies

I have you know- when they come to the emperor, make them pay

Evader- b/c i hate a deck playing 1 or 2 revo’s

Surprise Assault x2- this card wins games.  Agaisnt speeders, ops, xwings.  Once the destinies are set this card provides beats.

Control- you win the sac war
Res Luk R’arf- Bosk gets 3 destinies and boba gets 2.  Track destinies and kiss the super falcon good bye! (tek from scott lingrel)

No Escape- allows you to correct a mistake.  Did you loose off the top and shouldnt have?  Or did they trand visage?  Drop this get a card back and oh ya, canels honor!

Weapon Levitate- get vaders stick and take away obi’s or lukes!

Put All Sections On Alert- allows the emperor to sit pretty at the ds and not worry about too much

Battle Order- crunch time on decks like profit and chadra fahns and speeders

Come here you big Coward- invade the executor and pay

Secret Plans- i hate retrieval

Ok so thats the what the cards do.  The strategy is simple but this deck takes alot ot patience to play.  It has only lost once (12-1) and thats because my brother is tek.

The deck plays such as this.  Get all your locations out.  Hold caridia if you are gonna need battle order to win. (get your ships there first).  Get vader out and pressure them with visage.	In the mean time get out Reactor terminal and set up destinies.  You should always be ready to duel.  When the opportunity come to surpise assault and your destines are good, do it!!	But i must say waiting is better for them to pile, lets say 8 ships at endor (sorry chu, nothing but love!! ;-).  Your destinies will win in the masses. Ok now for matchups...

Profit - Duel their guys away and insert.  the easiest game possible...

X wings- lure them to loose Insights, drop no escape. Insert.  Let visage hurt them and kill their spies.  Also surprise assault when necessary!!!

Mains in Space - Res Luk Rauf their falcon and no esacpe for the card back.  Also Flipped Hunt down hurts.  Await their mains and duel!

New Age throne room - Home 1 db is their haven b/c you cant move there.  So drop pof to make it a bg, pick up vader and follow where ever they go (with crush out you can loose a force to cancel clash which cancels pof)  Follow, and duel.  Visage will take them down.  Insert should also crush them.

Ebo- set up fast and insert... good game.

This deck is really tek and intricate.	Any questions dmail me!  And remember, nothing is cooler than dueling the oppoenent and having the insert pop upon the dueling damage = 23 damage = ouch!

laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate!
