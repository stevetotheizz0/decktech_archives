Strategy: '

I took the main idea for this deck from Asselins RTP deck.
I start out with the Throne Room to give me a first move start and use Careful Planning to get my Y4 docking bay out. As soon as I can, I put a droid at the Yavin 4 docking bay to let me use the scomp link access to use the How Did We Get Into This Mess? to cycle through my deck to get the cards I want to deploy. The cards I look for are the Death Star docking bay , Detention Block Corridor, either a Ronto or Patrol Craft, and two lift tubes. Once these are in place, I am set up to get Death Star plans in one turn.

Because of the high destinies of my character cards I use Never Tell Me The Odds as often as possible.

I try to get a ASP-707 at the Endor Docking Bay to deploy Ewok Catapults to set up a 7 destiny draw before either a battle or a Death Star Plans retrieval.

R-3PO is there to  deploy against ISB agents or other spies. The Bothan Spies and Momaw Nadon are there for canceling Visage or using the Bothans to add to a higher Death Star plan retrieval.

Against Ops and ISB I get Battle Plan out ASAP.

Aim High is to slow down DS retrieval.

Maneuvering Flaps is there to boost my snowspeeders power. I try to deploy them in strength at one location for a big battle. An ASP-707 deployed just before them can let me put all of them down for free. I usually try to deploy a droid on a couple of the speeders to use Dont Forget The Droids as forfeit fodder.

Surprise Assault is a nasty card when you consider my average destiny draw ,after deploying the locations, is a 4.3.  With a seven placed from the ASP-707, I usually get at least 15-18 cards retrieved from Death Star Plans.
