Strategy: '

Rather than explain how to play a Manipulator(which takes alot of practice)I'll just point out some of the specifics

Sabacc is Not the decks' themeBy the time your gonna want to play Sabacc every turn your opponent should have already used all his grabbers.

The built-in Secret Plans start is amazing as it lets you look through your deck every turn. And you still get a Starting interrupt.

Dark PathLoose 2 cards to ensure a good battle destiny.It's actually pretty good in this deck seeing as there are only 10 Characters. You'll want to have the upper hand in every battle.

Always start Any Methods/Boba w/gun/BFinS1/
CCSecurity Tower

Play Dark Deal and CCOcc. Only when you have total board and hand control.

You can effectively retrieve your whole deck if Broken Con. is on the table. Simply Keep your opponent from drawing their last card and constantly play Sabacc(youll have to track them).

Other than that this deck is pretty textbook against most prominent LS deck types
