***PLEASE Read and everything before reviewing***

This is my version of the new RalOps deck. It's come prepared to battle, Force Drain, and 'tech' out. I've only had the chance to play it three times but in all three games it's stood it's ground and won by more than 20 each time.

The essential objective is to get out the DB's w/IAO and then provide some presence there so that you can generate mass amounts of force, flip the Objective, retrieve Resistance from your Reserve deck, and watch the drains of 3 wilter to 1.
Asides from that most of us know how to play RalOps so I won't go into much detail on that. However against the three decks - Hidden Base, TRM and M&T - it pretty much went hands down.

Against - Hidden Base
Set up like normal using the Objective when flipped, get out Security Precaution and start looking for the Base - with the ships in the deck you can get to where you to and shuttle around. A 3 parsec is good for those decks that play parsecs 1 and 2 then 7, ZiMH and BFiS1 can make that 4 after probing and then move back to Ralltiir. Other than that set up your drains on Ralltiir and their planets where they have no presence. Trust me it works.

Against - Profit
This was somewhat easy. I thought it would be harder but with Blast Door Controls and Masterful Move it pretty much shut down Profit (react away w/Narrow Escape and then loose 3 from Orders To Engage) well no more. ) I'm sure I can find some other smaller things to remove to get a Sense or Two in there. Other than that just Force Drain them on Ralltiir.

Against - M&T
See above. )

Against other decks well I couldn't tell you without trying it out. However I am sure that it's secure in it's power.

Now some of you are wondering why there are so few Walkers...or how come theres no Bad Feeling Have I - Well I couldn't find space for them. In my area I want them to deploy so that I can come over there w/the Man and his bitchlet and beat you down...The deck is battle hardened and works well in most places in CA. However in your neck of the woods different things may 'tech' differently so please don't give me a bad rating because this deck is not good for your areas...but it is in mine...and if you tweak it to your playing then you'll see just how good it is.

Thanks for taking the time to read and review.
