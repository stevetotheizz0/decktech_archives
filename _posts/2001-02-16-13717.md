Strategy: '

Start with Endor Back Door and any other site, using Careful Planning. Get both Kazak and Graak down at the. Back Door ASAP. Should’nt be too long with 2 of each and the Tunnel Visions. Back them up with Tribesman and 1 Ithorian, this

gives you a drain of 4 from the reserve deck pretty early. Once you are comfortable in your setup insert the odds anddrain away. Now this does damage two ways, they have to stop your drain, so they are going to activate, if they don’t they are losing from reserve deck anyway so the odds are still coming up. Get Wars Not Make One Great and you are doing even better.


If they decide to come after you and try and stop the drains, the power 3 Ewoks, (which you should have at least 3 or 4 down by now)will survive, barely but they will. With the high destinies in this deck you should take a few of them with you. Choke Vader is rough if they end up choking your key characters at the site. If they don’t come after you you can safely spread out to adjacent sites and cause even more damage.
