Strategy: '

Hmm i dont have much of a strategy since i havent ever played this deck but ill give it a try

vs. court flip quickly and put all their stuff out of play so SandV doesnt work so well.

vs. hunt down duel flip quickly and throw some ability 4 guy at vader and out him out of play

vs. isb just fight and beat them up

vs. rops this is the problem matchup w/ this deck i think. you just have to get to their planet and try to beat them off the planet. if anybody has any tech that help beat this i would like to see it.

i guess thats about it '
