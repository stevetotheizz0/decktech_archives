Strategy
  You start with Sullust. You use The Signal as the starting interrupt, which allows you to take out an effect with no deploy cost. You take out Squadron Assignments. This allows you to get a matching pilot to a starship you have in your hand during your deploy phase (or vice versa.) You then deploy both simultaneously. There are effects that are usful like Weapons display, or Legendary Starfighter. 
  There is an interrupt combo I think could be useful when you have alot of attrion, or you don’t want to lose people there to attrition, you play This Is More Like It, and then right away you play It Could Be Worse. So in the end, if you had five attrition, you paid five to cancel it. It’s Worse could be bad, but who uses that card? You could use Combined attack (if you had a couple starships, and a couple starship weapons, or more) to kill a D*2 Executor, or a regular Executor, or Star Destroyer, etc. This is basically a swarm deck and there are a few decks out there that could kill it.  This deck does well the times I’ve used, but the first one, the unrevised one, stunk a little.
