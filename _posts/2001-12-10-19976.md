Strategy: '

**************************************************

Yeah I know I don’t have epp Han, and if I had 2 of him he would definitely go in.  I also do not have the good luke, or Ill take the leader, so make substitutions if you can get any of these good cards.  unfortunately no one in my are has these or is willing to trade them.

**************************************************


Ok, anyone who thinks WYS is weak, or doesnt cut it is just wrong.  As hayes pointed out WYS has won plenty of tournaments and is still strong even with that lame defensive shield.  I believe this is one of the more cost effective decks to build since it does not revolve around massive mains or ultra rares.  Its simply an efficient deck.  Anyways, here is the strat.


The starting stuff is pretty basic.  squad assignments is crucial, and insurrection is needed to get out the DBs.  If you want to sub in a different starter instead of Draw Their Fire be my guest, but I find it to be helpful since I am the one who usually initiates the battles.


First Turn

-Activate

-Pull a DB (preferably Home One), and deploy it

-Pull Kessel (deploy it is they are playing force choke, otherwise hold it until a more opportune time)

-depending on your hand, you may want to throw some smugglers down to the cantina, or put someone on a system.

-draw


Early game

You want to try to hold the cantina for the whole game.  Because of the new dueling objective luke may not be too useful.  Raltir Freighter captains are Gods gift to WYS, they deploy for 2 and forfeit for 6.  2 captains and talon karrd can hold the cantina, but it helps to have your Blast The door Kid incase they drop maul, vader or the emp on you.  Just cancel the battle and then beat them down the next turn. 


Mid Game

Tunnel vision for cards you need and try to get ability 7 to kessel.  the drain of three there really adds up since they will most likely be two afraid to confront you and zuck in truck wont be able to reduce destiny.  Depending on what you are playing, holding a system may only take one ship or three.  If they are heavy space get the super falcon out asap and intimidate the hell outa your opposition.  Life debt, punch it and out of nowhere can win you the game if they are foolish enough to come to you.  try to set up the celebration and retrieve the 1 or two force a turn.  It really makes a difference over time.


End Game  Your drains should be taking a major toll on their life force.  if they decide to send down kedar the black or some undercover spy just eliminate him with sorry about the mess.  recycle any used interrupts to increase your differential.


Of course every game is not going to be text book.  There are plenty intangible factors that alter gameplay, such as a poor starting hand.  This deck does have weaknesses so lets go to that matchups


Matchups


SYCFA - I hate to say it, but this is pretty much an auto win.   My friend has a really nice Set Your Course but i just creamed him with this deck.  The weakness here is they put the gunners at the D* DB, or an easily accessible D* location that just begs for a beatdown.  These decks tend to have little or no ground, so it only takes 2 smugglers to lock down the cantina.  Because WYS doesnt give your opponent too much force, they will have a hard time deploying their big ships and you will out drain them and out battle them.


Ties - not an auto win, but your ground will pretty much go unchallenged.  Try to just control tatooine so that you will be able to secure the celebration and guarantee that you can retrieve plenty every turn.  Get out your battle plan shield and Aim High to make them pay for their sienar retrieval and to drain.  the only ties I have played is my friends bomber deck and I am 1-0 against that, although it was a close game.


Black Sun - ugh, not a good match.  The only black sun I have played is an awesome force choke/podrace deck.  The shield helps, but it doesnt stop them from retrieving 11.  You can try to suspend wattos box, but holding 3 locations is tough when they are likely to have heavy bounty hunters and emperors.  I am 1-1 against Black sun with this version.  The trick is to fight for the cantina while maintaining your space drains, minimize race damage, and fight for the cantina.  Multiple battle destiny will eliminate there characters while your high forfeit minimizes your losses.


Carbon Chamber Testing - an annoying deck to play since WYS has few rebels.  Give them Theron Net.  The best strategy is to just battle them on CC, hold the cantinna (which is easy because these decks only use bounty hunters and other high deploy characters, thus they will have to save force for several turns to be be able to break the cantina), and hold a system or two and just wear them down.


Senate - I have never played against a senate deck, but I have heard that WYS can beat them if you play smart.  I would guess that you should try to outrdrain them fast, and battle any weak characters they may have outside of the senate.  


LS Combat - I havent played this either, but I think you can out drain them once you get set up, and the amount of force they give you should allow for a quick set up and a major beatdown on one of their lone jedi.


Thats all the matchups I can think of for now...


If you want some more info on the deck, D-mail me, but I think this strat is too long already and most of you know how a WYS works. '
