PLEASE READ BEFORE REVIEWING


first of all- many props to john hawkins for the original creator  of speed deal.

You usually set up second turn. quite a bit of force generation.

set up the troopers and drain.


on the ground it`s power +4 for dark deal+ power plus how many starships you`ve got at bespin cloud city and trooper assault +2.


why not the imperial arrest order combo?

because sometimes it does make a difference the forfeit plus 2 and with search and detsroy some troopers are forfeit 6.


stunning leader is very good card because if they come down with all their mains it`s better to exclude them, cause they might have chewie or someone else left and that means one thing-BATTLE DAMAGE.


occupation combined search and detsroy is excellent. some direct damge. you`ve got twi`leks for no escape and drop. control set for stun for less ability characters or the high force drain.

tactical support to speed things up.


most obvious card i`d just as soon kiss a wookie to delay things as much as possible. limited resources just for end game if it`s too close.

snoova and his vibro ax-stunning leader doesn`t count and he can capture someone.


agains stuff like wys or there is good in him or echo base, you start as quickly as possible. if you fear a beatdown get interrupts into hand and try to kick them off. against ebo drain as fast as possible before they drain you.control the vergeance if theyhave one.


against hb flip start as soon as possible got 4 sites plus bespin and cloud city to drain at.

direct damage-search and destroy and occupation will be too much.


against pod profit secret plans slows them completely. obviously they don`t won`t you to drain so they come after you. use interrupts to delay and exclude. occupation is excellent and battle and drain. '
