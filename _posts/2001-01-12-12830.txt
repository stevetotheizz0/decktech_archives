Strategy: 

Lets see, what can I say.  Yup, its another Hunt Down deck.  Yes It uses dueling.  Its basically a ground based deck, but it can hold itself against pretty much anything.  I have little tidbits of ”tech” here and there let me go over individual cards you might be questioning in my deck.


Evader & Monnok + Crush the Rebellion:	Works really well to get a monnok into your hand whenever you need one.

Masterful Move + any of the holograms in the deck.  Way cool and should be in most dark decks.

Weapon Levitiation: Just a really great card

Oo-ta Goo-ta Solo?: In my area Im seeing a lot of the new smuggler objective.  This works great because it cancels Kessel Run, Hoses Nabrum or barriers smugglers.  Pretty nifty.

Prince Xizor:  Zukkus on the ground.  This guy is a wrecking ball. He can pretty much drop anywhere and kill anything.	Wow this guy is amazing.

Everything else is pretty self explanitory.  But I will go over how I play anyways.

Start, if you have Vader in your hand drop him ASAP.  Pull a docking bay and the Executor into your hand.  Good against space.	Then just proceed to battle them.  Make them come to you with Search and Destroy and draining at your docking bays.  If you seem to be loosing the drain race or they put out Luke or Ben, go kick their a$$.  You should have enough to take care of them.  Destinies are pretty high.

Since everyone kinda already knows how to play the deck, Ill let you use your own strategy for specific deck types since it has been around for over 2 years.

Any specific questions d-mail me.  Ill be glad to answer them.
