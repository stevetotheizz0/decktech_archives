Strategy: '

Please know what Bo Shuda and Uh-Oh does before you review.

Leave Han at the AC with an Elom and Bo Shuda, get Order out and watch your opponent scramble out of the AC.

While your doing this get the CC sites out and fortify, just sit back force drain and direct damage, with BT and Landing Claws you should be able to slow most space decks. Projections for their sites.

This deck has enormous fighting potential especially with the lift tubes(again know what this card does before you review), and should be able to repel most imperials, don&#8217;t forget your safe from walkers and that Lando adds a battle destiny with another alien(Eloms) and that this deck is really high destiny.

The Insurrection is protection against Elis Helrots and pulls the dbs, but if Elis is dead in your area then take it out with the DBs as well.

Acitivation shouldn&#8217;t be a big problem you start with 5+whatever opponent gives, you can pull 2 docking bays, and 3 of the CC sites give 2.

Sorry about the mess takes care of U-3p0.

This deck also has the advantage of baffaling your opponent, as it is quite orginal.

I don&#8217;t think much more explaining needs to be done, see yah '
