Strategy: 

Use the speeders, Orri, and EPP Obi to secure the North Ridge. Use the Lucky Shots to hit walkers if they come to Hoth. Otherwise use your space force to drain and attack fleets. 

First turn use ANSB to pull EBG and an Echo location, then use EBG to pull Hobbie, Zev, Rogue 2, or Bacta Tank.

Keep pulling Echos and the other EBG pulls until you can get EBO set up. Try to get Carlist out as soon as possible to make it effectively impossible to cancel EBO until and unless he gets hit. 

ISB: Tough, because some ISB decks are Hoth-oriented. You will have to play smart, but you should be able to win. 

SYCFA: You will have to play smart in space, but you should be able to hurt them on the ground and set up some good drains.
