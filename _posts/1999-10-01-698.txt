Strategy: '

This deck was built to counter most dark side objectives.  Most all dark side objectives require some kind of ground force to flip.	This deck is designed to get the 'posse' down and beat your opponent into submission in one turn for a hellova lot of damage.  This also has some added Drazin hate.'
