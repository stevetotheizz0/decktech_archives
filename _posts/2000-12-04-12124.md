notes on revievs

  You Cannot Hide Forever is intended to pull Well Earned Command.

  I added 2 Image of The Dark Lord to compliment Visage at the table

  I believe andy is thinking of here we go again(ls endor) or the DS version is not SE, I checked all the SE interupts

changes from kill his friends explained at bottom

The goal is simple, control the ground for a solid drain base and get Vader to a battle ground early to start them losing force for Luke.

If they give you Luke and it looks like they will stay off-planet, you have enough power in the deck to combat them at thier locations.  Track 7’s and attack with the Emperor’s power to get 2-3 quick cards stacked on Insignifigant Rebellion.  Continue tracking 7’s to score an instant victory by turning Luke.

Adm Piett and Gen. Veers are the targets of Imperial Command.  Commander Igar is the target of Piett’s text.  Well Earned Command(on Igar) is the target of You Cannot Hide Forever.

On your first turn you should be able to do the following
Deploy a docking bay
Deploy the Emperor to the bay
pull and deploy the holotable via Masterfull Move(if they give you 1 force)

That is 9 force for your second turn on your own.  Enough to deploy anything in the deck.

The revolving cards are 6 and 7 destiny and can be stacked easily with Reactor Terminal and Janus.  Mix them in with a couple low destiny cards like spare lightsabers.  With all the reacting power of the scouts combined with the extra destiny from Emperor’s Power, 3 battles should be an easy task.

If they refuse to come to you, move the emperor to the ground and let him oversee the drain war.

The holotable is a great weapon.  10 times out of 10 you win battles there. Easiest way to make the pile on Insigniffigant rebellion grow.  If they refuse to battle you there it is a constant drain of 2 while Igar roams the earth.

  Executor, works well with Piett, pulled by Mobilization points.

  Dengar...  Hurts to lose all imunity to attrition don’t it.

  Boba in S1, strongest of the BH ships in my opinion...  switched Boba w/blaster to Iggy w/blaster for this one

  Bossk in the Bus, in to stop Mind train to 6 decks.  Good ship, enough said.

  Gall, Launch Point for Bossk in the Bus

I have not tested this deck agianst all deck types, but it is part of a faily good wave of wins.  I think this one will work even better than the previous one.  I appreciate your comments and reviews.

Gand.

  thanks for the revievs and comments,	a modified version of this will be up before long. '
