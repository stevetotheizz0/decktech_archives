Strategy: 

Start with:
RalOps
Raltiir
Prepared Defences
Biker scout gear

Use RalOps to pull all of your sites. Use Twi*lekÂ’s to pull your effects. Expand the game text of forest. Get your Imperials to control Raltiir (the Tempest Scouts may help with that). Start draining at Raltiir and they will be forced to come and stop them, them smack *em down!!!
The key is not to leave Raltiir.
