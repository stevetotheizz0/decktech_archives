Strategy: 

This deck uses a variety of bounty hunters to capture opponent’s characters.
Use LV and Mara with sabers with All Too Easy to freeze and cause massive damage after the objective is flipped.
All Wrapped Up is used for many captures, which can be taken advantage of with Bounty.

Against other decks:
TIGIH:	Put a Bounty on Luke and take a hunter to his location, automatically capturing him.  Then hold him in the Security Tower.
HB Mains:  Once they flop, use the Hunters in ships to probe, and use ground hunters for a beatdown.
HB Swarm:  Mass your ships and attack them, using SFS cannons to destroyy the lead ships.
R2 smugglers decks:  when your opponent goes for a Kessel run, drop a ship at Kessel to cancel it.
QMC:  get characters and Dark Deal out as fast as you can and take their characters out before they cancel it.
Other decks:  if necessary, send hunters to other planets to capture against ground, or mass your ships and take your opponents ships out against space.
