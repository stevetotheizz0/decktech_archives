Strategy: '

This deck uses a variety of bounty hunters to capture opponent’s characters.
Use LV and Mara with sabers with All Too Easy to freeze and cause massive damage after the objective is flipped.
All Wrapped Up is used for many captures, which can be taken advantage of with Bounty.

Against other decks
TIGIH	Put a Bounty on Luke and take a hunter to his location, automatically capturing him.  Then hold him in the Security Tower.
HB Mains  Once they flop, use the Hunters in ships to probe, and use ground hunters for a beatdown.
HB Swarm  Mass your ships and attack them, using SFS cannons to destroyy the lead ships.
R2 smugglers decks  when your opponent goes for a Kessel run, drop a ship at Kessel to cancel it.
QMC  get characters and Dark Deal out as fast as you can and take their characters out before they cancel it.
Other decks  if necessary, send hunters to other planets to capture against ground, or mass your ships and take your opponents ships out against space. '
