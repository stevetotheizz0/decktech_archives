Strategy: '

Simple stuff. Always Start Careful Planning to go
get a Jabba's Palace Site. If they start Cantina
or Tatooine you might wanna get Jabba's Palace...
if they start other stuff it is better to use the
Audience Chamber. Even giving HDADTJ that extra
force hasn't proven to been a problem even against
the Dueling portion of that Objective.

v. HDADTJ -  2 Spies to cancel Visage and 6 of
Obi and Luke so Visage shouldn't do positive damage.
Quite A Merc will bust Elis so they should be wary.
2 Courages and Swing and a Miss will help win the
duel.

v. ISB - A Gift should slow them down. ISB hasn't
been seen in my area in awhile. Battle Plan and
Order to Engage also hurts them.

v. Court - Converting the Audience Chamber will
help you fight off Scum and Villiany. If they can't
stop A Gift you should be able to bust them up
pretty quickly.

v. anything else - pretty much have to be flexible
as your going along. Things I'm trying to fit in 
Civil Disorder , the LS Search and Destroy , and
maybe an Aim High.
