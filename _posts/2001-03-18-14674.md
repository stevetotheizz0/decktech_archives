Strategy: '

Before anyone brings this up, Double-Crossing, No Good Swindler does work.  It says AT.  Not Present.  Han is AT the site even if he is not present.  (just like a missing character who is at the site but not present)


Also, I no you can’t pull DBs.  That’s why there are 6 DBs in this deck.


Okay, start off by getting Lando BEFORE you activate 1st turn. remember to use IAO 

each turn to get a docking bay. Double Crossing-No Good Swindler makes the opponent 

lose force up the Wazoo. Now here&#8217;s the machine Deploy Lando as the escort first turn. 

Search for Brangus with the AC. (get it with the Obj. first turn. If you draw him, get 

Jabba. Use IAO to get the CC DB first turn). By second or third turn you should have a 

DB-NGS. Play it and trade a DB for it.  It&#8217;s unique, so as soon as it&#8217;s the opponents turn, play it again. Even if they grab it, you have four copies, so they&#8217;ll still lose force. As soon as you flip, do this and retrieve it with the Obj., or battle and retrieve. Brangus makes it work awesomely. In one game, (the opponent couldn&#8217;t find their grabber) I made them lose TWENTY-FOUR force just to the interrupts. Heh 

heh. 

Now then, here are reasons for various cards 


Starship mix can&#8217;t be ignored. Anti-EBO if they play Deadbolt and such. 


Imperial Barrier Helps prevent the EPP Beatdown. 


First Strike Retrievel and can stuff their interrupts. 


YCHF Numbers Protection. 


Hutt Influence Prevents them canceling your drains. 


D-C,NGS Duh 


Jabba&#8217;s Through With You Adds a Battle Destiny 


Twi&#8217;lek Advisor let&#8217;s you get out your effects. 


<> DBs and the extra DBs Needed for Brangus 



Matchups 


HB Mains Keep your characters together to prevent a beatdown. other than that, play as normal. 


HB X-wings Stick together in space and they won&#8217;t be able to overpower you. They can&#8217;t touch your ground. 


EBO Swarm same thing. 


EBO Mains same as HB mains. 


RST Move to Endor en masse and overpower them. They can&#8217;t touch your space. 


QMC QMC stinks and cannot beat this. 


MWYHL Keep them out of everything except Dagobah. Your &#8217;Swindler should pull it out in the end. 


WYS Try to overpower them in space.  They won’t expect all 5 Bh in ships.  If you can keep away from their Patrol Craft, you should win.  Tough game, though.


Anything else So long, Sucker. 


This deck won&#8217;t give up without a fight, and can be devastating every game. Hope you enjoy it I am thoroughly open to ideas and tips. Please, give advice  '
