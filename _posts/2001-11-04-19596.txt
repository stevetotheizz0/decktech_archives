Come here you big Coward
Something special planned for them  '

Strategy: '

Tactic

Take with Mob Points the Exe into hand and try to get Kuat and Sienar 
into Hand as fast as you can. With the Tie Scouts can you drain at many
systems and when the opponent battles the scouts you can play 
ghhhk and everything is right. With the Squadrons can you retrive 
a lot of force at the Astorid Sectors. When you deploy the Docking Bays
you can deploy the Squadrons for free to DS2 and then move them to the 
Exe. The Exe must be on the Sector so maybe the Squadrons die there and 
go to the usedpile. deploy then again and retrive 3 Force. Do that so
ofthen you want.  

That’s all thanks for rating me
