description: This deck has many enclosed vehicles, so those damn epps can't shoot at you. Also, there's a very big space presence, so you won't have a big problem if the falcon drops by.

Strategy: 

Well, this is basically a variation of a beatdown deck, it does especially well against Epp's, because they can't fire their weapons. You get plenty of force activation, and plenty of sites that won't really be affected by Revolution. Plus you have many effects to dampen the opponents strategy, so choose carefully which effect you'll use, because you'll have to start with different ones probably every game, ex. start SP against Hidden Base, ABCTTU against Ops, Imperial Arrest Order against Mains, and Battle Order if you just want to be mean:). I don't know about everyone else, but I always have at least 2 controls in every deck, because they're too good to not use, but many may disagree. But this deck an be changed to fit the local Meta, it'll work almost any way you make it.
