Strategy: '

This deck uses brute strength and effects to kill the oppoent. Get out Scum and Villany to help lower the deploy and let you retrieve force. With Tatooine Occupation and the front of the objective, it will make your opponent come to Tatooine. Capture the character using Bossk w/ Gun, All Wrapped Up, Denger&#8217;s Modified Roit Gun, Feltipern Trevagg&#8217;s Stun Rifle and the other cards. This will flip the objective and allow for you to get out the Rancor and Sarlacc. Also, use Binders so every character forfeited can be captured. Using the backside gametext and the text of the Sarlacc and Rancor along with the Rancor Pit&#8217;s text, you can easily retrieve force and make your opponent lose it. Use Elis to quickly move your characters to other planets, and to help capture them. Deploy Expand the Empire on Chamber to allow you to get 3 aliens out of Reserve Deck. Now for a look at individual strategies.

Against Space and Swarm Decks
=======================
Use Twi&#8217;lek Advisor to get out Search and Destory instead of Scum. This makes it so they more easily lose force. Since there are more than enough characters, you won&#8217;t lose force from the front side of the objective. Then deploy the Characters in Ships, like Bossk in Bus, IG-88 in Fork and Zuckess in Hunter. Then get out Boba Fett, CC if possible but with Gun will do, and Slave I. I use him instead of Boba in Slave I, cause he can get off when you want him to. That&#8217;s just what I do. Also, if you can, get out Jabba&#8217;s Cruiser with Jabba aboard. With this amount of ships you should be able to stop some of the force drains. But again use Search & Destroy and the front of the objective. Also, force drain as much as possible. If you hurry you can beat them in the drain race. Swarms and Space aren&#8217;t very common in my area, that&#8217;s why there isn&#8217;t much against them, but I think I gave enough.

Against Mains and Profit or Die Decks
===========================
Get out All Wrapped Up. Also, get out your characters with weapons. When the oppoent begins to deploy it&#8217;s mains and other big characters, initiate a battle. Fire the weapons at the mains. Don&#8217;t worry if you hit him or her, because when the oppoent forfeits him, because of All Wrapped Up, you can capture them. Feed them to the Sarlacc. This will place them out of play and are unplayable. Then battle and drain them until they&#8217;re done.

Against MWYHL/ SIYC Decks
=======================
Seven Easy Steps to Destory Training Decks
1) Play He Is Not Ready.
2) Deploy Guys With Guns.
3) Load up Bossk In Buss.
4) Fly to Dagobah.
5) Land and capture Luke and/or DOS and Yoda.
6) Feed to Sarlacc and Rancor.
7) Rinse Pits and Repeat.

Against Recuse The Princess Decks
=========================
Occuy the Death Star Prison and take Leia out. Move her to your Dungeon and keep her Well Guarded. Then, feed her to a creature and let her be placed out of play. With their objective gone, the opponent will be like a chicken running around without its head. Battle and drain the opponent into submission.

Against Operative Decks
=================
Battle them. This is what you have to do. This will allow for you to retrieve force, from S&V, and also to capture some guys to feed the hungry beasts. If you can capture mains, then quickly do so.

As you can tell, this deck isn&#8217;t perfect. It&#8217;s still under construction, and I will post updates as I get new cards. It has it&#8217;s flaws like any deck but I think it&#8217;s pretty good against decks in my area. Please if you have any suggestions for this deck, please let me know by emailing me at Codeguy256@aol.com. Thanks a lot
