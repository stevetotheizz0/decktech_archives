Strategy: 

This deck is mad!  It's pretty powerful and can drain for lots, as well as easily beat down the opponent.	You should be able to easily win battles at one side of the board while draining at the other side.  Start IAO which makes all your scrubs forfeit +2 which is nice.  Beatdown when necessary.
