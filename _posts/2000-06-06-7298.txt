Strategy: '

The idea is to flip the objective asap.  Most of the time start Bad Felling Have I so most mains deploy +4 to raltir.  Or start insurrection so they can nabrun over for the beatdown.  Use the objective to search for raithal.  Start the odds game wioth your total being fifteen or thirteen depending if you have out onith.	Dont play onith if they already have some mains out.  Pretty much beat them with odds then retrieve with the ornament.	Thanks.  Morgan.      '
