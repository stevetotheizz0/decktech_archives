Strategy: 

Like I said imp occu for jungle and wakellumi and twi lek for sienar fleet.  Go to one of your 3 systems fast and get out the big drain. Tallon roll starfighters and beat up the big @#$%.  Keep retriving going with returing ships to used pile with sienar fleet + asteroids and tie assault squads.  Excellent surprise deck and quite strong in the current enviroment.
