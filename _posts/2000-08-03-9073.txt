Strategy: 

This deck uses the front side of Court ONLY. You don't want to flip it so don't bitch about not being able to.

What you want to do is use the obj to get the Tat: DB 94 ASAP. then sit one of your ability 4 bounty hunters there for 3 generation (be aware of what they're playing, you may want to reinfore that location or just fortify the Audience Chamber). Try not to deploy your pilots to the ground unless you really need to.

Also in your first turn you want to get out Gall with Mobilization points. It's a quick space location to start setting up at if you don't draw any others.

Get Scum And Villany as quickly as possssible to decrease the deploy cost (some of the pilot/ship combos are expensive).

There Is No Try is in there to protect DM, JTWY, S&V, etc., from SAC. Make them pay if they feel it is absolutely neccessary to SAC you.

Use Dark Maneuvers to protect your ships from X-wing cannons and other starship weapons.

Now for what to do against specific decks:

Vs. MWYHL
Get out Broken concentration early with the Twi'leks, just to slow them down a bit. Then get one of your ships to Dagobah and launch a landing party to take out their trainee or the mentor (most likely they will only be using one or two of each, so you may kill their testing altogether.

Vs. LS Space (HB)
Build up your forces before jumping into any major battles. Try to do as much damage as possible on the ground. Utilize your AO and the Dark Maneuvers as much as possible.

Vs. Anything else
Drain in space and attack on the ground. Annoy the hell out of them. HAVE FUN.
