I Did It  '

Strategy: '

This is a basic WYS deck that i’ve only play tested a little, and  i went 2-1 in a local tournament with it. The basic strategy is to keep it on Tatooine. Get Lando w/gun, Chewie w/ gun, Han w/ gun, and Jedi Luke all at one site. Use Don’t Get C-ocky and flip the Objective and i get 4 battle destinies. One Quick thing i need to change, take out all the  raliter Freighter Captins,1 for space concerns,1 for Run Luke,Run and 1 for Melas . I may change the deck later. Feel free to ask me about something.
