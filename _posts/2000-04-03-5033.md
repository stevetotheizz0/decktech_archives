[TECH UPDATE] - For those of you that are not able to look at a decklist and see the tech therein, I guess I have to explain it to you jabronis.

Casino + Expand the Empire = a safe place to play sabacc, nestled away in the prison.  the site setup goes carbonite chamber/security tower/casino.  That way I can still retreive and not be susceptable to beatdown.

Why trooper sabaccs? You don't retreive with them.  Well I'll tell you why.  If for some god awful reason my opponent catches my CC sabacc, I can still cause more damage with the trooper sabaccs, and besides lando still adds one or subtracts one.  And before you say he doesn't, you had better go read him again.
[END TECH UPDATE]


This deck takes an experienced person to play it well.	It relys on perfect timing and knowing when to play certain interrupts.

Frustration - gets rid of catch cards
Scanning crew - Rebel or no

the epp hit squads that constantly recurr are amazing, they just deal with characters that are annoying, and die.  Next turn they return as you retreive by winning sabacc.  I still don't know why more people don't play sabacc, with the casino, you have a chance to deal your opponent damage and you gain life all in one card.  It's amazing.  '
