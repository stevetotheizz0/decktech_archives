Strategy: 

Forgot about ISB?

I thought i give my old ISB-S deck another try and updated it with the new cards. I think it has a good chance against the upcomming WYS decks, because it almost shuts down all their drains on Tatooine while giving you some good drain potential at interior sites, where no patrol craft or whatever vehicle shows up. 


Starting stuff: Square, Prep D., Power of the Hut, No Bargain, Secret Plans...use POTH to download the characters and
Hutt Inluence, Use Secret Plans to search Shocking (check if you activated T:Jabbas Palace). Goal is to get some heavy
drains going at the Audience Chamber and the Lower Passages and in case Jabbas Palace. Gailid and the Flip side of the
Objective will give you drains of 3 at those sides (make it 4 with POTF). To protect your drains use the barriers and 
None Shall pass.


Against WYS:

You shut down their drains on Tatooine (except Cantina). So the only real problem will be the drain at Kessel, but you have Bargaining Table, feel free to use it to chancel the Kessel drain! Along with your retrieval (S with First Strike, 
ISB flip side, AO on ORS), this deck can provide a good matchup against the current WYS decks. Use the push card to grap Harvest!


Hidden Mains / Y4 Mains

I never lost to those decks with the old version and i believe the new version hasnt got any problem with them to. If you put some early pressure on your opponent, using the big drains, they will be in trouble. HM and Y4 mains need some time to setup their activation, so if you hurt them early they will be in big trouble. They will try to establish a presence at JP, so use your barriers and none shall pass wisley. If they are running On and Off the Edges, grab the recycling sixes (like Throw me.. and and Fall of a legend)


EBO

Same as HM and Y4 mains: early pressure will be the key to win against EBO. Against Swarm S would be handy, but you only got 60 cards you can use....Use the high forfeit of the ORS to reduce your battle damage to the minimum and then retrieve them via the Objective.



Projective Telepathy: use it to retrieve with S / First Strike and then chancel the battle

Sunsdown/Too cold...: Just in case somebody plays Patrol Crafts with WYS..plus your spies deploy -1

DF/Hutt Smooch: Protection against UC spies

Dengar with Blaster Carbine: good to shoot down nasty vehicles
Hutt Influence: just to make sure you drains wont be modified or chanceled

As for Revo: I havent seen any Revo in the last 4 month, so i dont fear revo...

Thats all, have fun with it...and give it a try !!
