Strategy: '

Update This is in the Top 10 WTF? Oh yeah got a reply to not enough ships, that’s about as many ships as I’ve always played in my decks except in my DPC deck where i played with only 1, cause HB is never a problem cause no one here plays it so.



Update Damn that’s true can’t start drop ah well switch it up for the grabber



Another thing don’t take this deck as a super serious type thing, unless i changed this a bit I wouldn’t play it in a tournament, but this was built using extra cards not in my main decks so. I was going to use the Utinni tech Jawa but i wasn’t about to look through my crap for utinnis



First you’re probably thinking ”You are playing with Jawa’s because...?”


Well I was looking through my commons took notice of one of them, Power +1 reduce force drains, got me thinking. But it came to the whole jawa problem the stupid deploy so i check the CRD STG or whatever they call it now look for jawa, modifiable values n stuff find nothing ask on the BBS someone said they are reduced by Jabba Scum n stuff so I figured why not.


You’re now thinking ”The Camp will own this”

Well when i see someone here play the camp i guess they’ll own me until then...


Ok so Character choices

4-LOM With Concussion Rifle  

This guy is the EPP Killer


Arica

Corran Horn may hurt her but, she’s can be a life saver in the first couple games in a tournament if you come up against a scrub with the hyperdrive obj


Aurra Sing  

She’s the next Djas Phur cept she’s better and steals dead people’s sabers


Bib Fortuna  

This is a MKOS deck him and Jabba make your destinies +2 and he gets pulled with POTH


Boba Fett With Blaster Rifle  

Duh


Boelo

Jabba’s Tarkin.. who gets pulled w/ POTH  


Chall Bekan  

Obvious


Cloud City Engineer

Damn profit    


Dengar With Blaster Carbine  

same as Boba


Dr. Evazan & *Ponda Baba  

cheap deploy good power.. well most of the time


Ephant Mon

lifesaver


Gardulla The Hutt  

some retrieval.. unless they want to track 1s and 2s


IG-88 With Riot Gun  

he’s iggy


2 Jabba

 Adds forefit to the Jawas and makes them deploy nice and free


5 Jawa (EP1) 

Power 2 and reduce force drains


1 Mercenary Pilot 

Him + Barge= gold


1 Nebit

Dude’s a destiny adder and subtracter  


1 P-59

he shoots stuff  


1 Prince Xizor 

his text can be useful 


1 U-3PO (Yoo-Threepio)  

Another spy cept Corran won’t hurt you that bad..cause no beatdown


3 Wittin  

My Rep.. makes the jawas power 4.. nice bonus


How you play it


Turn 1 non profit

Grab AC.. if available grab Hutt Influence otherwise grab Empant or Bib. Now if you’re getting good activation this first turn start setting up your AC with Jabba or Chell and posse. otherwise draw up a couple.


Turn 2

You’re getting atleast 7 force this turn so now you can set up how you see fit.


Turn 1 against profit

Start Jabba and Chall at the AC (grab the Engineer) Now usually I’ll use AC as my starting JP site and convert it to lower their first turn activation and deploy someone -2 from reserve deck to shore up your force there. If you can flip this turn or next with the hand you have grab bib with POTH if you can’t grab emphant.


More Card Choices

the podracer.. people are getting arrogant not putting as much podrace interrupts so you never know every now and then you may be able to pull something off


The Barge

Pulls a Twix site.. makes my guys deploy cheaper POTH makes people on it immune to att <6 ect ect




If you have a question about the deck as to what why? or why not, contact me by AIM (COTEB1) or Dmail or something before you review it just so you can be sure as to what the deck is supposed to do before you give me a review.


 Thanks for takin a look
