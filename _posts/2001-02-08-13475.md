Strategy: '

My first attempt at WYS.  Any and all criticism appreciated (just keep it nice and simple). =)


Of course the strength of this deck is the ability to play interrupts from your Lost Pile, hence the large number.  I generally don’t play with this many, but the opportunity to use them can’t be passed up.  I’m new to DeckTech, but have been playing since the game was released, so I feel pretty confident in my knowledge of the cards.  Unfortunately, I haven’t been heavily in the tournament scene for some months now, and I would love input on how this would stack up against archetypes that are floating around at present.


Reasoning behind some of my card selections


--With the inclusion of I’ll Take The Leader, I wanted to maximize my potential ground drain by adding the <>Spaceport Docking Bay.  I can also pull it at the beginning of the game if necessary.  Mos Eisley is my ability to get clear of the Cantina and both docking bays in a hurry if necessary.


--Darklighter Spin is my anti-Guri card.  She wrecks my added draws in space, so with the Falcon, Red Squadron 1, and Red 5 all having a 6 base maneuver with their matching pilots, I’d like to think I could get rid of her by attrition.  A Few Maneuvers is included in the event she shows up against someone of lesser maneuver (Red 10, Skate, Outrider).


--Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout is included rather than a third copy of Jedi Knight in the event I need his vehicle game text or want to feed Luke to a BHBM deck (thus leaving those two 6 destinies floating in Reserve for later) and clear Vader out of the way.


--Cantina Brawl is a fun way to clear out the Cantina before moving back in to it.


--Noble Sacrifice is chiefly for Wedge (up to 12 if he’s with Talon).


--Don’t Underestimate Our Chances can be brutal if backed up with I Know and/or Punch It


--Tatooine Celebration is simply a way for me to try and get back a few a turn, as the system should be very difficult for my opponent to kick me off of.  It’s A Hit is in there for the same reason.


I haven’t played with this deck yet, so match-ups would be hard to predict.  I’m primarily looking for pointers or suggested changes (please include what you think I should remove, as well).


Thanks for your time
