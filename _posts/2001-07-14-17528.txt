Strategy: '

It’s pretty simple.  First turn, pull Madine with Strike Planning and save your force.  Second turn, deploy Madine to the War Room and use him to get Beezer, her for the Electrobinocs.  Now your set, you can use the binocs to set up all of your destinies, especially for On The Edge.  Once Padme is out, so are Obi and Qui-Gon.  Get the Outskirts out and here comes Luke.  Space is semi weak, but Coruscant is a good drain.  I always put Tantive and Masanya down together, the leave Spiral to react.  it works well.  Losing Track and A Jedi’s Resilience are in the deck mainly for destiny, but they have their uses too.  Hope you like it.
