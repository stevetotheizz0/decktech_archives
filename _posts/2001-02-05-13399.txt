Strategy: 

This is a fairly straightforward SYCFA using unique fighters and Star Destroyers, along with two bounty hunter ships for their unique abilities.

If SAC is common in your area, start TinT&OE instead of Battle Order

Card Explanations:
Corporal Grenwick- allows the Death Star Sentry to deploy free, doubles its modifiers, and makes it able to use all three as well as making it non-unique.

Heavy Fire Zone- to bring out weapons to take on my opponent’s forces, also a nice recyclable destiny 5.

FCI-you are using fighters with separate permanent pilots, except the hunter ships, which make up for the power -2 with their special capabilities.

Use Moby Points to pull Wakeelmui and Twi’lek to pull SFS (after Battle Order if you didn’t start it).

Matchups:
EBO-  overpower them in space and send in Darth and Arica with sabers along with Tarkin to go after them on the ground.

HB-  harass their forces until they flip, then use the Death Star and Kessel as staging areas to probe planets.

MWYHL- ignore their testing and focus on draining and destroying anything they put up against you.  You will be able to win it through battle damage or just drain them to death.

RST-  tough matchup, but possible if you can get Arica and Vader in place to attack their scouts as they deploy.

WYS-  just overpower them in space, because a normal WYS deck is limited in how many ships it can get out because of the +6 restriction.

TIGIH-  keep your Imperials away from Luke and use Arica to sneak up, then use her breaking cover to fire a weapon to hit him.  Put an Imperial at the Landing platform if possible to limit your opponent’s options.
