Strategy: '

Against Hunt Down, start Goo Nee Tay.
Otherwise, start Wise Advice.
This deck is ECC-compliant. When ECC becomes legal, this deck doesn't need to be changed too much to remain effective. This was played in DecipherCon, and didn't lose a game in two tourneys and a few friendly games. <BR>
This deck utilizes the first Jedi Test. It uses an ability-4 character as an apprentice, unless the opposition starts Broken Concentration, which would mean that the apprentice doesn't matter (you can test Wedge or Momaw, and get the same results). <BR>
Vs. Ops Get Bacta Tank and Battle Plan out ASAP. Use recurring mains to wear the opponent out.
Vs. Hunt Down Use the abundance of Out of Commissions to scare the opponent. The Glancing Blows and high destinies will help against Duel. Use Transmission Terminated against Visage of the Emperor. Insurrection, Projection of a Skywalker, and Test 1 can really hurt Vader's chances of draining at a site. <BR>
Vs. Dark Deal objective The key is Test 1. Get the sites out ASAP and train suh'm to keep the effects of Dark Deal away from you. <BR>
Vs. Raltiir Ops This will be the tough match-up. Use Bacta Tank and Battle Order to force the opponent to react. Wear them down.

CONSTRUCTIVE ideas for the deck would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
