Strategy: '

I Usualy don;t post my decks twice in one day, but as nobody seems to care about the strat (and the EDITS there I post it again with new decklist;and some other smaller chances that should make it stronger)


ok...USUALLY i start building my decks with a list of chars i want to fit in...this time i started with the red cards...therefor its maybe a little char light...but it still works pretty good... 


i acctualy planed to play tat celeb, but couldn;t fit enough starships in there...those three MIGHT be enough in other parts of the world, but they haven;t any at my place...so no battle plan either...


ok the rpo combo is the most important card in there...pull it out of your deck (by TV or luck as soon as poss) but hold it back maybe to surprise your op with it...rememebr they are matching pilots for falcon and so on...deploy them and two small smuggler (lets say total power of 6) pull out artoo i have a bad...or i ve got a bad feeling...HAVE the other in hand hopefully ;)...and triple his damage well you SHOULD deploy somewhere where he hasn;t got less power then you...but 30 Battle destinys can easily do the job...even better with the mains han and chewy and c3po/r2 against lets say vader and mara with emp on table? add another slight weapon malf and you get 05 battle dest...and he got battle damage (with average dest 2-3) 29-44 minus forfeit vader (8) and mara (7 or 8? not sure) 13-31 battle damage...well guess thats a won game...should be 


you might want to fit i;ll take the leader in there...maybe for a sorry bout the mess would make your destinies better and would improove your force drains...hmmm ya i;ll think heavily about that...but on the other hand i don;t realy PLAN to play lot in space, cause i fear the DS independant starships... 


harvest&On the edge...well retrieve on the edge and high destiny, track destiny TV for on the edge...or just play it from the lost pile if you have to...as always... 

noble sac is in there, because those smugglers have just incredible forfeit...and it nearly always pays off 


I added one droid shutdown as someone proposed I know two would be better but I don’t quite find a card I want to sack...


I fited there;ll be hell to pay in aswell mainly because Im building a vengeance deck right now with defensive fire, and I always fear that my opponents will have the same ideas as I do, so Im prepared against my own decks


Go Nee Tay, I forgot about that one in the first go aswell incredible strong with WYS due to the unavailability of alter be sure to play it AFTER you flip might be a bad surprise if your opponent uses his soon useless alter with that evil grin on your just deployed Go


Ok I just assembled the deck and gonna playtest in tomorrow, then I’ll post a V3 of it ;)


please REVIEW and maybe have a look on my other decks...as i’m a decktech newbie they are pretty acctual aswell 


cheers
