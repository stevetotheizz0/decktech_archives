Strategy: 

Since Bastian already posted the original version and explained the general strategy pretty well, I will only be explaining the differences in this deck.

Space Package:
The largest difference between my deck and the original, is that my deck packs significantly more space and more space support cards. The Dreadnaughts are great since I can load up forfiet fodder, move my ties around, or put my Admirals on board to for Imperial Command. Scythe 1 & 3 are awesome ships that not only have high destiny, but can shoot during move phase, and can also Tallon Roll. The ’I Can’t Shake Him’ is great way to get a weapon and recyle a 5, and can even add a battle destiny! The main reason for all this space, is to counter WYS, (hence why I also added a Battle Deployment, great against WYS, and gets me my Vehicles).

Well, that’s all I really have to say, for a in-depth strategy on how to play this kind of deck, go see "All Your Base are Belong to Europe" and read the strategy there, then compare my deck, and then make your judgement.

Whatever.
