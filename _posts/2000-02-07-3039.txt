Strategy: '

dont panic before giving me a half star
hidden base is not a problem just wait until he flip than deploy boba boat
and put vader at meditation chamber like this he need a 7 to get boba out and even if he succed you can still retrieve him, track it and draw
he cannot make beet down on it because of security precaution.
he have to pay for is drain
during this time give boba a trip and let him probe
protect your visage with sense and if he cancel it retrieve and twilek to get it back.
protect your casino and battle
epp dont hurt he draw no more than 2 destiny you choke hit with saber cancel a destiny a draw 5(i have you now and a real hero)
and dont forget to gamble retrieve, gamble retrieve and kill your opponent
