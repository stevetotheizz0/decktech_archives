Strategy: '

it works really well against the meta decks that are there to stop WYS.  it smokes You May Start Your Landing like no other.  It has enough activation (and qui-gon) to stop scum, and if you play it right, then you should be able to stop brangus if you grab Control/Tunnel Vision and Put All Sections on Alert AND take over and drain at death star sites (both of them) and play the bomarr monk at shmi’s hut.  you get the bacta tank in play and there’s nothing they can do.  another card to add against Brangus would be End of a Reign.  save four force and stop epp vader every turn, get it back with the Naked Droid, and make sure you have a 4 forfeit character sitting with the monk.
