strat 

i’ve searched for a new light deck, after i played my last regional with QMC i needed a new fresh deck, so i decided
to try light side combat, it looks pretty nice to me after i had played against it in the regionalfirst i played it with
3 effects but later on i recognized that their is no force retrieval and with this high dests it will be cool to race, so 
put in podrace and just "Sai’torr Kal Fas" for my jedis at naboo.

try to pull out fast jedis to naboo so you will give fast high drains it’s very simple and there is no really new strat or 
amazing ideas from me


Why Alter?

alter is tech, yoda will pull it out and later on in the game you will recognize why alter is a biest card, example scam or 
other s.ucking effects

thx for reading/rating this deck
