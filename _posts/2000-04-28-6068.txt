Strategy: 

Hopefully by now you don't think I'm crazy. Here's the deal, you setup your ORS in the Tempest Scouts and the AT-AT's. When they finally come to battle you, they will suffer losses that will sting for the rest of the tournament. You may lose force, but the forthcoming Sandwhirl will take out those pesky mains. The At-St's will react and save your ass, and the deserts being battlegrounds will give you better drain potential. I realize the generation is low, but once their folks are missing you will have all the time in the world (well at least within 60 minutes) to setup. AND MAINS IS NOT A PROBLEM! YOU JUST HAVE TO SURVIVE ONE BATTLE AND THEN SANDWHIRL THEIR MAINS!!! The docking bay and the drain +1 sites are not in because I cannot deploy a sandwhirl to them. AND I'll probably change something for a Point Man.. probably a sandwhirl. The Controls are in there so You can redeploy your sandwhirl provided you have another one in hand. Trample isn't in here because I don't trust my destinies (spelling?) and sandwhirl will hurt them worse than their guy dying. YOU CAN'T ALTER SANDWHIRL.
