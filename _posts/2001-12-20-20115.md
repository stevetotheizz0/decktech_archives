Gungan Strategy



	Hey, Laugh if you want, but I personally saw this deck hand a Bring Him Before me deck It&#8217;s own @#$% on a plate. The basic strategy of this deck is just that Basic. 

	The ideals of this deck are Retrieval, battle, Retrieval, battle, and hey, Retrieval. You need to try to lose Gungans to drains, because on the flipside of the objective, retrieval becomes sick. Keeping  Owen and Beru at the Farm is definetly a Good thing, because they retrieve ANY 4 cards from Lost Pile. Then, if you are decent at tracking, battles become deadly to the opponent. For example, drop Han, Chewie, and the Falcon, play life Debt, then draw 4 destinies, Crack the immunity on Executor, then lose falcon to cover what little if any battle damage there is. Basically, if you can keep this baby flipped, you&#8217;re golden.


	Vs. Huntdown Pods


	You don&#8217;t really hold much of a chance, but pull out the defensive shield, and occupy your battlegrounds. Hopefully you can make them hurt enough with drains that they can&#8217;t really get a handle on stopping your retrieval machine. Dropping jar jar with a tracked electropole is your best shot for whacking Vader. Another good bet is a Leia and Chewie with a protector. Owies.



	Vs. Senate


	This deck should take a while, but you have the upper hand. Just make sure that you do have the endurance to get their lifeforce down, and then pull some crazy mad retrieval skills



	Vs. Droid Objective


	You should definetly have the upper hand in this game, as your gungans should be able to waste some of those droids, plus when they flip, Han, Chewie, and the Falcon make that battleship call them daddy.



	Vs. Lightsaber Combat


	This game could go either way, but they definetly have the upper hand, so If you want to get them off your back you have to go and combat maul. Otherwise, the game is over before it starts.



	Well, if any of you ever get the inclination, here is a deck that noone will see coming. However, don&#8217;t expect this deck to go better than 2-1 in Sanctioned tourney play. If you have any changes you want to make, by all means, e-mail me at Lackey16@hotmail.com
