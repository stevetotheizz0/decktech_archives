Strategy: '

This deck is kinda weird...running off a good card advantage system based around old No Shelter. Mains pack a powerful punch and Beggar is REALLY aggravting. I had one guy complaining that he would contact decipher and tell them how broken it was...DTF/Beggar screws Ops and theres no real counter for it. You can beat Ops in one battle with Adders, Obis move away text, sabers. Hunt Down wont be dueling much until EJP...too many other cards to pack. So glancing blows will have to be itt for duel protection, however force is strong with this one has proven to be my best Anti-HD cards yet.ISB gets screwed like Ops. Coruscant is a pleasant surprise against non-heavy ship packers or against people who chuck there ships when they see lots of ground power and no systems for a while. Good deck..dont believe me play me online[IM Shadow865. My CT wont let me connect so It'll have to be AIM or AOL Chat Sorry =(	] '
