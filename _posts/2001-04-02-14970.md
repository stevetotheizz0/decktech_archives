Strategy: '

 
 So there is my Snivvian-Deck


 First I ever wanted to play a Agents In The Court Deck

 since I read in the SCRYE Magazin is strong in Ralltiir.


 But if I build this Deck it becomes only a funny Deck.

 Why I play with Snivvian, I read a Snivvian and read

 Power +2 under "nighttime conditions" and May deploy as

 a "react". I think that is cool, and I wanted to play with

 Nigthfall.Then I think what Characters I can also but into

 hmm Spies deploy free. I take Corran Horn and Lando w/Vibro Ax.

 Then I need a charater to take my Snivvians lesser out then

 2. But into Tessek and Snivvians reacting for 1 Force


 I know I have many 0’Destinys but I will take it out with my

 Rep Geezum, he can take Sites into hand. Only

 Proplem is he must be at an extirior site.

 First geht him out on a exterior Site with support.

 Take out the sites and draw to become Tatooine System.

 Use The Signal to get Nigthfall if you not draw it. 


 Then I use Tatooine Celebration for Retrieving,

 with the Pulsar Skate, the Outrider and the Super Falcon

 I think I can handle the System, and I use Spiral for

 raecting( I like reacting cards). Take out your 2X-3KPR droids

 and make your Snivvians to power 5 Monsters


 Get Bargaining Table to block opponents Force Drains. And Drain

 on Tatooine. Please tell me by Reviewing what Card can I but in, and

 what can I take out. What is better, Please reviewed it. '
