Strategy: 

This is a deck I've played for quite a while now although it has been altered a few times
 since the release of Endor. It is unbeaten in playtesting and it's real fun to play. There are
 five Vaders and three Tarkins since the most powerful method of dueling the boy and the
 old man is by initiating a battle and then a duel and if needed: cancel one of their duel
 destinies with Tarkin. This way you might get an unexpected help from the Son of the Lord
 or Obi might leave the table for good.
       I usually start with Security Precautions unless they're playing operatives (start Battle
 Order). I use Elis to be able to get my battle squad around. Use Masterful Move to get
 Monnok when you think it will hurt. Keep track of your destinies and Trample as much as
 you can. Don't leave Vader force draining without a vehicle or a few sense since your almost
 dead if he gets missing.
       I've added two starships, CHYBC and some Sense and Alter to be prepared for a few
 different strategies.
       The dueling cards are only to  be used when you have tracked a destiny and it's not the main
goal for the deck.

Thanks for your time.
