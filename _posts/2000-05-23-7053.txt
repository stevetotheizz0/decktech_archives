Strategy: 

As I finally got Mara I decided to sit down and make an effective dueling deck. I looked around the net and found docking bays and Gabe's deck looked good. So I made each and melded them into one deck, hopefully that still works well. Now I know this has been done before and all but still, don't review based on that. Review based on the deck and the cards used. Thanks.

Deck by deck--------

Mains: Advantage me. I can battle and duel efficiently with this deck. IG88 is a menace. He wrecks them. Use visage when you can. You should win convincingly.

Inserts: Get set up, use torture when possible. Duel hitnrun EPPs. Battle others. Drain when you can. Take inserts if you have too.

Hiddenbase: set up drains. Get search and destroy goin. Send ships up late to probe. Duel. Duel. Counter Assualt too.

I think this deck is 'gas'. Thanks.
