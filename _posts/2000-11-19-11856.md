Strategy: '

The changes I made were  Tunnel vision for a main power generator, two green squadron a-wings for the mon cal cruisers, and red leader in red 1 for home one.

While testing, I realised this deck is generating
massive force.	I tried to get two tunnel
visions in, but couldn’t do it.  I took out the big ships because the threat of hidden base and ebo combined is enough to scare any opponent that
hasn’t seen your deck, or even those who have.

I’m keeping Obi and Obi stick in for two reasons,
immunity to attrition and force drain bonus.

I’m keeping sense instead of changing it for an
alter because the sense can still cancel a sense.

Keeping the arcona because i can protect them
with sense and houjix and can grab them with
chimes to set ebo up.

I would like to get anakin’s saber in just in
case i can get drains under the shields.

Don’t forget about gift of mentor for finding
saber, or for adding destiny.

Best case scenario for ground attack gives
you 6  destiny and 19 power with obi, luke, leia,
and lando.

Last time I tested this deck, I got ebo up on
the second turn.

Strategy

get mothma before you activate.

when getting a system your first turn,
look to see if you have(if not in hand)
1)A new secret base
2)The signal
3)Main Power Generators
4)4th Marker

If you have tunnel vision in your hand and
need one of these cards that aren’t appearing
in your reserve deck, use it if you need.

Do your best to keep all activity on hoth.
You can drain for two in best case.

When you have one or both houjix in hand, spread
out.

Any interupt or effect you get cancled, goes
back into your used pile with wise advice.

not playing endor because if i’m not mistaken,
it won’t be a battlefield.

would like to use another general, but mostly
using it for mothma and her making ebo easier
to ’flip’.

How tough would it be to play against
a flipped hidden base objective with ebo up
and running?  It’s very possible here.

Thanks for the reviews
Maybe I can start reviewing now too
