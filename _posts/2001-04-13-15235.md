Strategy: '

ok u start go against bhbm. u start the other ones agasint other decks.... use the stew to get force to smack scrubs when they deploy to endor db. or u cna it can wait first turn so u can activat/drain with luke. so u do all this crazy stuff early and stuff. plop beru and lars to their farm and play beru stew to activate 4 force. lost in wilderness to screw them when they come after u. 


match ups.


against huntdown. u grab anything they play. then put down beru and lars activate and use stew on there turn. then beat them down early. then take time and make sure vader comes down for a little with it can wait..meen while eat that stew.


against bhbm. same thing really kicks them since u start goo so emp can’t come down.same as huntdown.


agaisnt scum..easy. smack em early. move luke over and invade the chambe.. u may want to it can wait scum a few times.


ties.. ouch. try to drain them... retrive...it can wait on sfs.


all do more later '
