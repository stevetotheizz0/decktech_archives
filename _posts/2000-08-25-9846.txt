Objective:
This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time/Pray I Dont Alter It Any Further

Strategy: 

If you are looking for a Very quick and powerful deck then this is it, if you get lucky you can get dark deal out on the second turn but most of the time its 3rd turn. That dosent give your opponent a whole lot of time because they are not going to like those dark deal bonus's. And when they come down you will have the troops and the trooper assaults to stop them and with There is no try out they will be paying either way. With the numerous effects in this deck you will be prepared for a lot of decks. This is basicly the way the deck should be played. Start with Cloud City: West Gallery and get out secret plans from the obj., and then use one of your twileks to get Bad feeling have i out so an early beat down crew will not happen. You will get the Bespin:cloud city location out on your first turn so you will be activating a lot of force including the 10 locations in this deck. You basicly control each site with about 3 to 4 troops becase of the added power bonus from 3 places the Bespin:cloud city location, dark deal, and the trooper assaults. You will have damaged them a lot early so the chance of recovery is slim and if they do manage to get there you will be ready. GOOD LUCK!
