Strategy: '

Usually start with Careful Planning and Obi's Hut and Cantina or Audience Chamber if playing against Court.  Use DoS with Reflection at Yoda's Hut.  Give her Anikins Saber and Lightsaber Pro to drain at the hut.  Use Electrobinoculars for On The Edge.  Dont worry bout losing mains to Mantellin Savrip cause there is plenty of Retreival to get them back. '
