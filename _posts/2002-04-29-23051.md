Strategy: '

This is profit ridden all over it. Take cards for drain and battling there and use out of commision to take them out. Its a good deck with few problems i see. no real power. destinys are there its huge but no power. 


SOme card choices

stun blaster-if u know how to track its a killer card. it sends them in to ur hand. decent destiny. u can u rebel artillery. u cant go wrong


3 jins- its a great card in this deck. deploys for 6-7 with alien protection.


free ride combo it kills occupation and makes me look at there hand for a turn...wow


yoda stew combo i have no idea. i have never used this card. 


ott combo kills mains if u do a direct assualt. kills hunt down too.





First turn podrace and deploy quin jin. 

second turn start draining and see what happens.


Against some decks


HUnt down it kills it. it will over retive and keep the wattos place secure dont worry. spread late game with few battles its a game


Droids its a deadly deck. becreful and go after them in ur own time. timeing is required.


Hoth go after them after a while. drain and stack with pod race will doom them


senate ties senate is no problem with this deck. stall in senate with drain in watto with pod race it will kill them.


Tell me whats wrong in english please. i appereicate any help. see u in vegas people '
