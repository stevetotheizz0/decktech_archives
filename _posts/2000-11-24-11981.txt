Strategy: 

Well here we go...

Its a pretty simple strategy. Lots af characters, lots of power. So you just group guys together and go for the power beatdown.

The Stormtrooper Cadet is pretty handy, kinda like a Talz.

Eriadu is nice because most of the characters are forfeit +2.

Oo-ta Go-ta Solo? is kool cuz it punishes good guys trying to move around.

Visage of the Emperor there to turn Luke. Use Janus Greejatus, Weapon of an Ungrateful Son, and Operational as Planned to setup to turn Luke.

You can use R2-Q2 to check you r destiny tracking.

This is my first real try at a BHBM deck. Thanks
