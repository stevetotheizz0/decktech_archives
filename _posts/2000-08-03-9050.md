Strategy: '

First Turn Grab DB Control Room and Drop Torent there if you got him, or use a tactical support to get him. Then Grab all the DB's in the deck. If you got them (in you hand or from the Tactical Support) drop a Trooper at each 1/0 Docking bay and move Torrent over to the D* DB. This should get you 15-20 activation second turn, but it depends on luck. You should have 15 force a turn by turn 4.

Just drop a high ability character anywhere and from then on just conrol w/ M'iiyoom, Screw, and Monnok. This should keep anything troublesome off the table. The Vader and Mara can take care of anyone that does get by the web.

Thanks for looking and please don't give me a low rating cause it's sombody else's idea. (TRM was soemone elses idea once, yet there are millions of versions posted)'
