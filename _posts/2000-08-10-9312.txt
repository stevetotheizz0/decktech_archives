Strategy: 

Strategy
This deck give major force loss to the light side. Here is the strategy, by card type.
Start with Imp decree, since you will be controlling a Rebel Base very soon. Your location
gives you a 3-0 start.
Locations:Hoth locations to drain at, clouds for super drains. Deploy Kiffex only if neccesary
AO: My AO gives Direct damage for each commander at a battleground site, thus the
commanders in the deck.
Characters: As said before, commanders for DD and AT-AT piloting. Veers on Blizzars 1,
OS in his ship, and the Tibbana guys on the ground.
Starships: Obsidians in the clouds, star destroyers and BH ships at the system.
Vehicles: AT-ATs at the site for drains, spread them out! AT-STs are support. Put the
cloud cars in the clouds or hold on to them and deploy as a react to a battle at a cloud
sector.
Effects: Too Cold For Speeders is anti-EBO tech, because most EBO will use some
speeders as a defense for Hoth. Imperial Decree should be up and running within 2-3
turns. Battle order requirements are easy to fufill. PotF is for even bigger drains.
Rebel Base Occupation for big direct damage. Cane Adiss is for the ever popular Jedi Decks in my area.
Interrupts: Walker Garrison; an awesome card. If you occupy 3 Hoth sites with ATATs
then your Force Drains are plus 2 at Hoth LOCATIONS for the rest of the turn. That
means with the miner on the ground, clouds in the air, the sabers and POTF, your drains
are four at EACH cloud sector, up to 7 at the defensive perimeter, 4 at the DB, 3 at the
ice plains, 3 at the North Ridge, 3 at the corridor,and 3 at the system, assuming you
control them all :) Thats not even counting the direct damage from RBO and the Admirals order. Total force loss: 44

Take that, EBO!
