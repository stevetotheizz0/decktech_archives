Strategy: 

Ok this is a SYCFA that will flip. You will generate huge amounts of force. So to get most of this, try to get Miiyoom ASAP. Then put their males to lostpile again and again. Monnocks will keep their hands small. If you get Miiyoom to starting hand you can "scan" their hand by your second turn. 
Ok Goo ney tay will cancel this, but it wont hurt this deck. And nobody starts with it. 

Important for winning is to keep their early drains at control. So you have two undercover spies and strategic reserves to do this. Draw gunner. Then put him in reserve, play him, then search for laser, draw again... = Cancel their best drain each turn. Imperial degree will help you in the late game.

Conquering space will be a must for victory, so you have plenty of good ships to do that. And the rate youll be deploying them and considering opponents pilot shortage, you should get space.

If falcon is what you fear, put Guri in space, also Ive lost R2 and Lateral damage will help.

If they try to raid your Moon, kick their arse with mains and make Tarkin shout; Put all sections on alert!

Flip when you are ready. Then drain them to dust.

Here is some matchups:

WYS: Conquer space and keep their cantina drains at minium. Then win.

EBO: Funny game. Go and blow Hoth. Not easy, so youll have to do some tracking. BUT ITS WORTH IT! Again take space...

QMC: Take Bespin = win.

MWYHL: Tough because JT 1. So dont bother to flip. Drain and battle. 

RTP: Get rid off bacta tank and kill her(many times). Dont let them take Death Star! Blow Yavin!

AITC: Try to win drain war. Miiyoom will help a lot! Start with battle order.

Profit: Put Xizor and Boba Fett to guard han. Send reinforcements ASAP. Miiyoom will help...
Flip and drain.

Mains: Drain them to pieces. Imperial degree and Miiyoom will do the job.

Thats all. Revieve this and tell me what went wrong(if any).
