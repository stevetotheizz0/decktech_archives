Strategy: '

I use Wedge RSL because we works with Luke,Red Leader in Red 1, Tycho, and Corran Horn. So I cancal destiny in space or ground fairly easy. 

Dos is in there because i currently dont have epp leia. and I feel a back up leia is always in order. 

Oola goes to the Home 1 DD. If I have the extra force shell be used. if not shes getting me a few extra force... Till Tatonnie comes out. 

When I first made this deck I didnt have any 8d8s or Madin so i used Tycho,and Colonel Cracken with each of there ships and Squad. Assignments to deply at the Yavin 4 docking bay if needed to get the princess. So the Space Kinda stayed in the deck, and added a few systems 

The It could be worse is to cancel force drains + I love this card )( I hate that cambo card Worse/box ( )

But even with is could be worse I hate force drains so i have 2 undercovers, and a landing claw to stop those force drains because i hate them. That way hoply i wont need to use it could be worse because of the combo

OOC/TT aginst Hunt downs that play ephontmon. I know my objetive places people out of play, but the combo might as well be used. 

I usely save the princess 3rd-5th turn. 

I try to take space. The han/falcon with dash/outrider can take a system. then whats left can take the other. But if im losing in space I have 2 ground spots to force drain for 2. 

At first I used houjix in the deck, but the i got a houjix/out of nowhere in a pack and i switch because of the destinys, but then realized that out of nowhere works great in the deck. 

Ben is ben he works good all over the place if i got him with his sabor with leia i’m happy, but if they put a docking bay down ben might go off and fight.
