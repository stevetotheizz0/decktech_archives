Greetings, thanks for looking through my deck. As I know, this deck is very strange. It looks a lot like &#8220;All Your Bases Belong To Europe&#8221;. However, I have made quite a few changes not only to fit my Meta, but I feel I have strengthened the deck quite a bit as well.

	Now first off you will notice the deck just not play an objective. Your starting site is usually the Tatooine system. However, when you play WYS (which happens about half the time in my area), you start Blockade Flagship Bridge. The starting effects are Imperial Arrest Order & Secret Plans, You Cannot Hide Forever & Mobilization Points and Combat Response.

	The thing you must understand about this deck is that it is soooooo good against the strongest light side decks out there, I know some of you are saying that you light side deck that isn&#8217;t below is very strong, and I don&#8217;t doubt that. However this deck murders the strong decks in my area. The following decks have a severe disadvantage when playing against my deck

-	WYS
-	QMC
These two decks are probably the two most popular decks in my area. Also, there is Lightsaber combat that is quite popular. But that doesn&#8217;t really matter, since this deck fairs good against almost all decks, but incredibly well against WYS & QMC.

What makes this deck so good? 
	This deck has a very strong space package. When taking on starfighters, you wont even get to the end of most battles as your interceptors can each fire twice. For instance, you opponent is playing WYS. And has red squadron 1 with wedge on it, Mirax in the pulsar skate, dash on the outrider. Which vs. most decks is quite the force to be recond with and would most of the time stay there for the entire game. But against my deck it is nothing. 
	I deploy down saw two interceptor each with a cannon on it. And say one of the sabers with matching pilots for backup. I initiate battle, pay 3 target outrider add 3 to x. draw a 2 lets say (which sucks) but that doesn&#8217;t matter. 3+2=5, outrider has maneuver 4, outrider is immediately lost. Then with the same interceptor I fire again, target red squad 1, same as before draw as low as a 2 and its still hit and lost. Then fire with my other interceptor at the pulsar skate and again its hit and lost. There you go it doesn&#8217;t even matter how many destinies they get or whatever cause they don&#8217;t make it to the end of the battle. They are dead by the end of the weapons segment. Kessel is clear and you have a smile on your face as you sit there for the rest of the game, and win.

	This also applies for taking over Bespin against QMC. Any QMC player will tell you, the key to winning with QMC is owning Bespin. But if you shoot down all there starfighters how are they going to own it. That&#8217;s right they wont. You win. 

Against almost any deck you will own, cause light side space is all starfighters. LS capital ships are no good and even if the opponent is using them you can still beat them. 

Basic Strategy for setting up Tatooine
*********************************************
deploy docking bays each turn to Tatooine. Get your big guys (siths) down to Tatooine, one at each site. Send down a few ties with a cannon or two down to Tatooine system. Then get out Fighters coming in either by drawing it or with Major Turr Phenir. Then get out Tatooine occupation. You drain for 2 at each Tatooine docking bay (=6)[+1 at each from fighters coming in]. 1 at Tatooine (6+1=7). 3 from occupation. (7+3=10) There you go 10-force loss for the opponent each turn. And its not even that hard to set up.

Now your probably sitting there at your computer thinking yah your space is awesome but one guy at each site? No way they will get slaughtered. But think again.
	Interrupts are what keeps the siths alive. Force Field &#8211; cancels the targeting of a sith. Imperial Barrier x2 &#8211; no attacking this turn. Tatooine System text &#8211; power is +1 for each ship there.  Projective telepathy &#8211; don&#8217;t have an additional 2 after your well calculated deployment, too bad now battle. Force lightning &#8211; electricute annoying characters. 
	So pretty much in any battle you can get out of it. If you have to battle your looking at a Sith who is either immune to attrition (palpy, sidious) or sith who chokes or swings his saber (vader), or you have to have a character of ability > 3 to or your ability = 0. (maul) All of which have considerable power plus you add usually about 3 to your power from the Tatooine system. 

This deck is great

Why Darth Maul and not maul w/ double saber?? &#8211; the having to have a character of ability > 3 is too priceless. Especially against WYS, not too mention the immunity to attrition <5.

Blizzard 4 is sweet for pulling the warrior from reserve deck and deploying him for free.

If playing WYS or QMC. Perform the space takeover as explained in detail above. Then once that is complete continue setting up Tatooine.

If playing any deck not space oriented. Play just as the Tatooine set-up strategy above indicates.

All in all, this deck has got what it takes to be a dominant force is today&#8217;s Meta. I would appreciate constructive reviews and any suggestions you might have regarding my deck. Feel free to d-mail me regarding questions or comments as well, I can explain card selections etc. 

May the Force Be With You
