Strategy: '

This deck is supposed to start the Podrace Arena...


At Ramapo I played Test One but for the Team Tourney I changed it for the 3rd A Step Backward. If you want change it back in. If you don’t want to test to one change the Training area to the Bog Clearing. Sorry about that.


And why the grabbers with no wise advice? Becuase I don’t mind paying for them and I normally save about 5-6 force a turn if I have a decently sized hand.

Charlie had been playing around with a hit and run mains deck that had podracing and superfalcon that started MWYHL. When we got to ramapo I didn’t have a LS decided upon but I did like the look of Charlie’s deck. After going from room to room I noticed that ground was the most popular, and HDADTJ jizz would be running rampant. I decided to take the platform of Charlie’s deck but remade it into a beatdown deck that is full of tech (Jedi Escape is TECH). I played against 3 huntdown jizz decks over the weekend and won each game by 20+.


This deck is solid and performed well for me at Ramapo losing only 3 games all weekend for me- to Charlie Herren, Dominic from Canada, and Ed the Michigan state runner-up. Also Adam Drake used a carbon copy of this deck and only lost 1 game with it over the weekend. Props to Alex Tennet.  


This deck is simple...beat down with mains...win the podrace...play defensively untill there is an opening. The space package is minimal becuase I didn’t expect a lot of space at Ramapo and besides the ISB space there really wasn’t a lot. The ships I play can disrupt people in space, they aren’t going to clear space for you. This deck is 1-0 against ISB space beating Mike Dalton by 15 during the DPC.


This is a very good deck, play smart, start DDTA against Mob Points or IAO/YCHF. 


This deck wins by a lot. At Ramapo I had atleast 3 games with dif of over 30 with it.    '
