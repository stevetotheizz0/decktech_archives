Strategy: 

This is the most powerful deck in r3 cards. The addition of the 10 defensive shield cards made dark side ties extremely powerful. Beggar and frozen assets have been eliminated kills all hope of a beat down by the light side space. No matter what kind of hand u draw its will be useful. Let me go through card choices.

Ozzel: Great in the senate and in space. Forfeit of 4; deploy of 0 and politics of 2

yep yep: this guy is a monster. His game text of make one card lost is like visage. This works great with this deck

baskol: great for lose of one at naboo system. 

passel argenta: let see that cheap x-wings beat down.  Wow

toonbuck: its good for attrition value. Probably u can sub for maul if needs it to be.

Tikkes:  great for activation and honor of the Jedi and taking force pile into hand. 

Orn free: taking up space but I needed more senators and deploy of 1 nothing wrong

Two spies: great for canceling a force drain

Motion supported: great for adding 2 to a drain in a system. Also great for using a card from a hand for more battle damage.

Imperial decree:  Greatest card in the game I think. One location and 2 systems thats all need it. Control senate and 2 systems and their force drain bonuses are canceled. (Not there force drains) 

Death squadron: retrieval of 3 and forfeit of 10. Great for wys because it can go down for 8 at kessel.

Bounty ships: Adds battle destines some varieties of the combos.

First couple of turns:

Grab waa., and activate. Drop a senator or few ties in the first turn to system. If any system on hand drop it. 

Second turn activate drain and deploy and look for sinear fleet and systems. Use senators to the full potential.

This is a real simple deck to play and win. Just deploy retrieval and use the senators.

Against decks:

Wys: This is an easy objective to beat. No more beggar and first strike (I forgot the light side version). Control corusant, tat, and senate at all times. Use defensive shields as offensive cards. Let them come to u. let them have cantina and drop a spy. Senate will take them out. Their game text is huge.

Dueling deck: This is the hardest one so far. Not because it is a great deck but its activation is great and force drains can get massive. But u will out drain them and retrieval them. Imperial decree is your friend. Do not deploy sps to generator or the next site. It will be lost during control phase. Least u will win by is 8 and most will be 19. Never lost to duel deck yet.

There is good in him: leave ozzel in the lost pile. set up imperial decree and come here u big coward. Its over. Lateral damage out rider or home and beat down time.

Hidden base: Set ur self up in the senate and u yep yep in till they think they are safe. Use secret plans to damage their retrieval. Do not deploy waulkein in till late game to retrieve with shield and sword. 

Profit: This is hard match up. U have to set up fast. Use the yep yep again and destroy there life force. Use arica and u3cpo. Use ozzel with ghkk to stop force drains. There force lose is not going to be that much. Average wins 10-22
Never lost to profit with this deck. Start with Arica in the room. This will make them think twice about rescue.

Hoth: use yep yep and other senators for there advantage. Its going to be a short of long game. Depends on there lost of sites.

Light side senate: This takes some skill. Power up at the corusant system. Drop shield and sword and few ties and u got power of 8 at the senate. Each ship adds 1 to corusant sites for power. Use Arica for forfeit. 

Generator is gone: do not know. Never seen it in action. 

This is a finest tie deck I made besides my Endor ops. It never lost yet in a tournament. It destroys decks and meta. Drain of 6 a turn and lost of 2 a turn kills them. Retrieval is huge and useful.

Some cards might hurt here some knowledge

Battle plan: It will hurt them more at the end. Imperial decree is a card. They will be drained faster and quicker. Make them use it. You can u the senator for a lost a Naboo and yep yep.

grimtash: It might get u it might not. U will never have more than 3 non-uniques in hand. Sword, shield and death squadron is great. Retrieval them just lost. Grab them if u see a lot of them.

Aim high: Its a pain in the a s s but it will barley hurt u. It does damage at the end for short range fighters.

Grabbers: Nothing to grab accepts advisors so dont worry. Just let them have it. 

location location: It will damage them at the end. Try to get to your systems as soon as possible.



Everyone has their opinion but this is a great deck with defensive shields. It will hamper opponents offensive cards. Be smart and try to damage them much as possible. Space is yours as long as u do not make a mistakes.
