For a spoiler, check the following site http//members.xoom.com/SWGold18/StarWarsCCG/Spoilers/DeathStarII.htm

This deck is a quick starter, usually getting Home One in play in the second turn. Use Balanced Attack to get Ackbar and play him at the War Room for 2. Also in turn 1, use Insurrection to get the docking bay and play one of your cheap 2 deploy pilots there. With these two, plus a system in play, you activate at least 6, which is all you need to deploy Home One. To get the ship, assuming you're not facing a Sanning Crew or numbers deck, discard Insights to get Launching The Assault and Home One from deck.

This deck is easily strong enough to take on any Imperial space deck, but in order for it to work at its best, you need to get Squadron Assignments quickly (use The Signal).

This deck can also hold its own against a DS ground deck. Try to set up big drains in space while using Luke, Leia, Lando, Han, etc. to combat them on the ground.'
