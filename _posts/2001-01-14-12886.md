Strategy: '

First of all...

In regard to some D-Mail’s that I have been rating my own deck. I have realized it was wrong and a bad thing to do. I guess i did it because i wanted some good ratings on my pretty poor decks. I am sorry about that and i hope you will accept my apology. Also i will not be using my SwarsPlayer name anynmore, Thanks.
(NOTE I HAVE NOT RATED THIS DECK)




Now for the very in-depth strategy of this deck

Actually this deck doesnt envolve too much startegy, but I’ll advise you what to do in the beginning of the game.

The opponent has will have no choice but to battle the solid based characters i this deck, otherwise Ominous Runors and other force drain enhancers will absoulutely knock him out.

You’ll want to start your game put with Endor the system and the starting interrupts listed at the top. The sole strategy of this deck is defend Endor. Don’t wander into other systems unless it is higly needed make the opponent come to you. With the 23 characters and 6 sites it allows multiple people to defend each site. The ships are meant to defend only Endor. That way you can deploy Ominous Rumors to increase force drains.


Now to look at each and every card... This will signify the importance of each card.


		     EFFECTS

BACTA TANK-ACCIDENT POST SORRY ABOUT THAT INSTEAD REPLACE THIS FOR A CHARACTER LIKE WUTA BUT FOR DARK SIDE
INCONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES-Because there are many
		       weapons in the deck. You
		       can forefit these for 3.
OMINOUS RUMORS-IMPORTANTdeploy on Endor to
	       increase force drains note do not
	       deploy until Endor palnet is well
	       defended
PRIDE OF EMPIRE-opponent could lose 1 force each
		turn (read cards text)
REACTOR TERMINAL-any cards you dont need at the
		 time can go to used pile.
MOBILIZATION POINTS-increases force drains
SOMETHING SPECIAL PLANNED-opponent must use
			  force to move starship
			  to move theirs to yours

		      INTERRUPTS

CONTROL-To insure they don’t cancel Ominous
	Rumors (don’t use for anything else)
LEVITATION ATTACK-search deck for device and add
		  that destiny number to your
		  character (device being
		  stormtrooper backpack)
IMPERIAL COMMAND-draw and admiral or general into
		 hand
YOU OVERESTIMATE...-Triples resulting battle
		    damage
IMPERIAL REINFORCEMTS-can take ties out of lost p.


		    CHARACTERS


NO NEED TO EXPLAIN EACH AND EVERYONE. THEY ARE ALL PRETTY POWERFUL AND SOME INCREASE DRAINS> I DONT HAVE WUTA BUT I RECOMMEND EXCHANGING HIM FOR ONE OF THE WEAKER CHARACTERS IN THIS DECK. THIS WAY YOU CAN TAKE SITES FROM YOUR HAND

		    LOCATIONS


NO NEED TO DESCRIBE EVERONE EXCEPT 2

Kessel-A Place to deploy the spaceport
Spaceport-after deployed move to Endor and deploy
	  With TurboLaser.


		      SHIPS

SHIPS-To defend just the Endor planet to keep
      Ominous Rumors in Play. Also pretty powerful


		  WEAPONS/DEVICES

Stormtrooper Backpack-To use with Weapon
		      Levitation
Laser Projector-Incase opponent has a lone person
		at a ainterior site.
Others-To increase the Characters and Ties forefit
       value and use weapon destiny




Thats it... Thank you for reading my deck feel free to rate my deck and again i am sorry about my rating thing. I ask that you do not criticize my score because of a thing that happened in my past, but i will happily accept siggestions. Now Go Rate


		   RESPONSE TO REVIEWS

I am giving this ranking for two reasons, Your starship selection sux. A tie Interceptor???? they are good, but you could have put in another defender. Weapon choice sucks, the charachter base is solid. kudos to you. Unfortunatly -1 star for Bacta Tank. Hello it is a lightside card. You cannot use it. Duh

otherwise it may do well if someone is dumb enough to attack you.


UMM. OK YES I MESSED UP ON THE BACTA TANK SHAME ON ME. UMM I DONT THINK MY STARSHIPS SUCK IN FACT I ASLO THINK THEY ARE SOLID. AND THEN YOU STATED THAT PEOPLE WOPULD BE DUMB IF THEY ATTACKED ME WELL IF THEY DIDNT ATTACK ME THEYD BE FORCE DRAINED TO DEATH WITH MY OMINOUUS RUMOR CARDS. SO THEY DONT REALLY HAVE A CHOICE. IF YOU WOULD HAVE READ THE WHOLE POST YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT


Mob. Points does not add to force drain. Weapon Levitation searches Used Pile, not reserve. Any HB and EBO deck will kill you. For added protection against HB add in a Sec. Procautions.


UMMM. MOBILAZATION POINTS ADDS TO FORCE DRAINS AT ALL DOCKING BAYS YOU CONTROL. AND THANKS FOR THE REST OF YOUR REVIEW. ILL BE UPDATING THIS DECK SOON FOR R2.	     '
