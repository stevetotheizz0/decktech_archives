Strategy: 

Me Jesse and OCF made this deck
it kicks ass
i get droids out then play numbers and that whoops your ass then i get a program trap out where you have some dudes and play counter assaults so when i cancel your drain i get mad destinies eventually you blow up.. say you have four guys at the site, a 5 has to be drawn. i cancel your drain.. i draw four... 7,7,6,5 bam we all die and you lose 7+7+6+5 that = 25 thats half the game.. ha! FUN
anyway otherwise i play space drain as much as i can.  blowing stuff up is fun too so beat that.
