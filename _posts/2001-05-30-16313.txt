********************
Response to reviews

Boba Fett 48 - Why?  Cause huntdown is perfect engine for dark jedi.  Also, direct damage from Visage is real good.

EvO - How are the crews ’worthless’?  I can still play them.  Extra visages are for direct damage and destiny draws.

Elvis - You make many good points.  3-4 senses would be a good addition.  If they play SAC protection or WYS, 8 senses are 8 too many, though.

********************

Sometime English words hard to find. So I give notes

Scanning Crew away objective.

Race, retrieve when Podrace win.

Duel but careful.

Use Janus to track destinys well.

If they start anti-scanning crew Visage them away. If they go for HOT Jedi, scan them away.

I am tired from talking so much English.

DMail me for more specific questions, thank you.

I play this deck against many my friend today and it win all time. I will take to next Guerrero Provincial.    '
