Black Sun RULES.  It lets you CONTROL the battlefield unlike any other.  Anyways, here’s how you play it


The objective of this deck is to capture the big guys and send them to the dungeon.  First turn, use IAO to get Coruscant Docking Bay out.  Move Xizor over and deploy some characters to back him up, if you can.  Next turn, deploy Tatooine Docking Bay, move Xizor and back him up.  You should start seeing sites pop up in your hand deploy them and start draining.  He will try to stop you... that’s when you start capturing him and dropping them in the dungeon, retrieving 2 force a time.  Use Audience Chamber to get out someone useful, and then Scum.  Retrieval battling, and lots of good characters.  Also, use VOTDP’s abilities to it’s full extent, by dropping a good destiny down, then tracking, check your destinies, then shoot in the right order.  It’s really effective.  '
