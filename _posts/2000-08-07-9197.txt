READ THE WHOLE THING BEFORE RATING OR REVIEWING THIS DECK


*********UPDATE**********
So some of your still think this deck will lose out in ground drain race? Well some of you don't think that I'll be able to get out my key effects to lessen my losses. There are always my Twi'lek advisors to pull em out.

What would adding ground help do? It helps my opponent, if they happen to be playing TRM then I'm sc*ewed and then they put the beat down on me. My single Mara with Vader and Tarkin to their Luke, Han, Leia, and Obi-Wan beatdown squad. Make sense?

'nough said
*****************************

Some cards explained:

Combat Response: Sabers and their pilots what could be better?

Imperial Arrest Order: grab E:DB and play Merrejk there for some major activation.

Mobilization Points: grab Wakeelmui so you can play your SFS and get early activation.

Baron Soontir Fel: The ripper with a TIE, Adds one destiny and 1 for each other ceptor in the battle.

Major Turr Phennir and DS-181-4: free TIEs for Dreaded, so what force drain were you talking about?

Commander Merrejk: Grabs you some systems if you need the activation.

Fighter Cover: Lots of people have overlooked this and you can pump your TIEs up some more if you throw their cannons on and run at them. Not to mention the ceptors can fire the cannons twice per battle for free.

TIE Interceptor: another note on Admiral's Orders don't use the TIE/ln cause I'll Take the Leader will bomb your toys.

Masterful Move: If your in trouble and you need to stop a big time loss, Masterful for Ghhhk.

Sienar Fleet Systems and Short-Ranged Fighters: Retrieval Engine at its finest. Losing Force from some drains. Play a TIE and get one back. Need some force late in the game, Short-Ranged Fighters for some major force back. Lose a TIE no problem, send it to your used pile.

Dreaded Imperial Starfleet: stops drains and gets your ships out easy. If they cancel they are stupid, free deployment plus it goes back to your used with Oppressive Enforcement.


Some deck strat:

Profit: Spread out and drain fast. They will lose some and you will lose some. But you retrieve. U-3P0 should stop one drain. They can't beat you in space so take your losses, just retrieve it, you outdrain them any day. Remember you can always stop some drains with Starfleet.

TRM: This will be one of the better matchups, they usually won't have much to come after you with. So when they send Wedge and/or Falcon up to greet you, smash it or barrier them. They probably will have to come after you cause most TRM decks don't have too many battlegrounds. If they got some drains going then drop Battle Order and they'll be hurtin.

Hidden: Hidden Base will be a slow game cause they will pull systems for you. Speed drain them, they may have bigger ships but you have the superior spacefleet. No contest you smash them all.

MWYHL: Spread out and drain fast, don't worry whatever you lose, you retrieve (Also remember there is always Starfleet). If they come after you, you will squash them in space.
