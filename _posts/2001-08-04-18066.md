Strategy: '

This deck is my Imperial Fleet deck that has a record of 30 wins - 2 loses. It is based on the DSII card that seemingly most new space decks are based arround that lets you pull matching pilots or ships and put them down.


A couple points of my deck that are important 



Of course, Combat Response


Accuser + Something Special Planned for them = You initiate a battle and put down Accuser for -3  as a ”react”, now the remains of their fleet has to use =2 Forc or be destroyed by the Fleet. The effect puts Death Star Plans decks basically useless and other cards that retrieve Force, like Nar Shadda Wind Chimes.


Mobilization Points = Pulls out Executor


Ord Mantell + Bossk, Boba Fett, or IG-88 = they deploy -2.


Vengeance + Obsiian 10, Black 3, or Black 4 = Forfeit +2 to the TIEs


DS-181-4 = Pulls out the rest of Saber Squadron, Saber 1, you pull out Baron...


Baron Soontir Fel = Come on, hes probably one of the best pilots out there, especially with his ship, adds one battle destiny and if with your Saber Squadron being pulled out with DS-181-4, the Baron adds 1 to total destiny.


Ozzel + Piett on the Executor = Executor is Power 17, and your captials delpoy -2 to same system.


Darth Vader + Vaders Custom TIE = Power of 6, Manuever 6.
