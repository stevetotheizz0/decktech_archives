Strategy: '

 Please don’t rate this on the cards but the thought behind it and strategy.

 First of all I use jedi pack han cuz he doesn’t cancel Bo Shuda, and u retrieve 10 instead of 5.

 2nd of all i use slave leia cuz i can retrieve an extra 5 force by freeing her with arc welder. Jedi pack leia is in for against court, u know, ephant mon protection


 here is what u do


 1st turn pull bo shuda that way u can leave your important ppl at audience chamber and not be battled 


 2nd If u don’t have a signal or seeking an audience in hand draw if u get that effect out u can get most of the important thing out fast like slave leia and tamtel. But the best part is the underworld contacts, deploy it with that 1st then your forcedrains are uncancellable


3rd get out tanus and tessek tanus adds 1 to forfeit and powerto your eloms, now p=5. and tessek adds to the drain get out artoo with hero and arc welder to free leia, then han. NEVER EVER free leia if u don’t have a nabrun in hand or someone who loves u cuz she cancells bo shuda till she leaves




Get your ppl out ASAP and beat the opponent down with nabruns and huge power



Force drains are no biggie against this deck, i cancel 1 with bargaining table and i always have 2 it could be wore in hand that cancells alot plus harc seff and his built in it could be worse also helps.


Well hope u have fun with thi deck, play it right and u will WIN WIN WIn. thi deck ahas lot but it has won FAAAAR moer than it has lost for me '
