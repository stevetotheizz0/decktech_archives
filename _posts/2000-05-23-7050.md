Strategy: '

This is a fun deck that I played at the team tournament at Ramapo. Not a great deck but went 2-1 both games were decided by kessel runs and lost in the wilderness. Numbers did some damage during the games but was not the primary reason for winning.

Setup you Biths at Clak'dor VII and insert. (Artoo, Wedge, or RF Capts are ok too)Deploy corvettes for free to RV point (with haven). Hit and run Epps to fight of resistance. Kessal runs get you back in the game and Tibrin for more #'s or kessel runs. Lost in the wilderness is great to play when mara or vader drain at exterior sites (Tibrin for that too).
