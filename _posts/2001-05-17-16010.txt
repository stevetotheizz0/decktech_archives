Strategy: '

Ok basicaly you want to get out guri and a presence of the force early 
to flip your card. once you’ve got it flipped force drain
for as much as you can with vigos. it should be too much too
early for them especially because they are losing 2 a turn 
from emporere and xizor. Use boba fett jodo cast and friends to
attack wherever they are. use force lightning with emporer and
use hidden weapons and all wrapped up to capture people and 
retreive with bounty. Make sure boba fett is escorting because you retrieve
plus 5 force. As you are beating them down force drain for 6-10 a turn
at cloud sity and you should win.

against MWYHL
get out bossk’s ship and load it up with characters and unload
on dagobah, slaughter luke and yoda and you chould win

against EBO
start with imperial decree and control 2 hoth sites
with boba and freinds to cancel their forcedrains

Against numbers
Start you cannot hide forever. If you do and you lose you should
kick your own ass.

against WYS
this is probaby your toughest matchup. If he come and fights you
make sure you can capture a couple of his characters and AND NEVER LEAVE
XIZOR WITHOUT GURI. If he tries to just strait out drain you you can 
probably win the drain race

most hidding decks just strait out drain them to death.
you can force drain for about 15 by the 5-7 turn so drain away.

if you have any CONSTRUCTIVE critisism I will be happy to hear it.
do not just say "oh your deck sucks" tell me what I should change and so on.

thank you for your time
