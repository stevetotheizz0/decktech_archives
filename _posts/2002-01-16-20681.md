	Aim High '

Strategy: '

"Another Jar Jar deck, but not straight Gungans?" you say?

	Well, I’ve not yet gotten a box of Theed. However, I probably will post one of those when I get one. Nyah.


	Upon first glance, this is obviously NOT a serious racing deck. It’s basically the same as always - Jar Jar/Munchen abuse. The Podrace is here to provide a simple and quick source of retrieval. If one does lose the race, however, A Close Race absorbs a lot of the damage and Aim High prevents opponent’s retrieval or actions that turn.

	The basics of the deck is to circulate your Binkses through Table, Munchen, No Love For The Empire. I find it best to use Munchen’s gametext to deploy Jar Jar AFTER you have one in hand. That way you can cancel a drain/destiny and still have Binks on table.

	Bargaining Table also helps cancel drains with you Gungan Warriors.

	There’s three Jeedai in the deck to wreak havoc with Hunt Down and/or Let Them Make The First Move. I recommend you deploy Luke after you’ve got I Must Be Allowed To Speak on Jabba’s Palace to give him full immunity on Tatooine and keep him at one of your battlegrounds to flip Their Fire Has Gone Out Of The Universe. Ben is your primary savior in this deck. Stick him with his saber, journal, and Yoda’s stick as well as someone to back him up, say Padme or Panaka - preferrably both. That way you’ve got a swing, a shot and power plus three, a weapon destiny cancelled, and a revival. Forfeit Padme for any damage/attrition and Ben’ll revive her.

	Qui-Gon is your Combat protection. Send him to an interior Theed location with his blade and prevent the Dark Jeedai’s battles and drains. Your Gungan’s can also be helpful on Naboo by deploying cheap against opponent and drawing a destiny with two alone.

	Daughter has her father’s lightsaber now. I still like the benefits from her rifle, but I’ve grown partial to the glowing blade of death once more. Arm her with that, Lightsaber Proficiency, and Reflection and you drain at plus two and retreive one at the same time. If Ben not on table for any reason, Yoda’s stick works just as well on Daughter to hold down the Marketplace for added retreival.

	Jar Jar’s Electropole is a recirculable seven destiny. This can help Lando when he’s blasting people. Scoundrel, his rifle, and Gambler’s Luck is a killer defensive tactic. When defending, Lando retreives one and adds it to his total power, which is already a six. Simply target a character and they’re power minus two. Lando also ADDS one battle destiny, period. Play Gambler’s Luck and you get two more, your choice out of three. This silvery-tongued loner has just cleared a site.
