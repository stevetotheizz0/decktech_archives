Strategy: '

 Start the Game off in the EBO setup position. When the Game Starts Use ANRB to take a system into hand if you did not start the game otherwise. If you did get a system use the effect to take up EBO and the War Room. You should get Luke, his Ship or a AWRI combo in your hand. If you don’t get a ship deploying effect you can draw for it or a Signal. Try and get him to the table on the first or second turn. This use  his text to get a ALWRI combo into hand to deploy backup. If you are comfortable with what you have then Use his alternate and retrieve a forece instead. It should take only a few turns to get three ships there.
 As soon as the rest of the sights are out start putting down systems. After you establish space then deploy Mon, if you can (Strike Planning or Sense Can help). Then use her to get out Rebel Techs.
 Then deploy and battle/drain. Here are a few cards that are in the deck and why.

Mon Mothma Her text at the war room and she will be easy get out. She subtacts one from opponents destinies and gets out Rebel Techs.

Rebel Techs Your opponent will be thrown off and think your an idiot. But practically they can go back to the deck when your done using them to occupy. 

All wing s Report In Combo Pullable with Luke, and if you don’t have GTYS or SA it acts similar letting you get ships. And it is the Smoke Screen of Systems.

Houjix combo Gets you out of a jam

Yoda Combo Recycle

Red 6 good destiny

Red 10 pilot adds a destiny to power

Pulsar Skate Mirax, with parts showing

Red Squadron 4 Cannons

Lando, Scoundrel Good for a super-falcon

Barrier and It can Wait Prevents a situation you would like to avoid letting them create.

Anyway, I know most of that was obvious to most of players but I wanted to tie it all together.
