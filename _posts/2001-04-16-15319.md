Strategy: 

the first few turns first use a force to pull a cloud city site. if there are not 2 lando’s in you’re reserve deck then draw all you’re force pil until you get him. if they are go ahead and deploy stuff. yuo want to get out lando to the casino asap. so you can start draining and playing sabacc. from there you want to get out the celebration asap. then it gets really fun because if you’re oponet tries to battle you you can play fall of the legend and into the ventilation shaft lefty to move them to weather vane and then to a cloud city site. if you get out i feel the conflict and orrimarko wins a battle against and imperial of ability > 2 the darks sid has to lose 3 force. thisc ombined with the massive force retrieval this deck shoudl ge ok.
