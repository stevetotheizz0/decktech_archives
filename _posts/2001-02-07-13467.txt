Strategy: '

Please note that I am a beginner and that I am mainly posting my deck to get advice on it. I usually try to free han and start draining. I save him ASAP so I can start draining at Tatooine and causeing my opponent to lose force every turn. Sabers and proficiency helps. For battling I use interrupts to add destiny draws (even though there are a lot of ways to avoide multiple destiny draws). In space I use x-wings to drain at Kessel unless the opponent has a rather large space force. I also hold down Tatooine so I can retrieve with Tatooine Celebration. My corvettes are for helping my x-wings and because they have high forfiet (which is useful on table and with Savirp if it does not get cancelled). The corvettes also help me use Combined Fleet Action which helps me out against certain decks. I also retrieve force with All Wings Report In. Why Branic? Because he penalizes my opponent for having a large hand (probably high power/forfiet) He also has a decent destiny number. A Gift is a really helpful cards against decks with lots of aliens. Why Orrimarko? He works good against Imperials and has good power/ability. Why Wedge? Because I needed a pilot of some kind just in case. I will replace him with Corran Horn if I get him. Why Cloud City Locations?
I need them if someting goes wrong and I never free Han. Then I can atleast drain somewhere. Also I need them so I can deploy my Liea here. Why Leebo? He is a Power 2 Armor 4 droid. I can use him with A gift.

I also will add the following cards when I get them
Liea w/ Blaster Rifle
Corran Horn
Chewbacca Protecter
Rug Hug
Maybe Rebel Fleet

Thank you for your time.  '
