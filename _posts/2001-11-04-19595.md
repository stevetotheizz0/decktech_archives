Tactic


I use the Podrace to retrive some Force and to play ’I did it’

Then I play normal Hidden Base. I use the Mains like Luke, Leia,

Chwei and Obi to battle with the battle destiny adder Rug hug,...

This works very good. And I think that Hidden Base is one of the 

best Decks in Star Wars. 


That’s all thanks for rating me '
