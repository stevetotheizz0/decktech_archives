Strategy: '

First off let me explain my starting effects. IAR for CC docking bay if they give you no battleground sites to flip with. also you can get exec docking bay for an escape or an extra 3 activation. MP for activation and the threat of an Exector at any moment. And OE for destiny +1 to all capitals, grabbers for free, and sense/alter protection. I did some test draws and 7 out of ten hands had a vader in it. since i start off with 4 force from just me i might be able to get Vader out first turn and reek havoc. then later i an drop backup. YPAWOM is to have some obi protection. charming to the last helps me mad kill leia. if tarkin dies then empire&#8217;s back. DANG MY OPPONENT RETRIEVED 14 FORCE watch them use 14 force for secret plans then watch them lose 7 to imbalance. Over the coarse of the game get out some big blues and some admirals to the systems and some beefy guys to the ground. an extra visage of the emperor in case they destroy it and i have to doploy it again. also a nice 7 destiny. only 1 vehicle in case they have interior sites only(also kill the cowards that use sandwhirls). Prophetess for a little retrieval on the side. some guys with guns capture and slay the opponent&#8217;s dudes. also lateral damage a home one for a crushing win. control from the beginning and you got the game.
