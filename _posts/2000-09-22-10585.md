Strategy: '

Setup 

Start with Bespin,Guest Quarters, and
generally Squat.Assign.,Wise Adv., Insurrection.

Beginn with pulling your activation sites -
West Gallery and North Corridor.
Do not deploy the Lower Corridor until midgame -
you dont want to give them more force than you
have to, besides this site is just for the drain.

Get ships up the system - deploy the Sector as
last location before the flip, that way imperials
deploy to Cloud City + 3 - provided you have a
H Nethme at one of the sites when you flip, which
in my opinion is a good idea.

Drain and retrieve until they come to you .
If they do, use your Order to Engage Tech and
selective battles to win this 

Matchups 

SYCFA 

- Manipulator  Drop characters asap, since he
  probably has few characters you can outdrain
  him. The tricky part is the setup  with a
  good hand you should get setup well, before
  Myoom Onith comes down.

  Play calm, focused - renember  The manipulator
  is designed to beat you, not your deck 

- Ties  Fortify your System. Use Major Haash
  and Alter against Lateral Damage and to alter
  Sienar to stop their retrieval.

  With Battle Plan out, he will usually try to
  occupy the DSDB to get by the drain cost.
  Get your beatdown crew down there to deal with
  Palpy, Vader and whatever he throws at you 

  Use the AO to lower their Power (Most Tie Decks
  only pack a few capitals) by two, or if they
  play with interceptors and Red Squadr.1 is not
  in play, by three.

  Dont leave ships alone at the sector, make
  him pay for his drains and drain and retrieve
  like hell 

- Big Blue  Same as above. Since your AO isnt
  as good in here, use it merely as a counter
  at the right time.
  Start with Insights to fetch Battle Plan or
  Menace in case of Chiraneau.

BHBM / Huntdown  Start with Insights,Squat.Ass.,
Insurrection instead of Wise Advice, if they
play Epic Duel with Huntdown.

Get Luke to the system, so that he is safe from
Vader, fetch Honor to deal with the DD.

Dont deploy Obi against Vader - he will just
get circled. Use him (and maybe Luke) as Suicide
Mains, particulary effective with Luke in BHBM.

With the latter, wait till they deploy Vader.
Get your main in a battle two sites away.
If he tries to jump on u with elis or Rise my
friend, It can wait the card and relocate Luke
or Obi with Path.

Huntdown without Duel is actually worse, since
you can expect to see lots of counters and
characters. Use OTE to the fullest , hope for
the best. Dont open yourself to a beatdown.

With all three decktypes, use your AO to kill
multiple destinies from E.Power and I Have you
now.

ISB  Start with Menace and get Blount to the
System to add to their deploy cost. Kill spies
with Beatdown, Sorry about the Mess and Under -
covers with It can wait. Reduce drains with
Harc Serff, drain, retrieve - win.

Court  Easy. Search and Destroy wont do jack
since you can occupy a battleground early as
turn 1. Use Battle Plan and Honor to make him
suffer. Againt Bountyhunters - Beatdowns +
Order to Engage stuff.

Beware All Wrapped Up 

Yavin 4 / Tattoine Occupation 

One of the most harded matchups.
The player who outlast the others direct damage /
retrieval should win.
Dont spread too thin. Make him suffer, if he does.

Drain and retrieve. If you go for the beatdown
beware You are beaten, Trample, Imperial Order.

Cloud - City based Decks 

CCT  Usually a Sabbac Manipulator.
A fast setup will help this - u have to ensure
to drain for more than he retrieves on both
of your turns - namely more than six.
If you feel good in control,activate all but
one force for battle destiny and kill his sabbac.

TDIGWATT  Start with Menace to kill the deal.
Dont let him have the system. With All Wrapped
up, look for bounty hunters, otherwise beware
the Trooper Beatdown. Use your barriers and other
stuff. Dont deploy to many sites or he can easily
flip / reflip you  You can convert his sites,
too, to forcechoke him early on 

Rops  Unless they play without Chicken-Walkers,
dont bother going there. Namely, because there
is no anti-react card like beezer or romas .
You can flip him back with Tala/Blount and backup
and menace kills overseeing it personally.

Let him come to you, use your Order to Engage
stuff, play smart and win 


Thanks for your time . I hope you like the deck 

Please read everything before reviewing.
If there are cards in / out the deck, you wonder about,
let me know, just dont rate it badly.

Pay in mind, that i havent played this game for some time,
so my skills may be a bit rusty.

If you rate, dont just say that its cool or sucks -
i really am interested in your thoughtful input
