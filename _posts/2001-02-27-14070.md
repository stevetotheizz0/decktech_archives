UPDATE

*I’M NOT EVEN SURE WHY I AM ENTERTAINING THESE CRITICISMS, BUT I DON’T USE MERREJK BECAUSE HE MAKES THE INSERTS USELESS  COME ON, POEPLE, USE YOUR BRAINS*


HISTORY

This is a deck originally built for the Phoenix Mega Tournament and kept pretty quiet until the first DPC.  I wanted a platform for TIEs with an accelerated start and a small unexpected insert package.  Amazingly after months of playtesting, this deck has changed very little from its original version.


STRATEGY

Get the Emp out at his Docking Bay and deploy Wakeelmui with MP.  Then take your time until you can deploy Vader and one of your systems.  Drop Sienar and some TIEs for system-control and drop Vader for some ground disruption.  As soon as Luke is nabbed, transit Vader to the Emp and start dueling and draining in the Throne Room (with POTF there).  Dont worry about losing that one Force each turn to your objective, since youll be retrieving it the next turn anyway.  Combined with your TIE drains, you should win in no time.


QUESTIONS


Why no battleground for Vader to go to?

The original deck included the CCDB for Vader to sit at until Luke arrived.  But I found in gameplay that I rarely used the site since most LS decks provide you with a docking bay to go to themselves.  And since I include two Presence of the Forces, I figured putting one at the DS2TR was good enough if I HAD to have a battleground.  So far its worked fine as it is.


What if your opponent deploys YISYW and never loses it?

Then you have four cards in your deck that you can lose to Force drains, and you are playing with a powerful BHBM TIE deck.  No big deal.  The inserts are a luxury, not a necessity.


Why not use Emperors Power?

The original deck included this card, but (like the CCDB) I rarely used it.  I found that putting a POTF at the Throne Room and draining with Vader while dueling Luke was much more helpful than the added battle destiny (which was usually <4 anyway due to the low-destiny starships).


What about Grimtaash?

Aside from the fact that few players use Grimtaash in their LS decks, the threat of this card only exists in the first few turns.  Once you start deploying your TIEs to one of your systems, the potency of Grimtaash is minimal.  And if your opponent does manage to get it off while youre holding a few TIEs, just take another turn and draw some more.  Then retrieve what you can and keep going.  Its not the end of the world.


Why Fighter Cover?

Even though this Admirals Order does help your SFS Cannon a litte, that is NOT why it is in the deck.  It is in the deck solely for defense against Ill Take The Leader.  So when you draw FC, save it until you are certain the opponent will NOT deploy ITTL, then deploy or lose it at will.


MATCHUPS


VS. WYS

Start Secret Plans instead of TINT/OE.  Deploy Emp to his TDB and back him up with Vader ASAP.  You may want to move them into the Cantina if you expect Raiders.  Take over Tatooine with your TIEs and use your retrieval to overcome his measly drains.  Since most WYS decks have no insert defense, you should do plenty of damage this way as well.  Blow away whatever ships he puts out (either with battle damage or the SFS Cannon) and you should be fine.


VS. Mains (Y4, Hidden Base, MWYHL, etc.)

The TIEs and their systems are your greatest commodity in this game.  Once you take over a few systems, your opponent will be hard pressed to outdo your drain/retrieval potential.  You may want to be a little more cautious with Vader (to avoid getting him killed) and deploy him only when you get a Barrier, saber, or Sniper in your hand.  In any event, once Luke gets snagged, go duel him and drain in space.  Usually an easy win.


VS. TIGIH

Deploy Emp to the EDB first turn.  Move Luke into the DS2DB next turn and give him to daddy ASAP.  DO NOT DUEL LUKE  Just drain and retrieve in this game, and most TIGIH decks wont be able to hang.


VS. Agents/Chadras

Start Secret Plans instead of TINT/OE.  Once again, your TIEs are your greatest commodity.  Deploy Vader cautiously (be wary of Chadra swarms and speeders) and keep him interior if necessary.  Since few Agents decks use insert defense, Tech Mor will likely be a powerful asset as well in this deck.  You should win every time.


VS. Hidden Base

This can be a tough game.  Use your TIEs wisely and probe as soon as possible (you usaully cant win this game if you dont probe his base).  Your SFS Cannon is a powerful card in this matchup, so get it out as soon as possible.  If the inserts go off, youll win, so watch for that opportunity.  Play smart and youll be ok.


VS. EBOX

Once again, a tough matchup.  Since few EBO decks have insert defense, you will likely do plenty of damage with the odds.  Dont put Vader on Hoth (for fear of Ice Storm) but use your POTF to back him up on the DS2 instead.  Fight conservatively in space and use Dreaded Starfleet to its fullest potential.  Once again, play smart and youll be ok.


VS. MWYHL

Start Secret Plans instead of TINT/OE.  Get your damage out quick, but watch out for a possible superfalcon.  You have to get your drains going before he flips or you could be in trouble.  Usually this matchup isnt too difficult, but it could have its quirks.


VS. Profit

You may want to put Vader in the Audience Chamber if you get him before Han gets rescued.  Otherwise just play as normal.  The TIE drains will be a constant Force loss in this game and will be your key to victory.


It may looks a little impotent on the ground, but I assure you this deck works.  Vader (with some interrupt support especially) CAN hold a site and your TIEs combined with his drains are usually unstoppable.  And if the BHBM/TIE engine werent enough, you have a small-yet-deadly insert package for mid/late-game that almost always catches the opponent off guard and helps you win games you would otherwise lose.


I appreciate your time and comments.
