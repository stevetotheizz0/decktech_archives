Thanks for the comments, folks!  A few responses:

-Bean:  Kessel instead of Kashyyyk because my fight against WYS is much easier if I can convert their Kessel.  Its not a guarantee, but it does help.  Otherwise, its simply a place my ships come in cheaper.  I dont need the drain bonus from Kashyyyk... I got drain bonuses in space coming out my arse already.  As far as Igar... I dunno, he just didnt make the final cut.  Perhaps yank Evax for him?

-Garion:  QMC is not that big a problem.  The only thing that makes QMC a problem is Celebration, and owning the system is kids play with this deck.  If for some freak reason its not, the Occupation combo is included as well.  Senate I could see being a tough fight, depending on the focus.  Most Senate decks I see are beats, depending on sabers and weapons to knock off everyones forfeit and ensure big battle damage.  That doesnt happen with this deck if you keep your guys inside the vehicles.  As far as more red... why?  Red doesnt win games.  Red cant drain.  Red cant battle.  Red cards support the rest and help you win, but they cant do it on their own.  I need characters and cards with ability to occupy and control locations before I need red.  For the past 6 years I have built primarily decks that were immune to Sense and Alter (because I started playing tourneys before Hoth was released) and its a habit that has stuck with me.  You dont have to worry about not having a card you need when you absolutely need it if it cant be canceled.  Thats just my philosophy.  Remember, this deck is not about beats.  If I was playing beatdown, I would need more red.  For this style of deck, what I have included is just right.  As for low destiny... in a deck with this much power, destiny really doesnt matter much.  If I whoop you 50-15 in a battle, whether I drew a 1 or a 6 really wont matter all that much... chances are youre going to suck up all your stuff there for battle damage anyways.  Power wins battles in this style of DS, not destiny.

-Shadow 13: First off, Black 2 (DS-61-2) is in the deck, so if I really want to use Vaders twice per battle text, I can.  Otherwise, I just use it once and it still rules.  As for Mind What You Have Learned... I dunno, Ive never really had a problem with it.  Sure, I get no bonuses.  Thats cool.  But there is a lot of retrieval hate in this deck, and it sets up pretty quickly with the force I get from Dagobah.  The 3 or 4 I have played have not been big deals.  I would surely enjoy a game against a good one. =)

-Hardpack: Yes, the deck is vulnerable to Power Pivot.  Do I mind?  Not really.  The most its ever cost me is a bunch of pilots to cover battle damage, and thats only if Im silly enough to leave a lone ImpStar where you have weapons.  X-Wing Cannon does jack against this deck unless you spring it on me when I already have one of my three starfighters out... and I almost never use them for anything but a one-turn beatdown in conjunction with an ImpStar.  The suggestion about Iggy in ship is a good one, Ill have to figure out what I should cut.  Id rather ditch Bossk than the Avenger.  Fewer combat vehicles?  Its something Ive long considered, but I still find that 7 is just the right number for me to hold the site I want (or need for Battle Order/Plan) and still be able to harass my opponent elsewhere.  In a worst-case scenario, I use them as forfeit fodder aboard my ImpStars.  BTW, I have never, EVER lost to true Hidden Base with this deck, not in this form or any previous versions dating back to Special Edition.  You have the ability to probe a lot of different systems in the same turn and still not risk getting beat on.  The most Ive ever had HB flipped on me was two or three turns.  After that its gone and the game reverts back to a space drain race (which I will win).

If youre looking for fast playing, high attrition beatdown, look elsewhere.  If youre more interested in a deck that is versatile, has staying power, and contains almost no weaknesses, then keep reading.  

For veterans of DeckTech, Ill boil this down for you:  this is a variant on Brian Hunters ISB that he posted in May of 2001.  Ive been playing Big Blue a long time, but I would be lying if I told you that I came up with the entire deck by myself.  In fact, Ive been using Endor Ops as my platform for Big Blue since DS2 was released.  When I saw Hunters ISB version, I tried it, didnt like it, but did incorporate some of what I considered his better ideas into this design.  

Why Endor Ops as opposed to ISB?  For starters, I like the having a battleground system and site on the table on turn 1.  I generate more force on my first turn than if I played ISB.  I can grab Ominous Rumors and use it to good effect.  If I need it, the Bunker can be used to keep Imperial Decree in effect, and my opponent cannot walk into it from the docking bay.  The LS GT on my docking bay will often force people to stay and fight rather than run.  Having Endor on the table will often get me an early drain going.  Suffice to say I just prefer Endor Ops.  The only thing I dont like about it is the amount of Force I give up, but like everything else, its a tradeoff.  Its worth the risk to me.

At its core, this deck is a drain machine.  Ominous Rumors + Chiraneau will give you massive amounts of space drain.  That doesnt mean that if someone caps your drains or manages to cancel your bonuses youre sunk, however.  Far from it.  You can play in any arena your opponent does, and will usually outlast him there as well.  Your AT-ATs and ImpStars will be immune to most attrition, and if your opponent does manage to crack your immunity hell get a random 2/2 Imperial numpty at best.  

The only site you really absolutely care about holding is the Endor docking bay.  Use at least one of your AT-ATs to anchor your forces there, and back it up with a cheap chicken walker when practical.  Use your other AT-ATs to harass your opponent wherever you see the opportunity; at his docking bays, for example.  Remember, your characters will all be in enclosed vehicles, so forget about Fallen Portal and getting cut up with sabers.  Simply concentrate on having people to soak up attrition when necessary and you can easily outlast your opponent. This last principle goes for your space fleet as well.  It is very difficult to get a beatdown against this deck if you play smart. 

Tatooine Maul is included to frustrate EBOX and HBX players, as well as annoying WYS decks (once you can account for all their ability 4+ guys).  Maul with saber is included purely for a one turn beatdown somewhere to get rid of potentially annoying and/or deadly characters.  Drop him down to pay a visit to Pucumir Thryss, for example.  Or lob him into the Bunker to keep Imp Decree running and up your drain at another system (via Ominous Rumors).  Virtual Vader is really in here because of his immunity text, but hes still a great character and finally a pilot worthy of inclusion in an Imperial space deck.  

Setting up in space is pretty simple.  Use Mob. Pts. to grab the Exec, Imperial Command to grab Piett, Piett to grab Merrejk, and Merrejk to grab your systems.  Dont put Fondor out unless you plan to put the Executor down that turn.  Grab Ominous Rumors as soon as youre ready and have the Force free to put it out.  If they want to cancel it, theyll have to bring their own Endor site.  

I wont do deck by deck matchups, simply because how you set-up is rarely affected by what your opponent is up to.  You simply want to get a toehold in space and start draining, then step back and assess the situation.  Against QMC and other indoor drainers, youve got 2 UC spies to slow down the damage while you multiply yours upstairs.  If theyre draining you outdoors, bring the machinery.  LSC can be a tough match, but Ive yet to see an LSC deck that can hold a candle to me in space.  So simply get up in the air and drain for all youre worth, while holding your docking bay (Endor) and theirs (Naboo).  Keep from using the GT of Ultimatum for a few turns and you should be golden.   WYS can also be a tough matchup unless the cards come up in the right order.  Remember that Trample targets ability, not defense value (silly Talon Karrde) and you should be able to get in a good beatdown at least once or twice.  Cards like Battle Deployment, Guri, and Imperial Command are your big saviors versus WYS.

Comments always welcome, questions will be responded to.  Thanks for reading!
