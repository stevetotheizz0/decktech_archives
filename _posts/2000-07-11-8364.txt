Strategy: 

The plan of this deck is to get Leia and Yoda out and start training Leia, while Luke, Han, Lando, and Obi-Wan are out force draining and battling the oppenent Characters. I use the Crash Site Memorial and the Bacta Tank to save the hit characters, and their weapons, and the Redemption Lets The Bacta Tank characters deploy there for free. Use the effects of the Jedi Tests to help you out all over the place. Try and set up your destiny for the final jedi test, so you can have one awesome destiny again and again!Use all the destiny adders, such as I know to give you so many destinies that the dark side player will cry.lol.I also put sal torr kal fas on yoda and give him a lightsaber, it works really great! With Lightsaber proficiency on him, he is power 5 in battles, defense value 7, and gets a free swing, not to mention he is immune to attrition! It all works out pretty good for me.
