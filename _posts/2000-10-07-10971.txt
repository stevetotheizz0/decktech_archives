Strategy: 

Take out a Dreadnaught for the Chimera

Ok, so it ain’t the most original deck in the world......but not many decks on here are.....everyone makes a deck similar in some fashion.

The main goal of the deck is to set-up on Ralltiir and ignore your opponent.  Treat Ralltiir as an Operative planet.  You flip, opponents drains are -1, then you set up Imp. Decree, modifiers are cancelled, then Overseeing it Personally + lightsabers increase your drains and you’re set.  S&D, CHYBC!, and Battle Order will help you seal the victory.

Why no Tempest Scout 6?
