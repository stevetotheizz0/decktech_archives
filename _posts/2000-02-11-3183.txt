Strategy: '

Start Death Star and whatever interrupt is necesary (secret plans vs profit, bad feeling vs. mwyhl, crush the rebellion vs. obis hut or yavin 4, sec precautions vs. all others). Then go beat they ass whereever they are and never give em force. They wont be able to do much with such crappy activation they will have and all your guys will stay on the table from battles. Oh yeah get reactor terminal out fast too. '
