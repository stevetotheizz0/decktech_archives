Strategy: '

Basically get myoom onith out fast and use her to kill off all unigue Males. Then use Monnok to kill of doubles. YOu have good SAC in this deck so don’t worry.  Use your Big charactors to beatdown whoever they manage to get out. Then spread out and force drain to finish them off. It is an easy deck to set up and wins alot. Your effects to start out with are up to you, I ussually go with Imperial Arrest Order, CHYBC, and Mobization Points. Have fun with this one. '
