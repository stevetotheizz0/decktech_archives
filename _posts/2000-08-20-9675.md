Strategy: '

First of i would just like to say that huntdown is not dead despite honor giving it a blo To the face.Im telling you that huntdown with dueling ruled the tournament i go to because nobody expects it so they take out there anti dueling cards.

This is the first huntdown deck i'v made and i think it's pretty good basicaly get out the docking bays deploy vader at one mara at one and emporer at the other so you activat tons of force Get sim aloo and janus out so you can be sure that you wont lose before you duel. '
