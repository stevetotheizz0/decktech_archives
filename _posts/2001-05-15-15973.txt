Strategy:
(Stormtrooper Deck)
	Start out with Entire Legion, Battle Order, and Combat Response. Legion is a protector for stormtroopers 
and it gives 3 cards of destiny 5 now (my blasters). Battle order lets me use 1 force for more important things other 
than battling. Response is used for my sabers.
	Get Endor Shield out on the first turn before activating so you get deploy -1 imperials (all your characters!).
Also, don’t forget to get ominous and establish on your control phases. When you get you elite stormtrooperts, bring
them together and get them weapons with blast points. Remember trooper assault works best in groups. Major Hewex
gives a +6 power bonus when with all of your troopers. Use holonet to get out your imperials you need the most after
you activate and use a bunch of force.
	Pair up vehicle combos and put some at forest clearing for a +1 power. Spread and drain using location bonuses
and your lightsaber to help. Put down your two flipping effects as soon as you can. Force drain for 5 at endor! Use perimeter
patrol to make opponent stay away.

	Specific Card Strategy:
DS-181-4: get out a saber to help after deploying
Sim Aloo: good power and ability, immune to attrition <4, and can eliminate opponent’s good destiny
Colonel Dyer: ominous rumors protector and let you give battle help w/ stormtroopers
Major Hewex: power bonus from troopers, anti-bunker blow-up, and protection text
Grand Moff Tarkin: good destiny destroyer
Navy Trooper Fenson: most light deck use on edge for retrieval engine and protects endor

Replace with () stuff for the biker scout version.
