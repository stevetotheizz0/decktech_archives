Strategy: '

Okay, this deck is what LSC was meant to be...simply combat with other jedi. Get out all the sith to the 3 sites and drain away to make them come to you. when they do, finger of death any scrubs and combat any jedi...your almost guaranteed to win with the high destiny. now this is of course in a best-case scenario, but if the shield DOES come out, its just a set-back, not a death mark. i can still drain, tho not for as much, and i can go out and battle opponent elsewhere, with my high destiny it’ll be a massacre. and before you jump all over me for putting in the intruder missles and the double laser cannon, they are there solely for their 7 destiny as combat cards. there are no other useful 7-destiny cards i could find (that i own) so i added them. vader’s obsession is also extremely fun, as i can use combat cards since it is a duel. I also realize that there are not many backup characters, but this deck was meant to focus on the sith in all their glory. and while this deck was MAINLY built for fun, i do intend to take it to a tourney, so please give me any suggestions you think would make it better, but still continue in the purpose i had for making this deck. thanks '
