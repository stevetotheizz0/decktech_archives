***UPDATE***

This deck went 2-1 yesterday and helped me win the tourney (go read my report). It only lost to Kim Caton’s ISB/Walkers by 5, and I could’ve played a lot better that game. I don’t know why everyone thinks this deck will die in today’s environment. After Ref3, of course it will. But for now it’s a beast.

***END***


***UPDATE #2***

Yes, Code Clearance will hamper this deck’s retrieval. But guess what? I can win without Harvests. If my opponent is playing DTHACC? I just set up Celebration to retrieve. Granted the game will be a lot closer, but I’ll still come out on top. Anyhoo, if you REALLY think Harvests are too risky, I came up with this

Pull the Harvest stuff (6 cards)

Throw in EPP Han, another Celebration, Effective Repairs, Jedi’s Resilience, R-3PO (this guy is amazing), and another C&TV. I might, however, pull R-3PO and the 3rd C&TV for Nekkid threepio and We’re Doomed. I used to play We’re Doomed, and that card is great. Though I doubt I’ll go under 15 cards -)

***END LONG-@SS UPDATE***


***Update #3***

This weekend I’ll be playing my updated version in the post-R3 environment. If all goes well, I’ll post the updates. And yea, Drew, I’m pretty sure I was on your team (Team Tech or something?)

***End Update***


Responses to Reviews 
To Jackson Five You’re right, but I like winning with a whole lot of dif. Plus Harvests are huge, getting ANY 4 cards back, and 1 into my hand the next turn (with Mirax) is usually game-breaking (although I’m usually winning anyway -P)


To Mr. Monnock I like my character selection as it is, but an EPP Han and another Mirax or a Naked Threepio wouldn’t hurt. I thought about your theory today, and tested it in two games. I don’t seem to have any trouble finding some people to drop and clear a site, either with a Luke or 2-4 smugglers. I dunno, maybe it’s just my playstyle.


I’ve been playing this objective since my first tourney after Ref2 came out, and I fell in love with the it. Since then, it has been modified to fit Harvests, some racing stuff, and a few tech cards.


Some card choices


Harvests Retrieving any 4 cards is great. Grabbers, especially Code Clearance, will hurt this part of the deck, but read why I chose to throw an Edge in here. Also, its fun to have them kill Owen & Beru, then next turn drop the other O & B, EPP Luke, battle and play Harvest to add some destiny. Once you set up a nice cycle with Mirax, you win with insane dif.


Edge If they have TINT/OE out, play the Edge before you get the Harvest cycle going, and maybe they’ll waste their grabber on it. Also good for getting rid of the ROC combo.


ASB + Too Close This deck has never lost a podrace, the destiny is pretty high and the two interrupts are enough to win the race. If you do lose, however, they usually don’t save force for Aim High so they won’t be retrieving much.


Melas x2 Tat Maul can be a pain, so if they see you lose one early, surprise them with another.


Mirax She is a god. With her, you can Harvest every turn (unless they grab it or you need to pay for Plans). Just Play Harvest, retrieve another Harvest, track it, and use Mirax to get it back.


It Can Wait This card is huge. Play it the first time to stop Vader in a Huntdown deck, or a different key character, then play it again next turn out of your lost pile.


Lost In The Wilderness This card is great also. Get rid of Vader in a Huntdown, Xizor in AOBS, Maul, Palpy, or any lone main holding a site. And with the destiny of this deck, you’re almost garaunteed to make someone go missing.


Strikeforce Now that drain of 3 at Kessel is safe from senators cancelling it.


Only 1 LMF? I found that I rarely ever top-deck it (and I never have in tourney play) and if I do, I have some options. Drop O&B for 9, play a Harvest for two, and get it back, or use OTE or Celebration to get it back. Trust me, 1 is enough.


Some cards I had in here, but they didn’t make the final cut

X-Wing Laser

EPP Han

Another Celebration

Another Lost In The Wilderness

R-3PO (this guy is awesome)

Jedi’s Resilience


Matchups 
ISB If they stick 5D6 at an exterior site, drain for 0, cancel it with Lost In The Wilderness, and make the annoying droid go hungry. Otherwise, Mess him. Once you get rid of him, your constant retrieval will be enough.


Hunt Down If they are racing, you’ll probably win. Get out HotJedi fast so they have to lose to Visage while you laugh at them. Lost In The Wilderness is huge.


Senate Again, LostITW is huge, there goes Maul. BP&DTF will stop their drains, and Strikforce means your Kessel drain is safe.


AOBS Make Xizor missing, or go kill him. If they are racing, you’ll win the race. Should be a pretty easy matchup.


Brangus Drain for three at their D*. Win the race. Drain for a bunch, retrieve a bunch. Win. It’s that easy. Edge the ROC combo away.


Watto Get HotJedi and start losing 2 each turn so their cards go back and you don’t lose any. After they get around Honor, it’s usually smart to lose 2 anyway.


Well, that’s all I can think of. Try it and you’ll like it. If you don’t like it, you suck. If you have any questions, D-Mail me. If you don’t get something, d-mail me before you review.

Oh yeah, if you’re good and you’re in Coruscant, check my group page, Team I Bent My Wookie, and join it.         '
