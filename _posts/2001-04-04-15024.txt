Strategy: '

This deck is being posted here primarily so I can reconstruct it later.A few points

Yes, I train Luke. Training Luke is cooler than training Leia and more effective. It really only bites you in the butt against a BHBM deck. Against Hunt Down, Honor, OOC/TT and Obi do their work. And Leia w/ Blaster is just far too instrumental a part of the SuperFalcon to have her sitting on Dagobah.

Traffic Control does not make me a scrub. Destiny 7 cards fail to recycle themselves.

R3P0, Melas, Squassin, Advantage and Nabrun Leids are, indeed, good cards in this deck. They have all been useful in winning games.

Yes, the deck is undefeated in tournament play.

The match-ups

Vs Scum &#8211; Ages have passed since I last lost to Scum. This deck makes Scum drains too slow and punishes them in battle.

Vs Ties &#8211; Battle Plan will make Tie drains expensive. Take over the ground. Send the SuperFalcon up to space with Test 3 completed, I&#8217;ll Take the Leader in play and A Few Maneuvers in your hand. Use retrieval and Aim High to win. Refuse to fight their Ties as long as you can. It is possible that you can win with nothing more than ground control and Test 6.

Vs ISB &#8211; Six words Battle Plan, Test 1, Test 5. Those are the six magic words against most decks, but against ISB they are particularily effective. Without drain bonuses and the threat of Imperial Command, ISB turns out to be a lame duck. The &#8211;1 to your drains doesn&#8217;t hurt much because R3P0, Advantage, Legendary and Test 6 will tear ISB apart.

Vs Endor Ops &#8211; Why am I including this deck? Ignore it through Test 5. Flip. Bang. They die.

Vs Hunt Down &#8211; Tough match-up. Start Insight. Visage damage hurts. Visage is about all that hurts, but it gets mean. If you can cancel Visage without it getting replaced, you should win easily. But any good Hunt Down has mega Visage protection. Avoid dueling until you have completed Test 3 and have Courage and tracked or permanent high destiny.

Vs BHBM &#8211; The toughest match-up. Start Insight. Your deck relies upon the several turns it will take your opponent to get Vader to a battlegroudn and find a No Escape to beat Honor. Just keep damage to a minimum until you flip, then complete Test 6, win duels with Luke and annihilate your opponent through a minimum of 14 attrition in each battle.

Vs Random decks &#8211; Sabaac can hurt early. Just try to keep all early force loss from your hand. Always deploy the Training Area first to get as much of the Jedi Training stuff out of the reserve as quickly as possible. Against any random deck, play conservatively, ignore whatever damage you can recover with On the Edges, and force your opponent to come to you, to step into your domain.

Like it or lump it, this deck is good.
