Strategy: 

NOTE: The Dune Walker in this deck is supposed to be a Blizzard Walker. Also, please read the title of the deck. It was built for the pre-EJP environment, but I'm sure it could do well in post-EJP with some adjustments.

This deck is a revision of DS ForceChoke v2.0. It covers holes the deck previously had. Thanks goes to Techmaster and others for showing me exactly how much of an idiot I was.. :)
Start with the DeathStar and a necessary effect. If in doubt, start Imperial Arrest Order (or Oppressive Enforcement if SAC is a possibility).

Vs. Ops:
Start Battle Order. Get out Empire's New Order and Bright Center. Apply with walkers and Vaders. Draw for Beacons and use them t keep Landing Claw away. Be sure to kill Yoxgit.

Vs. HB start:
Start Imperial Arrest Order. If it's XWings, get your catch cards and Security Precautions. Set up a drain on the ground while probing/fighting in space.

Vs. MWYHL start:
Start Imperial Arrest Order. Get out Come Here You Big Coward ASAP. Own what battlegrounds they deploy.

Vs. other mains starts:
Start Oppressive Enforcement. If it turns out to be Revo, Twi'lek for Crush The Rebellion as soon as you can. Catch Barriers if they're playing 'em.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Message me any questions you may have.
