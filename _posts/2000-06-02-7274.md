Strategy: '

This is a basic Profit we all know and love.  I feel that I have it refined to beat any deck that is out there.  It has won many, many games for me and it is very fun to play.  The teacher has opened my eyes to using Leia Blaster, that gun is awesome.

To beat Ralltiir the location choices will win you the game every time.  It is not hard to flip it and get Ben on Ralltiir with the Locations chosen in this deck.  Order To Engage and Narrow Escape wins it a lot for me, and the Very small SAC package is something your opponent will not expect.

EVERY GAME start with Wise Advice.  You should win every SAC WAR just because you start with that and you have two Grabbers.  That way your Interrupts will go through.  The beat down in this deck is huge.

Against Numbers you can see I have 2 Dont forget the droids.

Vs Huntdown you can see I have a lot of stuff to beat that, I played this deck against Hunt down a lot and it dominates it.

vs Endor OPs....I beat this every time, mainly because Leia gets to the bunker on turn and beats on the next, some times on the same turn, it gets pretty brutal.

vs CCT....I have two grabbers...some SAC, so Sabacc is not going to happen.

I will not get choked in any game my location come out and my deploy is good.  I have 2 SPYS because they are so huge in so many different situations, not to mention the one Undercover comes in handy.  If you have any question about this deck or why I play with a certain card just ask.

Like I said before this is a proven winner, and it also happens to be fun to play.

Enjoy,
Tim '
