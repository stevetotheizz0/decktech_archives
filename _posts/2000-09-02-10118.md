Strategy: '

Your basic profit deck, except i use alien han and keep him at the audience chamber so he can't be battled or die.  and you force drain with eloms with tessek, cancel drains with bargaining table, and give profit damage with mains.  If they stay at the audience chamber and won't move put out order to engage and they'll move fast.  keep han at the ac and everything will work out fine.'
