Strategy: '

Well the plan is to start with Imperial arrest order to get out the guaranted battle ground. Once you got that set yup you should have a masterful move in hand to get the holotable. Set up a drain at the holotable and get vader out asap to flip. if opponent comes after you duel with vader or mara as necessary. If they dont come after you spread to drain and set up search and destroy.
Sorry for the lack of strategy but it is only a hunt down deck. If you are good at tracking destiny you should be able to win 95% of your games with this deck. At least i hope so )

Cheers.
