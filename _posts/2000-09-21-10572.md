Strategy: '

strategy is cool...so you sit at the upper 1/0 site and throw down some monkeys...then you spread out in one turn once you get all your guys out and then drain the sh1t out of them...they’ll never expect it.

claws are for decree/battle order
signal first for insurrection
initiate 5 battles/turn and you’ll come out on top after they spread out to stop your super drain INDOORS  heh
