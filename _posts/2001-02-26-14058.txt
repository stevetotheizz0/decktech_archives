Strategy: '

*****UPDATE*****
I took out Wyron Serper and added Honor of the Jedi.  This is a more effective way of dealing with Visage.
*****UPDATE*****

Start
Mind What You Have Learned
Dagobah
Heading for the med
Insurrection
Stating Area
Your Insight serves you well
Ounee Ta (Only for Ral Ops, court, and scum)

Turn 1 Deploy Yoda’s Hut, Yoda to the hut, and Hoth Echo Docking Bay

Turn 2 Deploy Tatooine Docking Bay, and scrubs to the hoth docking bay to start activation

Turn 3 Deploy Spaceport Docking Bay to Tatooine (unless playing against Ral Ops.  Deploy the Spaceport Docking Bay to Ral.)

Turn 4 Deploy Endor Landing Platform (Docking Bay)

AVERAGE Destiny Draw 3.3 (After Turn 4)

Key Notes

Battle and drain.

Use I’ve got a bad feeling to increase the damage.

Use destiny adders

I Hope She’s alright is for the crappy tie/space decks.

Frozen assets stops major build up by the opponent.

Ounee Ta turns None Shall Pass into unique and lost.

Deploy Spaceport docking Bay in between Tatooine Desert Heart and Jabba’s palace.  This will allow you to move from tatooine docking bay without getting stuck in the desert.

R-3PO, Corran Horn, and Lt. Blount stop spies and ISB.  They are there so you can force the opponent into losing force for spies at same location, breaking cover, and fliping ISB.

Free ride is a used 5 that allows me to look at one card in my opponent’s hand.  If that card is an AT-ST, Speeder Bike, or skiff, I can steal it into my hand.

Run Luke, Run is protection from Vader’s Obsession.  I figured that any good Hunt Down deck will have the destinies tracked so they can win any duel.  Keep Obi-Wan away from Vader.  Use RL,R to cancel VO.  I don’t think there are many darkside hunt down decks that have more than 2 VO.

Yoda subtracts 2 from attrition (The reason I use MWYHL instead of Hidden Base for mains)

Scramble and OTE is tech.  Scramble hurts pilots and OTE adds to the force loss unless the opponent initates battle.

Lots of cards that add to battle destiny.

Choke is tech for Ephant and alien decks.  This card allows you to cancel gametext.  It’s also a built in houjix.  Forfiet a (unique) alien to cancel attrition against you if it is to high for your liking.

Use a lightsaber and Sorry about the mess to take care of Guri.  She can hurt your destiny adders.

Why no Space?  Well, they just took up to much space in the deck.  I would add 4 starships and 1 character to add space. Libety, Home One, Tantive IV, Outrider, and Dash.  This would be too much space taken up.  There are a lot of darkside space on the rise.  I would get beatdown by Endor Ops and Ties if I went to space.  Stay on the ground.  Use cards like I Hope She’s Alright and Frozen Assets to deal with space.

I only have 1 OOC & TT.  Spies and Choke will take care of Visage.

There are 10 cards that add battle destiny in this deck.  Combine that with I’ve got a bad feeling about this to add pain and suffering to the opponent. 

2 Fallen Portals were cards 61 and 62.  I went for recycle used 5’s instead of used 4’s that had to play only during a specific time.

If the opponent isn’t playing numbers, lose Your Insight Serves you well to get I Hope She’s alright if it isn’t out and you need to put a hurting on the opponent.  '
