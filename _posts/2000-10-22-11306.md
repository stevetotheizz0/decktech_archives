Strategy: '

Get set up in space first with Gold 1 and at least one of the Tala ships. Then draw for Tatooine sites to put people at for celebration. Once celebaration is up get out Close Air Support and hold the system with whatever ships you have. Ideally, the Super Mon and a Tala are at Tatooine, and G1 is wreacking havok if your opponent is in space. From here, set up Ground drains and use Help Me Obi-Wan Kenobi to get people into battles. Vader/Tarkin just battle Orrimaarko? No Problem. Let’s "Help Me" General Solo into that battle. Next, I think Luke wants to "Run" to their aide. What do you know, I have a "Jedi Presence" now, and I’ll add a destiny with Solo being a general. Look Solo is with a scoutl, no destiny for you. Plus, Close Air support lets me draw a power destiny, plus add another battle destiny because of Tala 1 being at Tatooine.
Just do tech like that and you’ll do fine. (Granted that example was the best one, but HMOK gets whatever kind of character I need (be them general for leadership, scout for close air, or jedi for presence) so spreading out to drain and retrieve is not a problem). Also, by utilizing The Menace Fades and Battle Plan this deck seriously hurt a "All-one-arena" (ground or space) opponent.
This is a solid deck that is surprising and fun. Try it '
