Strategy: 

*** Take out a Twilek for a Iggy w/ gun***

Strategy:
Basically just shoot em up.  Fun deck, I think it could win too.

Card explanations:

Fett’s gun: This is for Jodo. Drop Jodo with this toy down at Moisture farm. First shot is +3 and free. After
that its +1 for 1 force.

MKOS: Better activation plus gives me immediate Grimtaash protection w/ Well Guarded.

Expand: Drop it on Lars and another 2 sites are weapon destiny +1 and drain +1.

Imp Artillery: its a 7, and if a weapon’s at a site they lose a force.

Shut Him Up..: Destiny 6, cancels Bacta Tank.

Oh Switch Off: Destiny 6, Protects my droids.

1st turn: Use Mob Points to pull Kuat, and pull a DB w/ IAO. Deploy Audience Chamer w/ the palace.

2nd turn: Deploy a DB w/ IAO, deploy to Kuat if possible. If not deploy from reserve with Audience
Chamber.

After that just go after them.  Getting the advantage with Crossfire is extremely easy.
