Strategy: '

Here is another attempt at a strategy section.


The object of this deck is to set up the JP/Galid drains and watch your opponents force hit the lost pile is rapid fashion.


First off, use Jabba’s Palace to pull all of your JP sites and deploy Maul to the landing site ASAP.  There are 4 Mauls in the deck so you should be able to deploy him rather quickly.  Also on your first turn pull the Audience Chamber and deploy a character there that can draw destiny and move Maul over to Jabba’s Palace.  Second turn pull a site, use the AC’s game text to pull Galid, protect him with another character and start draining.


After that, the deck is pretty straight forward. Battle the LS on the ground and eliminate their characters by using You Are Beaten, Sniper/Dark Strike and Force Lightning.  This deck has a decent space package, you should be able to get a Chimaera (since there are 2 of them in the deck) and Thrawn out relatively soon if you need to battle them in space.



Reasons for some of the card choices


Kessel  To convert the LS’s Kessel if they are playing WYS.  DS Kessel makes their drains 2, instead of 3 and your ships deploy -1 there.  Also if there are playing some kind of cheese deck, they are most likely playing Battle Plan, so you can satisfy it.


JP Dungeon and JP Droid Workshop  For added force generation and you can pull them out of your Reserve deck.


2 Chimaeras and 2 Imeperial Commands  If LS is playing space, you can establish a presence relatively quickly.
