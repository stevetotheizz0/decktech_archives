Strategy: '

Start with scum. get out jabba and chall to cut down on deployment costs. taym makes the raiders powerful so bring him out quick.
Search for ships if you need them. watch yourself in space.
try to drain on tatooine, but go to them with elis or cane addiss if you have to.
Gailid adds to drains, so get him out.
the engineer converts your chamber to the top, so against profit, start with jabba and chall, and use chall's game text to take the engineer into your hand. Don't forget to retrieve alot and use the search and destroy if they stay in space.

This is just a deck i made to be original since when has anybody played with tusken raiders? Please rate it based on what it is just a fun deck, nobody will take this to a tournament because is has weak spots that need to be covered, but for fun, it is a good deck to confuse your opponent.'
