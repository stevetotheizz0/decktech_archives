Strategy: '

**UPDATE 1.1**
The reason I’m starting with Endor is to basically give me a start with a twix site, you know, two for me and none for you, which goes along with the Strike Planning.   It is also a system that I can throw down asteroid sectors to and is a battle ground.  Squadron assignments is so that I will be able to throw down Gold 1 with Cal on the 1st turn of almost every game for 3.

The reason there are so many sites/0’s in the deck is because this deck is not meant to battle your opponent.  There are cards in here to run away or stop your opponent from battling you, eg. barrier, hyper escape, etc.  Thats why I have 3 darklighter spins in the deck, so I can kill pretty much anything without having to worry about drawing a 0 for battle destiny.
**END OF UPDATE 1.1**

You would be correct in noticing that this is an asteroid deck.  But it is a new version of the deck.

You start with Endor, HFTMF, Strike Planning, Squassin and any other effect you want depending on what they start and also your area.

Pull Cal into your hand first turn and drop him to Endor for 3 force.  If you get a big one you can drop that as well.	From there on you just set up your sanctuaries with your asteroids.

Card Choices

Tibrin is there to let you get back anything you want.

Rycars Run is for a small amount of retrieval mid or late game.

Darklighter Spin is there for huge destinies and for anti Zuckuss tech.  Its not a destiny so it aint 0.

Anoat is the best system to sit at and drain because you can always react away or to it for huge death.

Hobbie for his deploy of only 2 for him and his ship, total and able to cancel a destiny with Wedge.

Now for the Matchups

VS BHBM

Extra effect would be either Battle Plan or Insight depending on what type of deck it is.  Luke is in their for anti dueling and to bring some pain if they leave out a lone character somewhere.  Youll want to set up fast Hit them fast and hit them hard.  You should be able to win this game almost all of the time.  If they have space its even better.  Barrier any ties or star destroyers that come to the asteroids and take them out next turn with your asteroid destinies.  Ive killed 3 Executors with this deck by drawing an asteroid sector for destiny.  Drains at systems arent a problem as you can drop an asteroid sector to it and cancel the drain.

VS SYCFA Scum

This is probably the toughest matchup for this deck.  They get drains fast and in order to compete you have to set up sanctuary fast.  Starting against this deck is definitely Battle Plan.  They give you a second system to drop your asteroids to and so you can set up two sanctuaries faster than needing to draw for the second system.	It can beat it though, with enough force loss and your undercover spies blocking the drains.  Barrier what few ships they might bring at you.

VS TIES of any kind

This will be your easies matchup.  They come to space and die in the asteroids.  Play smart with your ships and sanctuaries.  Set them up at the Big Ones so they have to move to you.	Kill them with your asteroid destiny draws.  Easy as pie, or cake, or whatever it is you like to eat.

Well that pretty much does it for my strategy section.	If you have a specific deck type youd like to know about just D-mail me. I promise to answer back within a day.

Trust me, this deck wrecks.  Its always done well for me and people always say ”WTF?” when you start with only Endor and no objective.  It is a good deck despite the cheese factor of 9.8.  '
