Strategy: '

This deck is the final version of my Throne-Room-no-Revo deck.  The changes are substantial.  1) Regular Falcon replaced for Lando in Falcon.  2) No Nudjs.  Get Obi-Wan out fast for SA domination.  3) Harc Seff  4) Extra GB instead of COAS, it's just better.  5) 1 less spy.  A guy encouraged me to only use 2, and I liked it.  6) I changed the SA balance to 5-4 instead of 6-3.  7) Sorry About the Mess has been added.  Cool. 8) A change in the Obi-wan balance.  2 Premieres, 1 Epp, and 1 Ben's Saber. 9) Resulting from no Nudjs, I use the Forest instead of the Swamp.

If and when you review this, go and check out my MWYHL + Brent's Beats deck and tell me which one I ought to use at the tourney this Saturday, I would greatly appreciate it

The rest is strategy notes, which basically haven't changed, from the original version.  Sorry if I've forgotten to change anything.	Thanks for all your help

This deck very much depends on opponent involvement.  The main strategy is to get superior activation and then to beatdown.  Obviously, you start with the Throne Room + Careful Planning + Farm + Forest.  I don't use Revolution because I don't want to focus on that aspect.  That is what the opponent would expect, and it almost acts like you have extra cards in the deck if you don't play them, you know what I mean?  They fear the Revos, so they are careful, and you aren't even using them  You gain a slight advantage...

A problem that you'll run into is Big Blue.  You basically have to go to where they are.  Use Lando in Falcon + a pilot as your main ship, with the others as back up and for LC.  Use Ben, Luke, and others on the ground to whip up.

Here's some other ways to play against popular decks

Hunt Down-- They will be dead before they can say 'lose 1 force to Visage.'  You can cancel Visage with your spies, and you have enough duel protection to take Vader out of the party.  Work with your other mains elsewhere, and you should have a pretty good game.

Operatives-- Get your mains out there and battle baby	Get Battle Plan and Bacta Tank out and you should be in business.  Take out everything in sight, I mean EVERYTHING  You should have fun against this one.

ISB-- Another tough game.  Pray they aren't using Imp Arrest Order, but if they are you just have to divide and conquer.  Take out the lone scouts with Leia, Orrimaarko, Ben, Luke, Han + Chewie, etc.  Drain where possible, and get out Battle Plan quickly.  Run them out of Ghhhk's as fast as possible.  A game against ISB with this deck is hard but great fun.

Anything else-- take 'em out.	Period. Sense and Alter everything in existence, you MUST take control of the game.

This deck can never work just on it's own, it takes a lot of playskill.  It also needs to be tweaked, badly, so please give concrete suggestions for improvements.
