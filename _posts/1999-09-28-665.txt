Strategy: '

This is about the first deck I've made in about a month so go take it easy )

vs Ops	Start Careful Planning for the big activation and start pumping out mains and anti operative cards.  Get a drain going else where with little guys and block as many drains as you can.

vs Hunt Down  Find your dueling junk and cancel Visage asap.  Be sure to have some back up 4 ability character too.  Track around your Shocking Infos and take out Vader.

vs Big Blue  Set your stuff up and drain.  With destiny adders and all you can compile a pretty big army.

vs CCT Manipulator  This deck was specifically designed to murder this deck as it is becoming very popular.  2 Shocks and 2 Scrambled Transmission will ensure that you can hit em up everytime.

You'll always want to start Careful Planning and pull your sites.  Great activation for relatively little set up.

Good luck'
