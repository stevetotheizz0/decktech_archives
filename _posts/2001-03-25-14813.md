Strategy: '

Take out frozen assets put in ICBW.


Ok first of all this is my profit deck with a twist of high destinies and other stuff like that. 


You might want to put a Cantina in for some other cards.


Why I Put Some Cards In.


Geezum- He Pulls the sites...just in case, you might want to put Orri in insted


Frozen Assets- Agenst Court, or CCT with Jabbas Prize, it kills your opponet with your low deploying people that are power +2. Also slows em down if needed.


How Did We Get Into This Mess?- Oh man, this card rules, trackable destiny 4, and lets you cycle out a bad hand untill you get a new one


Dune Sea- You can do how did we get into this mess there.


Control- I don’t have any space, so this cancels their drains.


Don’t Froget The Droids- Destiny 6, can help if you just got your self killed in a battle, and numbers protection.


I think all the rest of the cards sort of explain them selfs.




When playing with this deck you will want to start with Heading to the meadical frigate to get aim high, the SAC protection, and Insurrection. If your playing agenst Court MKOS , CCT or some tatooine deck, signal and frozen assets might be a better choice.Also you try to get HDWGITM working PDQ, so you can cycle thourgh to get all the cards you need. And always retrive with harvest.


Ok heres how I play agenst other decks


SYCFA- Start Heading to the frigate, with the normal effects, set up drains, and by the time you’ve lost 10 force unfreeze Han and beat the crap out of em with drains on the ground. This should be pretty easy. 


Court, MKOS, CCT, or any other Tatooine deck- Start signal and Frozen Assets, and beat up on their characters untill you unfreeze Han then drain them dead.


Hunt Down- Start with the frig. stuff and get a spy to the visage place if they don’t have ephant, or cancel it with transmission termanated. Back up your Locs. as well as you can and attck if you need to, try to drain them as much as possible.


Hunt Down Numbers- Start Normal crap, unfreeze Han, cancel their Visage, use don’t froget the droids to cancel odds. This should your easiest matchup.


BHBM- Get Luke to a battle ground, unfreeze Han early, hit em with big loss. Fairly Easy Matchup.


Any other space deck- See SYCFA



Well Its about midnight and I gatta go to bed, I hope you enjoy my profit with a twist.  '
