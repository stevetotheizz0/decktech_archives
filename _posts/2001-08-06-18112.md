MISC PURP CARD(1)

I did it

Strategy: '

pretty much a tat main deck, only I tried to make it more versatile by adding other means of force loss besides plain old beatdown (drain enhancement and podrace)



1st turn

-pull han and madine w/ Strike planning 

-activate

-drop shimi and threepio to quarters

-if you have enough force, drop madine to slave quarters and pull geezum, kensaric if geezum is not available. unfortunately, geezum will probably have to wait for turn two.

-draw if any available and you feel like you will have enough force next turn


turn two

-activate

-drop geeezum, or pull a site with geezum if he’s already out.  drop another scout.


basically keep pulling all sites with geezum and drawing up a couple here and there a couple turns.


by turn six AT MOST, 6 destiny 0s will be out of the deck, three (at least) ones, and two twos.

this makes podracing a little easier, as well as threepio, who is already going.


several destiny adders help in battles(skywalkers, leia w/ balster, entering the arena, gift OTM) and han can cancel one as well.


As I said earlier, Han, Chewie, Madine, Geezum, Shimi, Threepio, Kensaric, and probably Qui-Gon will be out before too long


Barrier and It can wait help defend punks like tessek who have a tendancy to draw attention.  It can wait is awesome for setting up beatdowns.


Just in case they go space, tessek and c fans help with drains.  if necessary, they can go for forfeit fodder on the ground.


 Away put your weapon can be pretty cool against decks like hunt down (NO LIGHTSABER FOR YOU)


 Too close for comfort is just cool


 see above for old ben p


 Basically I tried to make a deck that would do well battling and draining, although I can see how something like Ties might be able to mess me up, but that’s OK lol.


 thx for your reviews
