Strategy: '

btw this isn’t actually david fairbanks i just dont have an account so he let me use his


ok, like i said this deck takes some skill to play, so let me go through what this deck trys to do


why it works...


well first you only have a six card start which is pretty good considering some of the massive starts some have.  The fact that you give your opponent 2 force and you only get 3 sucks, but  you only need 3 to bust out yoda so that works out fine.  Another reason it works is the destiny 7 in everything once you flip, plus massive retrival, when you flip allyour peeps are immune to attrition less then 4(test three subtracts one from destiny and yoda lops two off the attrition) o yea, and dont let anyone tell you you need battle grounds, if your opponent has none, just kill em with test 6, if they have some, take em over, is this so hard?

so first turn you wanna go through and pull the hut, if its in there, if not you have some @#$% luck, that has never happened to me, same with yoda, who you drop to the hut this turn, he doesnt move the rest of the game.

second turn assuming you dont get @#$% luck and put daughter in your massive 6 card forcepile go ahead and drop her, if in hand drop her, just get her out.  get the training area, get test one, play test one(on opponents turn get test two)

turn three

well you should complete test one, you need a four, and the destinys in here are decent to say the least, pull the jungle, drop test two there and pull test three, move to test two(opponents trun pull test 4)

turn 4

complete your test, you need a four again, drop test three, its immeadiatly done(this is all assuming your opponent is smart and doesnt move test two to the hut), pull the swamp drop test 4 , go there, get test 5

turn 5

complete test 4 grab the bog clearing, drop that, drop test 5 at the hut( that is beyond key, otherwise bubo might make an appearance, and remember leia has 2 landspeed)

turn 6

flip leia, im hoping by this point you tracked your 7, if not, meh, you have another 2 turns thats more then enough time, and btw you want as few cards in reserve as possible in case they pull the omni box, which nobody is smart enough to play with

turn 7

chill, draw your 7, get 10 force, this is assuming secret plans isnt out, and if it is, meh you got alot of force activated


well thats the jist of it anyway, this whole thing i just wrote assumes they do nothing these 7 turns, well you got @#$% to keep em from doing stuff, lets look


battle plan slows most drain decks, and if they foolishly go to an exterior planet site drop a projection, or lose them in the wilderness, plus you got it could be worse to stop some damage


a gift this will help soooo much vs mykos or court, this is why there are 2 artoos, which btw they can pull a gift


honor, get it some how, YISYW gets it, so does signal


the beatdown crew

now im sure youre saying, god damn that is the worst character selection ive ever seen, well maybe it is, but nobody plays huntdown dueling around here, so i dont have to worry about luke or obi going out of play, and the luke han combo is awesome, 9 force for 9 power, two weapons and two destinys, when you flip that is just insane, and before the flip thats usually enough to clear a site, vs court if you think theyre gonna be eaten, thats what strangle/whaaaaaoooow are for, read em if you dont know what they do. 


as far as test 6 goes, its mainly just direct damage if they dont play with vader, and if they do, feel free to take leia there


random matchups....

vs space.....

use your claws, get massive beatdowns, luke and han on random corvette are all good, luke in his mope ship is awesome, two of your 5 draw destiny by themselves, just be sure to pick your fights


vs mykos/court

well anyway a gift and some other techness tend to own them, unless you play a badass like tj, then youre raped, but otherwise youre good


vs isb.....

um, beadown i guess, hmm, test one....owns them eh? well yes yes it does, btw it does not modify the drains so random cards do not stop it


vs huntdown....

well nobody is smart enough to play dueling, with this in mind your peeps are safe, visage will hurt, but try and get honor out and beat em out of the battlegrounds, i dont play with TT cause the good players just get it back anyway


vs bhbm....

well i never play bhbm, and if i do, i lose, wow big deal if this deck wins all its matchups but one that is insane


vs numbers...

get that effect out, check and mate


vs stuff on cloud city

just go there early and beatdownthey cant do much


well with all this in mind, just remember that this strat sucked, but this deck in the hands of a good player is one of the best decks out there   '
