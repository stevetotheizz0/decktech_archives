Strategy: '

Like I said, this is a revised version of the HB I posted not long ago. The general idea is the same, but I added some new elements to it. 

First, I know that Kiffex is not in here. My logic there is that with only ten starfighters, I won’t be able to hold both Kiffex and Kessel, and Kessel is a better deal for me. I am trying to keep the generation the enemy gets from me to a minimum. If I get a big fight in space, I’m going to concentrate on holding Sullust and Kessel and not worry about the others. 

Sullust is the Hidden Base because I can play Haven there, and because of the depoly +1 for the enemy. With the errata, I’m excpecting them to deploy at a system (even if I occupy it), probe, and move away all in the same turn. I can stop that with Rebel Barrier and smash them good when my turn comes.   

I got the idea to add Menace Fades from the HB in the expert section. It’s actually a very good idea, since the forests almost garuntee that I’ll always have presence there. Incidentally, that’s also why I use matching pilots, so I can send some down if necessary. 

I dropped the Organized Attacks because I realized that I don’t really need them. Everybody is immune to <4 with I’ll Take the Leader, and just about everyone had some immunity anyway so attrition is not a serious threat. 

Slight Weapons Malfunction is great because I can use it in the air or on the ground if the enemy tries to oust me from the forset. Three of my beatdown mains get a battle destiny anyway, and two can be targetted by SWM (Leia is both).   

Ok, I think the rest is pretty self-explainitory. Thank you for your time.       '
