Strategy: '

First thing u need to do is get your people down onto Dagobah get the Ithorians and the clouds and train somebody with the first 2 tests.

If your opponent is playin air then drop the Characters with piloting ability's onto the capital ship's and try and get the drain's going as fast as u can while u take out there fleet.

If they are playing ground then play your main's and other's on there planet and beat them down and take over while u drain on Dagobah and in the clouds.
