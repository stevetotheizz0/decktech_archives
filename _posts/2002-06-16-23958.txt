Strategy: 

Well, pretty boring Jabba’s palace deck. I used to capture, but I don’t bother to anymore.

Control Tatooine: Jabba’s palace fast, and start to bring out your other sites. Yuo should have no shortage of characters, and you shuld be able to put a good force at the audience chamber fast. Then also control the rest of the palace sites with lesser aliens.

none shall pass and imperial barrier will make it hard for an opponent to beat you on your turf, especially if you are cancelling a battle destiny with boelo, a second one with jodo cast if need be.

Your force drains can go as high as like 8, which isn’t too shabby, and scum and villainy might help you retrieve some force (capturing isn’t worth it)

The only problem I see is leia, rebel princess and cards like Great warrior that get rid of force drain modifiers. Speaking of which, do you know of a way to make my force drains unmodifiable by opponent. Because that kills the deck good.

I also though about EV 9D9 at the workshop, but he didn’t make the cut.
