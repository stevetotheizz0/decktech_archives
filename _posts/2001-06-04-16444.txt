Strategy: '

Playing Take control of Bespin early, and then turn to contolling the ground. Get your Run away cards in your hand, and Start draining and Celebrating. This deck drains for about 6 a turn, 9 if you have Pucimir Tryrss down. It retrieves three a turn, and it makes opponet pay three for each of their drains, and it cancels their bonuses. If they come to you set up a path/run luke run/SATM beatdown. Clear them out of coud city and continue draining and retriving. Great drain and retrivel potential.

The Cards 

Stay Sharp This card is totally tech. Take out a starship early, or just add seven to your power with an intuder missle. + its a used interrupt. 

Either Way You Win Great way to build up your activation to get set up, and if they dont want to let you activate, Fine you get to retrieve

Blue 5 + Ten Numb Deploys for 2 and has 6 power, put a Imissle on it and Fire your X cannons first and your weapon deatiny is + 7 track you destinies and you can hit the executor Great for holding the system, awesome combined with stay sharp and power pivot

Matchups

Huntdown If their podracing race with anikins pod and if you lose just retrieve all your force back. Keep luke on table to stop visage, and just keep the drains and retieval going, and you should win.

BHBM Give them luke. Run away from their Battles then set up a beatdown. Retrieve any force you lose, and drain them for tons. Shoot down any ships that come near, and dont make any mistakes, and you should win. 

You May Start Your Landing Their drain bonuses are cnacelledm retrieve all you lose with Celebration, and drain for tins while they drain for nothing. Their walkers cant battle at interior sites so no worries. Easy win if you dont let them take the system. COntorl of the system is key Its easy with the weapons, Power Pivot, Power, Stay Eharp, Etc. 

TDIGWATT Take the system away from them, and set up the beatdown, run away from battles drain, and retrive. They wont be able to spred for dark deal because of the beatdown, and they wont have CC Occ because you have the system. Tough game, but if you play samrt you can win.
