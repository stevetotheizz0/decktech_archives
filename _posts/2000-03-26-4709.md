Strategy and other stuff
Well, as you can tell, this has the basic outlines of pretty much ever other Profit deck out there. The only difference other than minor stuff, is that this is a more mains, less tech oriented deck. One reason is that I don't have any Master Lukes or some of the smaller stuff like Double Agent. However, I believe I have amde up for techness, with battling power.

Free Han as quick as possible, don't really worry about waiting to retrieve, making opponent lose force is better than retrieving your own force. If the opponent is playing a keepaway type deck, just flip and drain the hell outta him. I realize that some decks such as operatives would definetely out drain you, thats why the docking bays are there to take the fight to them, also Nabrun will help here.

Well, I guess the rest of the deck is pretty self-explanatory. If not, I'm too lazy to type up the rest, just go look at the strategy to another Profit deck, most of them similar and this one isn't much different. Anyways, have fun and happy gaming '
