Epic Event (1)


Commence Primary Ignation '

Strategy: '

Okay, okay I play this objective flipped, sue me.

First turn pull Kuat and Commence Primary Ignation.

Activate Force. Search for the warroom. If you saw

only one d* cannon in reserve deck then draw until you get

the cannon. you need this cannon as fast as possible

you can use Weapon Levitation as well to get the cannon.

Pull every Turn a Death Star Gunner. If deathstar parsec=2

then deploy the gunners and next turn bomb this @#$%ing

alderaan planet.

deploy a ship and a pilot to death star. Next turn one to 

Kuat (with pilot). If you’re strong enough than deploy a

Presence Of The Force. Now you drain for three at the D*,

and on Kuat. Deploy Chiraneau, to drain him for four.

Chimaera and Thrawn on Kiffex and he will die after few turns.


Try to hold the Accuser in hand. If opponent

want to battle you then react by deploying the accuser

(for 3 force only to Death star). bang he’s dead.

You will lose only the accuser. that’s okay.

In your phase play I’ve Lost Artoo and Lateral Damage.

May be a ship to same location. The Battle Damage will be too 

high and you can win the game in only one battle.


Menace Fades would kill this deck.

It’s pretty hard if opponent prevents a high drain

and gonna have to lose only four cards instead of 13.

Your only Chance is ’I’ve Lost Artoo’ and ’Lateral Damage’.

But It’s a good chance to win the game.
