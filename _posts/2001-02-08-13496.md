Starting


Start by pulling out the docking bays, and use Luke to drain. Spread your speeders out to diffrent docking bays. You will get huge activation with Staging areas and huge drains with I’ll take the leader. Destoy your opponent on the ground and take over his sites, and drain for even more. If you get down to the Tat sites you can drain for tons with T-47 battle formation. Win battles and Retrieve. Don’t let them hold anything. 


Matchups


BHBM Tough game,  Win a couple of battles and drain once you have a couple cards stacked then track the Ewok Catapult and Cross Vader. Game.

Watch yourself though, never underestimate the power of the darkside.


Huntdown Destroy him off all of his sites and you can always hide luke from duels in a Vecicle. Drain for a bunch and If they come to space strike when they dont expect it. Good Game, but I have done it many times. 


MKOS & COURT Crush them if they come to exterior sites and if they don’t just drain them to death. If they go to space kill them their to. Good Game, but not much they can do. 


Ties Drain as fast as you can and get your ships into your hand. Very TOugh Game, but if you use your tricks and I’ll take the leader to reduce his ties power. Thne user all power and beat down in space. Drain a bunch and you can win. 


Very Fun Deck and Definetly can win. I love it and I hope to use it in a tourney this Saturaday.


Any constuctive reviews would be great. 


Thanks '
