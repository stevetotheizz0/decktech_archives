Strategy: '

This is a very fast DB Ops deck. It normally flips on turn 4, but a 2nd turn flip has been done. Start by getting the swamp and nudj, and repeat the next two turns so you have 3 locals and 3 Nudjs. Goo nee Tay is also very good, it makes Imps like vader and Mara deploy 10 to dantooine. Once the Nudjs are out, deploy 3 rebels (and more characters if you want) and flip the objective. Keep a good hold on two of the three locations, preferably Swamp and Forest.
Once flipped, go into space. A squadron will give drains of 4 at Kessel and Coruscant + another 3 at kiffex. Use the Falcon to do K run, so you can make it in one go.

VS ISB

They will still be able to deploy their agents to dantooine (cos they*re all spies) so you will have to beat them up. Lost in the wilderness is for 5D6-RA-7 if they send him to dantooine. You should be able to beat on them on the ground, and if you pull off a quick flip, the space drains will hurt

VS HD

Be careful. You may want to substitute a Nabrun Leids for a transmission terminated if HD is popular in your area, but there is still boushh to cancel it. There is plenty of Anti-dueling stuff in the deck, so don*t be too worried. they will have a hard time trying to sense things while HD is on flip side, even with DV, they will have to draw a 1

VS COTVG

Could be the biggest problem, as aliens are unaffected by goo nee tay and the objective*s deploy increase. Don*t spread too thin, or they will beat you down. Get into space fast, you will have the advantage.

vs This deal is getting worse.....

Don*t let them get DD going. If neccessary, flip DBO then go all out on cloud city and space, so you can stop them controlling 3 sites. If they do get it going, your -1 will help. Best way is to stop them before they flip.

VS Heavy space

SFS will get trashed by the squads and superfalcon, but BIG BLUE could be more of a problem. You will have to keep dantooine safe, and pick your battles carefully. If they try to deploy on the ground, Kill them
