Strategy: 

*****UPDATE****
I just saw a mistake in the deck list.	Boba Fett With Blaster Rifle should be Captain Needa.




HB:  Start w/ Security Precautions.  Get control of your two Endor sites and go up in space.  There are 9 ships in this deck and most of the characters are pilots.  Try to get out Battle Order so they either have to deploy to the DB [if they don't have any battleground sites] and get beatdown or pay 3 force for a force drain.
-If it's a fake HB w/ Celebration get control of the celebration planet and drain.
-If it's a Falke HB get control of Alderaan, Tibrin, and Tatooine.

Ops:  Start w/ Imperial Decree.  Get control of your two Endor sites and go up in space.  Try to get out Battle Order and they won't be draining much.   Then just drain and if they have a weak site, battle.

Profit:  Start w/ Resistance, Secret Plans, and There Is No Try.  Get control of your Endor sites, send up some ships, and then go beat them down on Tattooine.

Yavin 4:  Start w/ Resistance, Secret Plans, and There Is No Try.  Since Y4 decks usually don't have any battlegrounds or a lot of space, you should be able to win.  Get control of your Endor sites and try to stack up the Docking Bay because that's the only place they'll be able to battle you. [Especially if you get Ephant Mon at the Bunker].  Revo protection is Imperial Decree.


Tech:

Ephant Mon at the Bunker
Use I'd Just As Soon As Kiss A Wookie against Landing Claw and then bet them down
Gravity Shadow = Kills X-wing Swarm
