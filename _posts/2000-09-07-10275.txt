ISB

Strategy: 

This is the deck I've been fooling around with.  Its a good deck, but has a weakness to Profit... you gotta watch yourself against it.	I built this deck because I don't want to play BHBM or ROps.  This is original.

If you can't figure out the strategy you should go play YJ, because you obviously suck at this game.

Flip ISB with 2 ISB's at either dbay, flip and then move em the hell out of there.  Coruscant DBay is in over Ds2 DBay because I'd like to have another planet site for Decree.  The MMoves and SHUOD are in to kill the Tank and the Savrip.

Use ISB to retrieve an ISB, and then use Pol Treidum to smash an Undercover spy.

Uhh thats all I can think of right now.
