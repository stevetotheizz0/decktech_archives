Strategy: '

**********Update***********
Take out the 2 Darth Mauls for Another DengarWGun and add a regular Dr. Evanzan. And replace the combo with the regular version. that means you should have -2 Darth Maul’s and +1 Dengar wGun and 2x Dr. Evanzan.
*********End Update*********

Back To good old Alien Mains. Back To My Roots(My first good dark side deck.) Always there when I need it and is all about my favorite aspect of SWCCG(POWER) and shooting and capturing. This deck deals out the damage while letting you retrieve when you need to and even when you don’t

Here is a run down on How my game will usually go.

Early Game- you should be activating at least 5 and in upwards of 7 on the 1st turn. Grab Jabba using the Chamber’s GT. Deploy him there,  and use power to get Ephant Mon for the early drop. Look for Tat DB and deploy any useful effects. I always like to get out Search and Destroy early so they are losing like 2 every turn.Ouch Now you should have a force out on the second turn. Ex... At The Chamber-Jabba,Boelo,Ephant Mon, Xizor. All good. and you should always keep at least a bounty hunter in hand so you can wipe out you’re opponent.

Mid Game- seeing as there is not much strategy to this deck you can run a rampage on Tatooine and capture or kill any light side character that moves...Don’t forget to make them lose to you ’re objective if there too scared to occupy on Tatooine, which is ususally the case. Also by now Boba Fett should be doing what he does best using Hidden Weapons and Taging EPP Characters. Ohh there going too space and Dash is up there Drainging at kessel...Not good for them go get Fett and zuckuss and then lat damage Dash and he’ll crash and Burn. Same for the Super Falcon, Lat. Damage, Crash and Burn. Ohhh you lost Zuckuss in Ship, Retrieve him with Scum and Villany. use MAul and MAra to go get the Light side on there own turf.

Late Game- anything you’re losing should be coming back too you. So you should be fine. Keep at the desoying of there characters and the game will be your’s- 

Card Choices*******
 Doubles of all the mains- I like to have good characters even if you do have doubles in you’re hand you should be fine, that’s still 14 characters to drop down.
 2x Disarmed- Ohhh no it’s Jedi Luke..Barrier he stays next turn Disarmed-Power 5 Jedi luke Ouch
 2x Sniper- Ohh noooo. EPP Han and Leia Barrier Leia. wait til you’re turn and disarmed Han and snipe Leia and that’s a big Force swing for you.
 Lat Damage- Dash is giving you trouble Lat. Damage and hell shut up when Boba and Zuckuss are Chasing him around.
 Search and Destroy- 2 force lost every turn if there not coming to me and they are staying in space... Or better yet luke is stayin at the Tat DB...that’s still 2 force he’s destiny 6.
 Shut Him Up...- Bacta tank is coming back in force, every smart person in my meta plays with it so I play with this card so there tank EPP Obi won’t be coming out to play anytime soon.

Matchups*******

Profit- Pales in comparison, Naked 3po giving you hassels, drop Dengar Wgun and Snipe him. Jedi Captured all over the place and Han won’t even make it out of Jabbas Palace. Ohhh. and start Secret Plans instead of all Wrapped Up, and Start Jabba and Boba Fett, 2 destinies.

QMC- This deck can’t do nothing, just take my friend IG-88 and Boba Fett and go kill Pucmirr Thyress and they won’t have nothing left except for ....Dash...Sorry dash got Wacked ever other time so he’s not gonna survive now.

RST- this deck usually stays on Endor to blow the bunker. So get some hunters on Crix early and that should be the game... See Kensaric adds to Characters and whaddya know I just dropped Droids like IG-88 on you. And you’re Jedi Luke is sitting in my dungeon. Mara, Maul and Iggy can hold the bunker easily, you should also have no problem cuz close air support is exterior sites only, WIN

TIGIH- Looks like Luke will be left alone, cuz nobody of my squad wants to play with Him, Especially Mara, so leave her out of this. If you have to track and snipe Luke easier said than done Right...? You should still win cuz they wont come to TAT  each turn

HB- Well they can be playing 2 versions, 1st all Air which will be easy enough cuz they will spread out which leaves them vulnerable to attack and you can Lat Damage whoever is nice for the picking and go and kill them.2nd They can be playing DB ground and Air- that will be a more 1 sided match- you can dominate there EPP characters and to add salt to the wound drain at there DB’s. WIN

WYS- They can’t flip there objective if all there gay Smugglers are captured, and if they do use mirax and Dash go get them with you’re space- No flipped WYS make me Happy Win

EBO- This is a tough match- The only reason I’m posting this matchup is because it may be big in other areas, but not in Alderran. Anyways they will get going early, don’t drop you’re Bounty Hunter ships you may get x-wing swarmed. Better yet DB transit in and deploy to the ridge and push them in and you might cancel EBO. Main reason Zev, hobbie, and Wedge, can’t stand up against me, Not even EPP Obi and Luke can.

Well this deck is fun to play and is very Power centered and moves fast and is character controlling. If you don’t like decks like this than rate me anyways and go on with you’re life, but you’re missing out. Play Hard and Have Fun
