Strategy: 

K...got a tournament coming up and I want to enter this deck in it...please help me improve it to it’s best...review constructively please...

On opponents turn: Grab both your generals with strike planning if you don’t have em...

1st turn: Activate, get bo shuda and the mos espa docking bay preferable but if not the home one docking bay is cool...if you can get crix and then go get chewie of kashyyk and put em at mos espa docking bay...any extra force do what you want...

2nd turn to mid game: concentrate on getting tessek to the audience chamber, getting secure route on your docking bay and getting your other sites out...use bargaining table and your objective to cancel drains and destinies...palace raiders to react to everything...should have some heavy drains going now...

End of Mid game to Late Game: Try for that celebration if you can...if you already got it going great...finish em off...

So I think this is a solid deck that should be able to compete against mostly everything...The strategy section is kinda vague but I just threw this together so the way I see my self playin it is with my docking bay and cantina fortified while my palace raiders are reacting around screwing the opponent...it has good retrieval adn drain power and can really surprise you in battle...if htere’s something you think that can really help me though feel free to say so...thanks for reviewing
