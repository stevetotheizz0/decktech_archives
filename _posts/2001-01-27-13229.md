Strategy: '

If you want you can take out a Kiffex and put in 3 yavin 4â€™s. This way when they look through your deck you can make them think it is not your HB.
At the start of the game pull Crix Madine. From there you pull a Raliter Frieghter Captain. When you get all of or almost all of your systems out (Raliter and Kessel a must) you flip your Obj (obviously),then you pull Kessel Run if you dont already have it and target a raliter frieghter captain at raliter on Lando In Falcon. Make sure You have Back-up at kessel like Red Squad. 1 and 4 with pilots and an x-wing laser cannon on RS4. Use Luke, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han With gun, and Chewie With Gun to destroy them on the ground. Use Boushh and HB to block/cancel force drains. Use Effective Repairs to get Kessel Run Back Into your hand after you complete it so you can retreive the effective repairs and you should end up with no lost force at the end of the game. '
