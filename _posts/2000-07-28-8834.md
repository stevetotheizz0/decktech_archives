Strategy: '

The start for this deck is always Main Power Generators and North Ridge, with a Signal for A New Secret Base.	First turn, you pull out Echo Base Garrison and the Echo Command Center, and use Garrison to deploy Zev Senseca to the Command Center.	On your next turn, grab the Bacta Tank and the two other Echo sites to provide more activation put some room between Zev and the North Ridge. If the opponent tries to kill Zev, you can still beat them down at the Main Power Generators or Echo Docking Bay.  Now, you can deploy both Maneuvering Flaps and Incom Corporation without fear of either one being canceled.  You have an additional five signals and an Effective Repairs floating around in your deck, so pulling the effects you need to either neutralize the opponent's strategy or pump up your own should be no problem.  You should always deploy Incom Corporation and Maneuvering Flaps, because both are absolutely necessary to succeed.  T-47s are entirely unexpected and extremely powerful against a variety of decks, which I will discuss below.

Ralltiir Operations
I designed this deck to take out Ralltiir Operations with ease.  Your opponent certainly will not be accustomed to you deploying cards with power 5 and ability 2 to Ralltiir for a deploy cost of 1.  You can use Romas, Beezer, or Frozen Assets to stop the opponent's reacting on Ralltiir.  You can use Undercover spies or Projections to block their drains at a few sites, and then deploy a ton of speeders to the other two sites.  Do Or Do Not protects Projections from being canceled and Bacta Tank protects your spies from Bubo and Trample.	Commander Wedge can be pulled with Echo Base Garrison and is awesome tech against Search And Destroy.

Space
You can freely drain on the ground at your drain-2 locations and use Landing Claws and the Rebel Leaders to block drains in space.  Yoxgit can be protected under the Hoth shield and keeps retreiving those Landing Claws if the opponent cancels them during their move phase.

Hunt Down
Most Hunt Down decks use exterior sites anyway, so you should have a tremendous advantage already.  Simply beat down Vader at the dokcing bays or wherever with raw power.  Honor Of The Jedi deals with Visage quite nicely.  Civil Disorder is the real clincher against this deck.'
