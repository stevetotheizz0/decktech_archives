Strategy: 

I have played this deck and I know it works
		    because its 15 and 0 against 15 four star
		   It’s  pretty simple to play and doesnt require
		    too much difficult destiny tracking until later
		    in the game. Your goal is to drain/battle
		    them out without being too dependant on
		    either one. I use a very nice little machine
		    that my friend Josk Gatrez cooked up for
		    me that helps me battle better. What you
		    do is get out S and V ASAP and start
		    deploying your Bounty Hunters and
		    Jabba/Gailid and Mosep/Bib Fortuna. Save
		    the Abyssins for canceling drain, Den of
		    Thieves, and later in the game, fining there
		    weakest ground point and deploying six
		    Abyssin for one force each and mutilating
		    them. Now back to the machine. It
		    combines these five cards: Projectives
		    Telepathy, S and V, First Strike, Abyssins
		    and Ghhhk. What you do is deploy
		    something to a place that the opponent has
		    presence, on the ground, deploy an
		    Abyssin and initiate battle. You retrieve
		    three force do to S and V/First strike and
		    they lose one force. You then can either
		    cancel the battle with a Pro. Tel. or
		    continue, lose the Abyssin and regenerate
		    him and Ghhhk away the rest of the battle
		    damage. You can also do this in space
		    even against an X-wing swarm. Deploy
		    Dengar, Bossk and IG-88 in their ships at
		    different places. Put Bossk at there
		    weakest point along with one other ship
		    and deploy dengar or IG by themselves.
		    Fight with Bossk and co. and Cancel the
		    Battle with Dengar, then move them all
		    together and they wont be able to knock
		    you down. Repeat as necessary. Some
		    people may think I have low activation but I
		    dont really. Thanks to Jabba himself I
		    activate 1 force every time I drain with an
		    alien so drain even if your draining for
		    nothing. Thanks to No Bargain and None
		    Shall Pass anyone who attempts to invade
		    will have a bear of a time trying to keep
		    their people alive. I can swarm them with
		    abyssins from the Den of Thieves and
		    unless (1) they have the system on table (I
		    dont put it in the deck) or (2) they are
		    playing Nabrun Leids they cant run and
		    they cant hide. You will try to have flipped
		    by your third turn which should be no
		    problem. I have Reactor Terminal so you
		    can recycle all those lovely high destinys
		    (the average red card destiny in this deck is
		    a four). Dont do much battling until your
		    deck is down to about 18-20 cards with
		    about 50% five destinies and clump them
		    together using Reactor Terminal and track
		    them so those nice little X-wings can
		    swarm only to find themselves facing 12+
		    attrition with no ammunity.
		     Hutt influence will cut any
		    nonsense about canceling my drains
		    because I just match one Abyssin w/ one
		    Bounty Hunter and they cannot stop me.
		    Ive got to go now but I will add anything I
		    think of later ASAP. Thanks for taking the
		    time to read this.
