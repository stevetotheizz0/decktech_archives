Strategy: '

Basic stratgy here is to use YWTMTJN to pull all of he necessary aliens. Then just spread and drain with the Jawas. Siestas boost their forfiet and the Tank/Savrip/Chimes makes for re-usable Jawas. I'm not ging to waste time explaining how to play vs. Huntdown, Court, etc. Use your imagination.

In response to the reviews

Dune Sea Sabacc isn't in there because it would take too many slots to be effective. I'd need 3+ sabaccs, R'kik, and a way to stack destiny.

Sandwhirls are cool. Another probably wouldn't be a bad idea. Note that it is a Mobile Effect so it can't be cancelled by Alter, only by Control. There isn't really any room for ships here. I could do two leaders + two claws. Then I'd need a Yoxgit, too. Just takes up too much room. Battle Order will slow me down, but not too much.

True, Profit doesn't help me much, but it is better than TatJP + Careful Planning. Getting ten force back is cool.

One Kalit is enough in this deck. He can be fetched with YWTMTJN or Aved Lunn. He's pretty safe at the Chamber Bo Shuda stops battles; Rennek stops attacks. If he should happen to get killed via Sniper or a seeker or something, he can always go to the Tank.
