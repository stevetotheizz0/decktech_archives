Strategy: '

This is a revised version of a deck I submitted a few weeks back, updated with Reflections II and more battling tech.  Ill go ahead and give a review of the first few turns to tell you how it works.

Turn One Pull Home One Docking Bay and Dagobah, which then pulls Yodas Hut.  I usually dont put a guy down at the Home One Docking Bay, but if youre got Barrier/Portal, etc., you may want to put Tawss Khaa or Corran Horn there.

Turn Two Pull Tatooine or Cloud City Docking Bay and Aquaris.  Youll probably want to put a ship down to Aquaris this turn, you have 8 cards that will get you solid space power. (two of each ship, two of each pilot, two ships, plus Squassin) or if you are against a space deck you may want to put a guy at a Docking Bay instead (not neccesarily Home One Docking Bay)

Turn Three You are now activating big, check what locations you have deployed, 10 force from yourself, even if you havent deployed anything yet.  If your opponent then gives you about 3, you got some characters at a docking bay, and a ship at Aquaris, thats 18 force  Now all you have to do is deploy that last docking bay to get you even more force, but beware, you activated so much, the docking bay may be in your force pile.  Depending on your hand, beatdown your opponent, fortify a docking bay, or just draw some more cards.

The rest of the game is simple, start your tracking with your recyclers, activate huge amounts (its not uncommon to activate 20+ on turn 4) and go fight your opponent wherever he is.  Use all of your Interrupts/Effects well, and youll win the war on the ground and in the air.  The kicker is the retireval in this deck, not affected by CHYBC, Secret Plans, and only mildly by Something Special Planned For Them, because I usually retrieve only 2-4 times per game anyway.

The card selections are pretty self explanatory, they work with your characters and starships while putting the hurt on your opponent.  Courage + Jedi Presence is a sick combo, get it together with Jedi Luke + Saber, at the same site as Obi-Wan (or move him over with Run Luke, Run) and play the two interrupts, giving you a total power of 33, 37 if you pulled off Run Luke, Run as well.  In space, move Super Falcon over to a weak system, when they deploy, barrier them, and since they wont want to lose 3 to Order, theyll battle, you play Punch It, draw 5 battle destiny and clear them out.  

What About Guri/Imperial Command?
of course I am worried about these cards hurting my space forces, but this deck doesnt HAVE to be able to hang in space, you dont have a Battle Plan to hurt you, or OMDH/Kessel Runs that must be completed.   So don’t sweat it if you aren’t winning the war in space.

Okay, now for matchups

Hunt Down
Dueling hunt down is of course every mains decks worst nightmare, but this definately isnt an auto-loss.  Youll want to start out slower than normal, drawing quite a few cards to get your combos together, dont worry about the Visage damage at this point, itll be retrieved later.  Get your duel cards and mains together and go fight, Portal their scrubs (or the occasional Mara, just track the destiny) and Levitate lightsabers, then barrier the backup next turn.  Then they have to decide on whether to lose to Order or battle you, etc.  

BHBM
This deck has gotten noticably weaker with the introduction of Rebel Scout Luke, I know this from personal experience with my own BHBM deck.  BHBM just cant do enough damage and/or win enough battles against this deck.  While his objective is hurting him, youre retrieving your losses.  Be careful not to get careless in space, or else Zuckuss + Bossk or a Star Destroyer or two could ruin your day.

Scum
This strategy covers all varients of Scum, including most CCT and some Agents decks.  Scum is a usually a very tough opponent for a LS deck that battles to win, but I usually dont have much trouble with Scum because I can either put early pressure on the Audience Chamber, or draw up to make a real powerful force to fight them, it just depends on my hand.  Ben and Lando have a field day in this match up.  Just play smart and remember your Fallen Portals.

Ties/Space in general
DS space has gotten a big boost with the introduction of Thrawn, but dont get intimidated by a power 15 Chimaera, it wont stand up to Falcon + Outrider.  The big threat here is Lateral Damage/Imperial Command, so you need to set up at your docking bays for draining and retrieving as well.  Youll eventually outlast them while beating up their space as much as you can (remember that you have two of all of your space forces, if one is killed, dont worry too much)

Thats all Im going to put for now, heres a list of cards Ive been trying to add
