Strategy: 

I know, I know, "Presence of the Force?!? Wat is he doing?". Personally I like the first turn flip. That means a quick 2 force loss (drain and Xizor at bg). The only thing I found is that this deck is pretty slow. The optimum idea would be to capture Luke or make him missing (ATWYS). That way he loses one a turn. The only threat to this deck is TIGIH because he gives Luke to Empy and that’s 2 a turn. Battle Order to stop drains, Hut Smooch to stop spies, Ommi Box/Info Exchange to stop tracking.

Here are some matchups:

Vs. EBO- Find Battle Plan ASAP. PLay Guri in Stiner and with DiP1 and the rest of the gang, they’ll wish they played something else.

vs. TIGIH- A tough match. I don’t deploy Empy, I just try to take out the people with my BHs. The AO helps me too.
