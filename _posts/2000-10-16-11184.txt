Strategy: 

So there ain’t a LS, JK in there; mainly ’cause I don’t own one. I’ve managed to have success with this deck without him.

Start with the stuff listed. Pull Madine and Solo from Reserve during your opponent’s turn. Start off like your standard Jedi Testing by getting Yoda at the Hut with his Hope on him first turn if you can. 2nd turn, get Madine to there with JT1 and then pull a scout. All the characters except for Willard and Tycho are scouts. Tycho and Willard are spies.
Madine should be protected on Dagobah and be a faithful apprentice by pulling a scout from reserve every turn.

Characters
   1x Arcona
Duh... scout and a great drain blocker. Watch our for the react cancellers.
   1x Chewbacca Of Kashyyyk
Great with General Solo. Use game text to pull Wuta.
   1x Colonel Cracken
Scout and a spy and a pilot. Incredible in Clouds with his ship.
   1x Commander Vanden Willard
Spy boy.
   1x Corporal Beezer
Anti-react and anti-SCrew
   1x Corporal Janse
Just a scout for this deck.
   1x Corporal Kensaric
Great game text. Deploy +2 really hurts
   1x Corporal Midge
Drain adder with Solo and DoS
   1x Daughter Of Skywalker
Powerful scout
   1x General Crix Madine
Your Jedi in training.
   1x General Solo
Use his game text as often as you can. It’s a killer.
   1x Lieutenant Blount
Spy, scout pilot. Matching ship in the deck as well.
   1x Lieutenant Greeve
Scout power 3
   1x Major Panno
Additional activation if you can
   1x Orrimaarko
Orri orri he’s our man!
   1x Sergeant Brooks Carlson
This guy makes the deck. Everybody moves for 1 force up to 2 sites away.
   1x Sergeant Junkin
Scout....
   1x Tycho Celchu
Spy and pilot with matching ship.
   1x Wuta
The only ’Wok. Get him with CoK text and then pull Endor sites if you can. He can even be pulled with Madine’s text.
   1x Yoda
Jedi Master

Devices
   1x Landing Claw
Claw a ship (there’s 5 of them) if needed to block a drain.

Effects
   1x Close Air Support*
If you can, go to the system they are at and occupy with Talas and this on the table. Add a power and a battle destiny.
   1x Honor Of The Jedi*
Get it if necessary for HDADTJ, et al.
   1x Insurrection*
Characters forfeit +2 and no Elis.
   1x Squadron Assignments*

   1x Wise Advice

   1x Yoda’s Hope
Jedi Testing +1
The Effects marked with an * can also be pulled by dumping Your Insight Serves You Well.

Interrupts
   2x Dash
The best part of this Interrupt is that Scouts move as a react for free.
   1x Help Me Obi-Wan Kenobi
React another Rebel to an adjacent site
   2x Insertion Planning
-3 to opponent’s battle destiny if scout at an exterior battleground. With Yoda at the hut, your characters are now pretty much immune less than 6.
   2x Take The Initiative
+1 for each Scout/Spy in a battle (up to +6) and useful with all your 2/2 characters when being attacked by Creatures.
   2x The Signal
Get another Effect and a recycleable 5.

Jedi Tests
   1x A Jedi’s Strength
   1x Domain Of Evil
   1x Great Warrior
Finish 1, and then 2, deploy 3 and it’s done right away. Now with Yoda at the hut, and Insertion planning, you are immune less than 7.
