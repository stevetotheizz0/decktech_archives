Strategy
edit Use ANSB to set up EBO quickly set up massive drains in space with X_wings

Use incom to make those x wings power +1 ability +1 2 force = 2 x-wings power 8 and a destiny

Use corporal marmor at the docking bay with firin morett to deploy an X-wing for free and retrieve a force.

All wings report in and Firgrin are there for retrieval.

General Rieekan is there incase your opponent tries to occupy 5 hoth sites

The senses are there mainly for canceling Monnock but also any other pesky interupt.

It could be worse cancels early force loss and later ground drains you can't stop or surprize assault.

Honor of the Jedi is a staple for most decks use it against Hunt down and court

Against a space deck load up Han and wedge in gold squadron 1 and play organized attalk of the x-wings and go to town.

using organized attack as a lost interupt is very simple since you can retrieve that force with the next turn With firgrin and the marmor morett combo.

Put luke on a ship to stop your destiny

try not to deploy haven on hoth as the incom engineer already helps your battle destiny.

There are many things in this deck i could change but i do not have the cards but i am open to suggestions.
