Strategy: '

With this deck, you have three ways of getting your abyssins out for free. Your aliens deploy -1 to the same locations as Jabba or Chall bekan, and when Scum and Villany isout, they go down -1 anywhere, With this cheap deployemnt, you should have no trouble amassing a powerful abyssin army ready to crush any light side foe who dares set foot on the ground keep your forces fairly consolidated, however, as the Rebels have many ways of exploiting your one ability characters and will exclude bounce or move them away myo must be kept secure and safe at teh audience chamber at all costss. His most dangerouse adversaries are obiwan kenobi, and master luke, so use none shall pass to keep them out use power of the hut right away to get ephant mon and he will keep lando with vibro ax and han with heavy blaster pistol from every paying a visit

Once myo and his abyssins control the grounds at tatooine you’ll see why jabba callls them my kind of scum
