Starting at 5 family honor means you can have a 6-Chi Double-chi unit on the board on the 2nd turn damn near every game That’s money The Otomo/SiS/Edicts is Phoenix-hate, but they’ll probably beat you anyway, ’cause they’re gay like that.


Enjoy '

Strategy: '

Mikio turn 2, churn fat PH guys for fast honor, duel duel duel Fetch events for quicker gold production, since like half your deck is fatties, and Otomo to deny the same fetching to your opponent. Card drawing is money, draw with the favor and topdeck every turn with Ginawa (unless an attack is necessary). Toshimoko sensei isn’t necessary since you’re double, they’re not.


Against Phoenix, keep that box unbowed. Otomo slows them to a crawl if you can make good use of it without slowing yourself down too much.
