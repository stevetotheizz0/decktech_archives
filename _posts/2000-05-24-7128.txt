Strategy: 

It won't make much sense to just read, but trust me, it works.  I
generally get Vader, 2 Cadets, DJP, Trooper Assault, and Tactical
Support by the third turn (usually by the second).  I put out one of my
big drain sites to give me extra force and to bait them into deploying
there.	As soon as they deploy *anything* to a site, I play Tactical
Support to get out the three Sergeants (if I don't have them already),
and commence beatdown!	Let's break down the total power:

Vader: 6
2 Cadets: 2 + 4 (TA) x 2 (DJP) = 12
Barich: 2 + 2 (TA) x2 (DJP) = 8
Elsek: 1 + 2 (TA) x2 (DJP) = 6
Wallen: 2 + 2 (TA) x2 (DJP) = 8
Hewex: 2 x 2 (DJP) + 5 (adds 1 for each Trooper) = 9

That's exactly 11 force to deploy, with a a grand total of 49 power!
Then, you get to use Barich's text to draw destiny and subtract from
their total power attrition.  And with such a high-destiny deck, you'll
probably end up subtracting at least 3.

Obvious weaknesses are against decks that don't ever plan on deploying on the ground, but I generally beat Hidden Base with this, and numbers decks are taken care of by getting Vesden out with Tactical Support.
