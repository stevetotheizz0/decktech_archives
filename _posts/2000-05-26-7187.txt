Strategy: '

Start with Any Methods Necessary and get Fett, Slave1, Fett's Blaster, And the CC Prison. You wont use the CC prison much except for a quick Icon.  The Dungeon is much better.  The Frustrations and Death Mark along with Court, should get your opponent to you then unleash your Creatures. And of course capture what you can with a bount on their head and retrive what little you'll lose. Pretty easy huh? '
