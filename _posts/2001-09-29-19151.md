Strategy: '

Yes, I did say this beat the Senate. How, I don’t know; it wasn’t my intention. Credit goes to Martin Warlicki for giving me the idea.


The deck runs on what I call the "Klutz’s Dance Of Death" principle. In other words, it’s all about Binks. First turn, get Jar Jar out and whoever else you can, probably as backup. I suggest deploying Jar Jar where opponent’s got a character wit hlow ability. Deploying starts the dance. Second step, battle that weak character and get rid of him. This works real well against Droidekas and has the bonus of annoyance. Let Jar Jar eat a bit whie you battle elsewhere if you feel like it, then use three to grab him into hand. Drop him onto the flipped Objective during opponent’s turn to cancel a drain or battle destiny then redeploy him next turn.


Suggested backup for our Gungan friend

Ben-your own, mobile bacta tank, forfeit and return for free, and get a swing in the process;

Daughter-one of the best Leia’s out there, give her her rifle and Merc Armor, she’s power seven and forces an instant loss of any character she hits;

Panaka-able to arm himself, add to total power and direct damage.


Other suggestions

Janse, A280, sniping-the only things in here specifically for Senate killing, get Janse to the docking bay and snipe away;

Eopie-extra battle destiyn and high race destiny;

Transmission Terminated-cancel those annoying holograms;

Projection Of A Skywalker-don’t even worry about the Senate drain, modify it;

Meditation-on Leia, killer(her rifle is now a +4 weapon and she adds an extra battle destiny).  '
