Strategy: '

update  ah I forgot to tell you, you have 75 % of the time your combo at end of turn 3.

and there is grapler to make sure only 1 monok get play. lost is useless so grab it only if your oponent is inteligent enough to play it used.

and for the super stupid out there. how are you gunna play wounded wokie or imp comand when you got a draw their fire and a frozen asset up your a$$ ?


david irvine is right. If Guri is there go make a fake attack with only luke.


AND for all your BUT WHAT IF ********* and ******* it never hapen  nobody play oota gota solo. if they play that, they are scrub, and I will beat scrub anyways... and if you fear that much operation as planed /ghyyk, play insurection, tat docking bay and begar instead of some @#$% like nabrun, witch is almost never used.


Ok, the strategy is simple, win the game in 1 big battle.


So all card in this deck are based to do that.  The strategy is the same against all deck except MKOS. witch I found a new strategy after the DCP. When I scrub out


against MKOS deploy all your sh1t in the desert. Nabrun leids all your character. If they ghyyk/suck it. Grab it. Then next turn( on once you have it), frozen asset & nabrun leids .  make sure you have I have a bad feeling to triple the damage


Control suck it because I play descent into the dark as I retrieve my force with draw their fire. Most dark side cant handle that deck. especially since most now are based to kill WYS.


grimtash was not in the deck originaly. but its huge, to get double... because the oponent will draw alot once he realise what you are doing. and see what the oponents hold


also against like ROPS DONt start One Tay  I read that in some report... its a shame. the oponent must not know you play with it


yannick invented the deck at world championship in 1999


Have fun
