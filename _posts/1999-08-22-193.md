Strategy: '

Straight out, this deck relys on playskill.. much like the old baragwin decks, it lets the opponent commit to drains, while it focuses on disruption and attempts to outdrain in the other theater and at the holotable while retreving with OTE/DTF.. the bacta keeps the EPPs cycling through, and ive got lots of anti manipulation (grabbers+shocks) to nail them, plus plenty of signal action to get out my effects.. You cant panick, but with some patient play youve got a chance against anything.. against hunt down, cancel visage with TT or a spy, and then go to town with drains in space at kessel, and at the holotable for 2 for a total of 5 and then stack 2 six destinies by tracking on top of your deck and let them go for the duel where you draw a 12.. against DS space, pick your battles, drain at the corridor and at the holotable, and draw the tracked 6s for destiny with EPPs to cause HUGE force loss from attrition for each battle.. ive outbattled DS IAO decks with this before with some careful battling.. its all about timing and playskill, and not about just laying your cards.. the deck doesnt play itself, but its flexible, and has all the bases covered..
