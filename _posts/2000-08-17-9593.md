Strategy: '

This deck is always interesting for you and your opponent. They aren&#8217;t prepared for Court Decks and most people won&#8217;t know what to expect.  You can start with Presence of the Force on the Dungeon to get those three battlegrounds out and cancel Honor of the Jedi.	You will also be activating a lot of force as well so getting those ships out shouldn&#8217;t be tough to do. Just deploy all over Tatooine and set up Scum and Villainy and Tatooine Occupation. If your opponent is playing hidden base you won&#8217;t last long in Space but you will be able to probe their system and then drain on the ground.  The best thing is your opponent doesn&#8217;t expect this and you&#8217;ll start off quick enough to really start hurting them.	Try not to flip your objective and if it happens feed stuff to the Sarlacc. Barrier any big stuff or keep them from getting that destiny until you can bring reinforcements.

Against Hidden Base  Wait for them to flip then probe Tatooine.  Sit there, initiate, retrieve ship, deploy ship and initiate again. Probe only systems you know aren&#8217;t the base so you&#8217;ll be able to battle there w/o the damage.  If you need to you can get rid of the objective so they can&#8217;t cancel your drains.

Profit HA Start Mara and Ephant Mon. That&#8217;s it they&#8217;re done. Especially if Han wanders to the pit of carkoon.

Mind What You Have Learned  Land and hurt them.

There is good in Him Kill Luke. Battle, Drain, Retrieve. Game over.
