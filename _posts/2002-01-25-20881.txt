There’s the deck....


..... .. . . and now here’s the strategy....

Strategy: '

Well, this is VERY similar to my first design of this deck {Kessel Hold}, so if you wish to read how it works even more so then I will list here, go check that out. Also, check out the tournament Report that goes with it {Lancaster 12/29/01}.

You begin using Mind What... to get a very good activating, and to slow down the opponent’s drains.

First turn On opponent’s turn. Pull Crix. Then, on your turn, pull either Yoda’s Hut {if you cannot activate enough to deploy both Yoda and Crix}, if you can deploy both, pull the Training Area. Then use the Area to get Jedi Test 1, then deploy Yoda/Crix using the Great Warrior text to deploy Crix. Then, also use Mind What to go get Luke’s Backpack, and deploy that. Have the Yodster’s ride Crix like he was a donkey.

This alone gives you a total plus 
3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7, Meaning you need a 6 {there is 2 Seven’s in the deck} on Two Destiny. So, it will probably be the second turn til you pull it off, when you pull the second site. 

After this, whenever opponent drains you, drop They Win This Round. It works WONDERS with Great Warrior. Great Warrior ignores all their drain bonuses, and TWTR gives them a +1 Drain {which is ignored}, and you a +1 Battle Destiny draw, plus whenever you control it, you retreive 4, then, the destiny 5 Immediate Effect goes on top of your used pile for nice easy tracking.

Wookie Strangle is in there for Ref. 3 Chewie, who is +11 to the destiny with it. Making him sound like a freaken Demon God from DnD. He goes Toe to Toe with the Emperor. If the opponent has no destiny, Chewie can freken choke little Emperor to death. Also, if you have the tracked 7 {Jar Jar’s Electrople}, you can easily get anyone, since this gives you an 18 total.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or questions, that you don’t feel like putting in the review section, D-mail it to me.
