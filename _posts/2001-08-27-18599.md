Strategy: '

Before you draw your starting hand pull Wakeelmui and then draw your hand. If your playing against something that will give you a turn or two to set up then deploy one of your imperials with the Spaceport Docking Bay to Raaltiir. Dont forget to depoy Wakeelmui for the extra activation and the later TIE loop. End your turn and draw up whatever is left.If you have one of the LINs thats even better, drop it and draw up for a mine to keep the site clear for the flip.


Get Tarkin and Vader to the Prefects Office and drain there. While theyre camped out they add to the power and forfiet of your other imperials at adjacent sites. Try to get at least one dark jedi with lightsaber at each site with bounty hunters and droids there to intimidate the opposition from wanting to go visit you. This should give you an excellent initial hold on the planet and allow you time to find any key elements needed to defeat a specific deck type or opponent.


Card Choices-


SpacePort sites- I looked long and hard at the other sites possible for this deck and decided that I liked the theme of the Spaceport sites best for the large amount of imperials I was going to deploy to them. Also they give the imperials an often needed boost in thier forfiet values.


LIN-V8M & Timer Mines- I thought intensely on this issue as well. Originally it was going to be more bounty hunters and Thermal Detonators, but I only own one Thermal Detonator. So I went with the next best thing, a weapon the light side would want to avoid at all costs.


Mauls Electrobinoculars- They could probly just be taken out, but I still find them way too useful to stack destiny with in a tight spot. This one card has saved me a crucial battle and even the game on more than one occasion.


Many other of the odd choices are for the most part due to meta-game choices. If you have any questions please feel free to d-mail me, Id be glad to here from anyone constructive.


Matchups-


Plead My Case- The Jedi Council style one can be pretty tough, but it takes them a little too long to be able to finally get to you before they can hamper you. By then you have your space going for you and are draining them away fast. Want more fun than that? Drop the bombs with Mara to the chamber and watch them scramble for cover.


Profit- The direct damage can be bothersome until you start draining heavily yourself. Any battle in space and you own them, even Home One loaded to the gills with pilots. There isnt a single pilot save for Horn and Luke that can meet his ability killing requirements in space. And if that isnt enough, Lateral Damage then battle. Whats more just drop your ”bombs” to a few of there sites and watch them lose there direct damage as well.


Watch Your Step- Maul alone kills this deck. And Maul in his ship nukes Celebration. While you drain away at his Cantina make sure to kill everything that comes up against you. Or deploy your bombs to force them to move to a huge beat down. All in all this deck should be easy to handle.


Hidden Base- This will be a fun game. Maul to probe and place thier objective out of play and the rest of the fleet to bring the pain. All your drains on the ground are just icing on the cake.


Mind What You Have Learned- Test 1 or not you will drain them to death. The Sienar retreival could prove to be esential if they play numbers against you. Other than that this shouldnt be too hard. If you have to take Maul to Dagobah and kill Luke and Yoda just do so. Remember, Mauls ship can take both Vader and himself there to adminster the final lesson.


Hyperdrive Generator- This deck will never give you a problem early on, but it will kick the crap out of you if you let it on Tatooine. Block there drains, But WIN the battles. If you dont it WILL get too messy to deal with. The flip is when the objective will start to get particularly mean.


There Is Good In Him- The scouts type can be a royal pain to deal with. Remeber to keep killing them and get Maul down to control the flees as quickly as you can. Flip but do so cautiously. Theyre probly holding a huge beat down in there hand. If you can get Luke off the table with Maul, that way you can have easy access to Madine and Solo who cause some of the more serious problems for you via Capitol Support.


Rescue The Princess- Dont let them have Leia Kill her as fast as you can. Just get her off the table. Then drain heavily and battle them everywhere you can. Maximize there damage in every way


Quiet Mining Colony- The key here is to keep them from flipping while causing maximum damage with drains and battle. The bomb droids will work very well toward keeping them from flipping or just taking them out entirely. Mauls Electrobinoculars can find just the right destiny number to do so. Your space fleet should concentrate on controling Bespin as well. No Bespin and no Cloud City Occupation to have to deal with.


Well, please give it a try and rate it fairly. Thats all I ever ask. Thanks.  '
