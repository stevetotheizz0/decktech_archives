Strategy: '

Like I said before I made this deck because I wanted to play a deck that didn't care about what the dark side was playing. Basically you train to test 2 and drain on Cloud City.  You can set up a shell on Cloud City and when (if) they deploy thier you beat them up.  Hunt Down can be beat by cancel Visage and running from Vader with Path and Lift Tubes.  To beat Ralltiir... don't let them flip.  This can be done with Tantive and your aliens.  Yoda can reduce the attrition by 2 so you don't have to lost stuff with battle destiny being so low in the ROPS decks.  The jedi testing and projections should take care of the ground drains you can't stop otherwise.  Jedi Training to test 1 won't be a problem against Endor Ops with the help of Wise Advice and At Peace.  Operatives... set up Batte Plan.  '
