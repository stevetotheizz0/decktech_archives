Strategy: '

Well, like I said, it's a common decktype nowadays, but please do not rate it low just because of its 'unoriginality.' The deck is a machine, once it is flipped, there is almost no stopping it.

Setup to flip on Ralltiir with your walkers and pilots (should take maybe 4-5 turns) and then go to where your opponent is. With the addition to battle destiny, the drain -1, and the ability to get any card from your deck during your control phase, you can pretty much hold your own no matter what your opponent is playing, provided you are skilled enough to know how to handle RalOps correctly.

I would put in a strategy section, but
a) I don't go to many tournies, so I am not aware of RalOps' chances vs. different decktypes
b) Most of you should already know how to play RalOps by now )

Thanks for looking,
Andy '
