Strategy: '

Ok looks pretty standard.  Pull your systems drain and send jedi to control one site (preferably your docking bay).  Use Mirrax to set up destiny,  especially if you have matching ship/pilot in hand (send one back to squassin for it later).  You pretty much own space but not completely so save your hyper escapes if something really bad comes around.  On to card choices.

Two Lukes? 
yes.  hes the most versitle character in this deck IMHO.  With a few manuevers, darklighter spin, and out of nowhere he can single handedly take out the executer (so long as you don’t draw a destiny of one).  or you could put either version with Ben to play Gift of the mentor.  either version can use Anakins stick.

Boushh?  
Undercover spy and a skywalker.  if she needs to she can break cover and use Anakins stick.  and if a hit squad comes after her just Jedi’s resilinse to bring her back to spy some more.

Jek?  
his ship is an x-wing to use the guns and also a six destiny.  He’s a red Squad pilot for use with wedge. Plus he draws on his own.  

Btw, Corran on red 5 can do the same thing as luke if hes got prior engagements elsewhere.

Anyway let me know what you think.  D-mail me with any questions.
