I went 2/2 with this deck It has great battle potential and the fact that you can grab matching pilots to make your stuff Immune to Attrition is SWEET!!!! Lord Vader is cool...it'd be better w/a Lightsaber but hey that's just me.... enjoy and thanks for reading....and again please don't rate this deck poorly because it's a Pre-Release deck....and for the vitals...check ot the TR Mt.View CA 062400 for more in depth stuff.

Thanks
