Strategy: 

this deck is the bomb. it has so much power and junk. i don't knwo what to say in the strategy.... hmmmm... it's kinda like a trm deck except it packs a mini-visage. and gives me forfiet and ships, the benifiets are great. first of all though, i shall say what do you do agaisnt certian decks

agsinst ops: try to win this one using scum if you get it. this was you you can retrive and stuff and that's cool. you also have abc and batle order(which you start with) make sure to leave one guy at tatioone to not lose from the objective. you can win this with style.

agasinst trm: just batle them out. you won't be choked cause whenever i play this you get plenty of locatoins. because of this you can out batle them and out sac them, i played agsint my bro's and beat his handily cause this deck is strong.

agsint ebo: this is the only weakness of the deck. i think some more ships would help batle this deck. so if this is big put in more ships and with cout damage  and mara with her saber in space. if you can fight it in space you'll win.

agsint blow up the big ping pong ball: so they blow up the dath star. so they get some good drains. but then what? you'll batle them on the ground and beat them and drain on yavin. also court damage and s&D will hurt them. by the time the'll be set up the'll be really hurting. this matchup is yours to win.

agsint profit: so you pull your stough out and what not and you will let them free han so then you go smack them. your sac will go through,  just like trm you will out batle them, plus you will have a huge force aadvatage casue this deck whenever i played with it get's it's locations. 1 cc engineer may be added so you can force choke them-kinda.

what else is there? i say bring it on this deck can take it. as for the title, i hope you all like queen! cause the's dynamite with a laser beeam, guranteed to blow your mind!
