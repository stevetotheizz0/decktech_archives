Strategy: 

The idea of the deck is the same.  I DON’T need space, regardless of whatever one says.  I drain for an average of like 6 to 9 on turn 2 or 3.  I will repeat this...NO SPACE!  I put in Uncontrollabe for Vader, because it’s still useful.  The other main difference is the addition of Staging Areas, since I grab the docking bays on turn 1 & 2.  If you have nay questions, mail me before you review this badly.
