Strategy: '

LOCATIONSBy only using 4 Dagobah sites I can get where I need to quicker. The Rendevous
point is in there simply for activation, or a cheap place to dump ships then move them. Kessel is
a late game drainer if they're on ground, vice-versa for Lower Corridor.

CHARACTERSYoda and Daughter are the best way to test (duh). The EPP crew is a goo source of beatdown
and hit-run to slow my opponent. The 2/2 rebels are in there for foreiet fodder, and for retrieval with
Noble Sacrifice, and they get the bonuse from Insurrection. Threepio is just good, especially when Yoda
is at the hut. I use Tawss instead of Orrimaarko in case of Manipulator or Rallops, and she is grea against
court.

INTERRUPTS Except for 6 of them, every interrupt in the deck is a recycble high destiny wiht other uses.
Bith Shuffle messes up tracking, Out of Commision is great against any deck that loses force, Shocking
info. kills Manipulator, Signal is very versatile, and Throw me another Charge counters troopers. The rest
are for Huntdown, except for Noble S. which are in there to keep alive until I flip, and in case I have
forfiet fodder/EPP and a clash is coming, in most cases I have the oppurtunity to kill off the 2/2 guy.

EFFECTS Slow down the opponent and keep me alive is what my effects try to do. By starting Wise Advice
I train faster and my grabbers come out for free, great. DTF and Tanl give me some staying power with
EPP's and help me keep my deck up for when I flip. Aim High and Battle slow my opponent down, very important
in a testing deck. Insurrection boosts me up for Noble S. and it prevents some nasty Elsi beatdown.

STARSHIPS Basically the 5 best LS ships (minus premire Falcon). They can deliver some hurt, blcok drains,
and then drain at Kessel should I need it.

The only deck I have problems with is Rallops, if anyone has some ideas on how to improve my chance against
it, please let me know. '
