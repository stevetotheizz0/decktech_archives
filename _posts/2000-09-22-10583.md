Strategy: '

There was an error in my decklist...add 1 Chall Bekan, and 1 Myo

This deck is my first try at a My Kind of Scum deck. I decided to go with heavy abyssins, and a nice mighty jabba/bib/boelo theme.

Power of the Hutt is VERY important.It pulls EVERYTHING. It’ll grab your nasties, and speed the deck up immensely.

How to start the game

On Turn 1, grab rendili before you activate,pull the audience chamber, and DB 94. Then, grab a jabba’s sail barge, and put it down with your 5 force, and pull the passenger deck.

On Turn two, your activation is rather healthy, at 10+whatever your oponent gives you.

Continue the game by using beatdown w/ abyssins, and use bib/jabba to add 2 to your destinies, and boelo to protect them from attrition.

Mara, Fett, and Iggy can be used for beatdown, or whatever other uses you find for them.

Card notes
Wounded Wookiee- this card is great destiny 5 when flipped, and it allows you to cancel a rebel’s game text at the same site as an abyssin. Cancelling clash isn’t bad either...

Search and Destroy With honor practically biting it, this card will become more powerful, as most people will cease using honor.


Any suggestions would be nice, also for info on the new cards, go to
