Strategy: '

This deck runs like any other MKOS deck; you stock up in the chamber and get scum going. You go beat up on the light side and retrieve a lot of force. The cool part of this deck is in the ROC and MAIN combo. You get a good amount of force, and you can check your deck with crush every turn, so you know if your combo cards are in your force pile.

The one problem this deck has is light side killing their guys with on the edge. You put ROC on a guy and they just go and kill him off. ROC is a utility card. Don’t forget you can put it on 2 ability rebels and alien leaders (Like ecc lando). They can’t play on the edge on ability two rebels or aliens, so your ROC MAIN combo stays around. 

I’d give you a more explicate strategy but I’ve only played the deck in one tourney and I am sure that TAT will change how this deck is played. This is the last week of playing fun wacky decks, so try new stuff out I am looking forward to see what people think of this deck, and how they would change it. 

Thanks,
