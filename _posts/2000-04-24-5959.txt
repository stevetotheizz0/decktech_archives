Strategy: 

This deck is very solid. It works against most LS Deck Types. I need to work in a Broken for Test 2 decks. Other than that just battle and drain. Try and drop a Vader or Mara with saber to the 3rd Marker as soon as you can. Add a presense and it is a 4 drain. They either come to you to battle or they lose.
Let me know what you think.
