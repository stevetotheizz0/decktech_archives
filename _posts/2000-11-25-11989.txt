Strategy: 

The cards speak for themselves.  This deck has lost once out of 5 games.  It lost to a Training deck but it was still a close Game.  I am thinking about takin out 1 Palpatine or Dengar In Punishing One for a Secret Plans to counteract JPSD Objective, Profit and Training.  I don’t want to take out a Palpitine unless I have to because I love draw Mains for destiny 6 w/o destiny manipulation.  Hardly any of the starships die unless they are playing EPP beatdown.  I am your Father rocks.  If they they throw down any Luke other than Jedi Luke, they lose 4 force to a duel when Vader wins (3 to the objective, 1 to the effect).	In case people are playing Jedi Luke I can dropback I am Your Father back into my deck as a destiny 6. With no escape (I am thinking about substituting for Mob. Points and Sacing out YCHF) they have to eat force loss.  I can also spread out and draing to force battles.
