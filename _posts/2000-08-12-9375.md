Strategy
You always start with MP and IAO. Depending on what you opponnent plays you'll take one of the following cards below as 3th starting effect.

 -EBO -> Imperial Decree;
 -Profit -> Secret Plans;
 -Hidden Base -> You Cannot Hide Forever (1st turn Security
  Precations);
 -There's Good In Him -> Empire's New Order.

Before you active you'll take Wakeelmui out of your deck, active force, get out a docking bay (prefered Executor DB) and deploy a character at it. Deploy a site at Ralltiir. Also put Wakeelmui on table and on your 2nd turn you'll active 8 force.

After this it's just a basic setup. Try to flip ASAP and don't forget to drain.

These cards are in this deck for

Point Man -> for Scramble;
Masterful Move -> for Mantellian Sarvip;
Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down -> for Bacta Tank.

Any suggestion on making this deck better/stronger will be nice to hear for you.

 -Enjoy.

PS I know it's not original. Lots of people have build
    this and I don't care. This is just my way of building
    one.
