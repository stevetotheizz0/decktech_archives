Strategy: '

This deck is fresh off the drawing board (the Deckmaker program) and hasnt been tested. Again i found a ton of Black Sun Agent able characters and most bounty hunters haver their ship. (and are piloting them e.g. Boba Fett in Slave 1) I put in the necessities like Xizor, Guri, Vigo, Stinger, Virago stuff like that. I am not expecting this deck to be great the first time around. can you people out there tr y to give me some constructive reviews but if you want to give me alot of help D-Mail it to me. 


Start the objective with the locations and Xizor

it shouldnt be too hard to get other locations and crap out. By the way if you were wondering i cant pack any imp stuff (except the walkers) cause of the objective.


You should have enough Force to deploy everything. Use the Walkers for ground defense (mostly of Coruscant) And the bounty hunters and their ships to defend space. 


There are a TON of bounty hunters in there for a reason. Use them for space (the main ones e.g. Boba, Bossk)and use the other ones (e.g. Djas Puhr) to help a little on the ground.


That is it
