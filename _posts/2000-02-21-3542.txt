Objective(1)
This Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time/Pray I Don't Alter It Any Further 

Strategy: 

CRUD!! There's something messed up with the deck poster. There isn't an Abyssin Ornament, and there's only 5 Ugs. Vader's Lightsaber and Mara's Lightsaber are in. The Casino is West Gallery. Alright. I'll start off by describing a main thing: character deployment across CC.

Using Carbon Chamber as your starter, deploy Darth(with saber), Mara(with saber), and Tarkin there(and and Ugn. for good measure). If your opponent battles u there, u can play Jedi Prescence, and kick their butt. Play All Too Easy on whomever u hit, and opponent loses 8 force.

Having 2 Downtown Plazas in, I deploy Jabba, Fett, 4-LOM and an imperial there(and and Ug. for good measure), and u have another locked down site.

Deploy the rest of the characters to Port Town District/West Gallery. Being the weakest site, u might need to send Mara, 4-Lom, or Boba for protection.

The interrupts are self-explanatory: they provide protection against undercover spies, an attempt to cancel DD, oh, and the starter.

Ditto for the effects.

Using the objective, u should be able to get DD deployed FAIRLY early, meanwhile u could work with Occupation to keep your opponent OCCUPIED(:]).

I know a main problem with the deck would be destiny, but with the Ugs, i should be ok, considering i flip the Obj.

Oh, and the starting stuff is: AMN, Boba, ECC Obj., Secret Plans, and Carbon Chamber.
