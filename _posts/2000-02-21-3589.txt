Objective:
Endor Operations/Imperial Outpost  

Strategy: 

vs. Profit
Start PotF or Security Precautions and you have 8 force to use Miiyoom first turn!  Easy win here.

vs Hidden Base
Start Security Precautions.  Drain and beat the hell out of them.  You should be able to push them around... the bounty hunter ships help this too.

vs Dagobah
Land on Dagobah.  Beat the crap out of them.  Make sure you can kill/capture Luke so he cant use the Jedi Test crap... then drain like hell in space.

vs anything else
Use your brain to play.  Adapt to their style of play and do whatever you think would hurt them most.  I usually start Oppressive Enforcement against anything else.

- No numbers protection because I never ever ever see it here.	The last time I've seen anyone use that card was probably pre-regionals last year.  If youre nervous about it you can add a Resistance.  You can occupy 3 BGs fairly quickly.

THis deck is 5-0 so far... I like it alot.
