We're In Attack Position Now

Strategy: 

Well, I've played against enough, so its my turn to give my thoughts on ROPs....

Simply put, this deck provides you with great flexibility and devistating power through force drains, battles, and force loss.	I put enough thought into this deck to counter most light side decks, all though there are still a few kinks to go.  The basic idea of the deck is to get out, play reckless, and start breaking down your opponent from the very beginning.  Second turn flips are VERY common, even with little force generation.  Biker Scouts on bikes, even pilots on bikes... you only need 1 to hold a site, react with them to battles... Ralltiir is a haven for your forces.

HB:  Well, now that it is pretty much dead, or at least well on its way... let's give it another push.  Search and Destroy hurts a good bit, plus force drain -1 on the second turn... its not too particularly harmful until the light side flips... then he's in trouble.  The ground is yours, probably won't even fight for it.	And if he spies you, screw him... Relentless Tracking will make him think better next game.  Hold down Ralltiir, put ALL your efforts into it, let him feel the power of We're In Attack Position Now (he can't cancel that force loss :) ).	You may want to go out and get the necklace from Y4, Emperor may want to oversee things, drain him to death fast.  That's as simple as it is.

EBO: Its too slow, handle it like HB... force loss it to death, choose your battles wisely, and let him have the ice planet.  Though grin when he puts someone down on the 4th marker and show him next turn why the loss of 1 was better to take.

TISGIM: Turning Vader?	Nonsense, he has to WIN battles first... and most Ralltiir Ops decks are proficient at battling.  Don't get crazy... Relentless Tracking Luke and then watch how fast he runs towards that Biker Scout party on the landing platform (Vader is useful too).  Note: Relentless Tracking Luke BEFORE you capture him, otherwise you can't!  Don't underestimate the light side, cover your rear end.  Once again, Commander/General Occupation and speedy flips/drains are your friends.

Training:  Search and Destroy!	Make Luke pay for learning, education is not free.  You also have time, but ditch the necklace and overseeing it personally, they're useless.	Force Loss and a lot of quick force drains are going to be your victory against training.  Shouldn't be too difficult of a match.  Remeber to Relentless Tracking those undercover spies... make them pay for blocking a force drain of 1.

RST:  You have speed over them, use it to your advantage (though Search and Destroy is useless other than Biker Scouts are +1 forfeit, hehe).

Power:	Hold on to your boxers here.  Expand the Spaceport Perfect's Office... cover your rear end.  Pleanty of leaders for that +1 power/+1 forfeit... easily can have a 6 Power, 9 forfeit Ozzel, 7 Power Renz, 10 Power Vader!  Make your opponent think twice before coming down... and use your match ups!  Igar+Tempest 1, General+Imperial command, Barich+Biker Scouts, Elsek (Ghhhk as a character!), react react react!  Have fun!

Its impossible to tell you exactly everything about the deck, just modify it, have fun with it, and find out all the tricks and tactics yourself.  Until next time, when I MAY post a light deck, hehe.
