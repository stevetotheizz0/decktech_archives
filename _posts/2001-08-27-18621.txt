Strategy: 

Basicly pull watto out of reserve deck first turn deploy character to mos espa, flip objective, first turn make light side lose to force. All most all of the interrupts are used so they get recycled back into the deck. Use vader’s anger to add  one to your weapon draws. Its fun when maul or vader or jade comes out for free. If they don’t have any force then they lose two. Use the Esablish Control to add force drain. the droids are in there for their blasters. I couldn’t pass up destiny six blasters. I haven’t had time to play it in tourney, just play test against friends and it did good. please review and leave feedback so i can improve the deck. and i only have one maul and 2 watto’s 
UPDATE 1:
Once I do get some more watto’s they are going into the deck you need at least 3 or 4 watto’s for the deck to work
