Strategy: '

Regular  x-wing beatdown.  Use spies and POAS to stop the Drains. If they come to space, usually they will get killed, unless they deploy all their starships to the same location but then you can outdrain them.

vs. Space.
Should do well against it.  I playtested this deck and it got beat by it.

vs. Huntdown.
Get spies to their sites and cancel visage.  Use x-wings for beatdown.

vs. Raltiir.
This might be trouble but you should be able to grab alter and cancel all of the drains.  Outdrain and rebel barrier their starships.  Use the cannons to kill their bounty hunters.

vs.  Ground
Same as the raltiir.
