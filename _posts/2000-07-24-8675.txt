Strategy: 

Basic Strategy:	Get the War Room first.  Get gunners there ASAP.  Put Ozzel or Evax at the Conference Room ASAP.  IAO is to stop Nabrun beatdowns and add some forfiet fodder.	Oppressive Enforcement is to help with destiny and SAC.  Blow up Alderaan or the opponents planet.  If theyre still alive, drain.

vs. Throne Room Mains: Blow up Yavin 4 :-)
vs. LS Anti-Death Star Objective:  Use the Death Star Assault Squadron against their Attack Runs.  Blow up Y4.	Good matchup.
vs. EBO:  Another good matchup.  Blow up Hoth while using your space fleet to hold back their ships.
vs. Ops:  Blow up the Subjugated Planet.  Use your ground forces to kill some operatives in the meantime.
vs. MWYHL:  Blow up Alderaan, then drain the heck out of them.
vs. Profit: Start Mara and Zuckuss.  Reinforce ASAP.  Blow up Alderaan and drain.
vs. Odds:  Odds are dead because of the new effects.  Why waste a card space on a dead deck?
vs. New LS Objective: Havent seen it played in my area yet.
vs. Anything Else: Blow up planet if possible.	If not, blow up Alderaan and drain.

Specific Cards:
-Its Worse:  I once beat a Death Star deck by absorbing 14 damage when he blew up my Hoth.  Never want to fall to that.
-4 Characters can draw destiny by themselves.
-Lift Tubes are for shuttling people around on the Death Star and destiny.
-Speaking of destiny, I have 4 destiny 6s.  All the 0s will be out of my deck by the end of the game, except for maybe Ozzel.
-Lots of ability 2 star destroyers and pilots
-The Admirals Order allows me to pretty much sit a SD and pilot at a system and survive.
-I use the ability 3 pilots
-I have Sense and Alter in here to cancel opponents major interrupts and effects.
-Captain Godherdt rules!!!

Thats all for now.  Remember to tell me what to take out, as well as what to put in.
Thanx!
