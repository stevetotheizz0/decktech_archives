Strategy: '

Well this is the first deck I’ve built in about 7 months and I really haven’t played in forever so I don’t have any idea how the matchups really work out, just ideas about how they should work out.


I’d Really like to get a Sidious in here, but I haven’t bought much R3 and absolutly no Theed so I don’t have 1.


Start off by pulling out Carida and the DBs.  Flip early, first or 2nd turn if possible.  After that take the fight to them.


Deck Matchups


vs. Watch Your Step

When Luke hits the table either duel him with Vader or Mara or kill/capture him with Maul or Iggy.  If you plan on going into space make sure you have Guri to limit their draws.  On the ground use Tatooin Maul to ignore the little guys.  If you can get rid of some of the smugglers with Dr. E and Ponda B and Control/SFS


vs. Senate

Set up the same, they will probably try to kill Vader with suicide EPPs, if possible duel them off, if not use the Grabber shield for Resilliance.  You won’t be able to do anything about the Senate so just try and work around that.  If possible get control of Carida and get the Battle Plan shield out.


vs. Saber Combat

This should be a really fun matchup.  Just try to duel their guys and take control of the Theed Sites.  Sidious would really help here.


vs. others

I think those are the 3 most popular light decks right now against others just play it smart and you should win.


Helpful comments would be greatly apprecitated.


Thanks
