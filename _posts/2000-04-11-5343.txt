Strategy: 

 OK, here goes. You're likely to get a vader in first hand, but if not, all I can say is draw. This deck lives on ability... If you can't get it on table, you might as well forfeit. There are plenty of aliens to counter ops, and a few good starships to keep the spacelane clear. If your opponent is playing Hidden Base, be wary of deploying to space. Eject! Eject! is becoming very popular to counter Bounty Ships. The Tatooine locations have drain potential, so exploit them. There are a lot of interrupts, so playing this deck correctly requires some practice. Use AC to get Mara out with her saber, keep Vader on Tatooine if you can, and drain the heck out of them. My favorite setup is Vader and saber at Jundland wastes, Mosep and a couple of enforcers at Lar's farm, Mara and Saber at Cantina. That is a total of 8 force drain per turn, all must come from reserve deck. This is a good lure if you're the direct damage type. All the rest is up to you, but have fun and May the Force Be With You.
