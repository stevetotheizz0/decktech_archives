Strategy: '

1st turn grab Dagobah and the Hut for activation of AT LEAST 7 by the second turn. Pull out bespin, drop sites as you draw them then drain en mass with Pucimer and sabers. There is major beatdown power in the deck. Against Ops start Battle Order against everything else start wise advice. Against Hunt Down youve got Glancing Blows and Bothan Spies you can out drain ops and battle order will slow them. Against ISB battle them to death and retrieve retrieve retrieve with CCC. This deck just keeps regenrating and you shouldnt have any problems holding Bespin with all the x-wing power and the organized attacks.'
