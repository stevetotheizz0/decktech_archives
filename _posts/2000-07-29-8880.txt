Strategy: 

This is a fairly straightforward deck, which aims to flip the objective and out-drain or out-battle the opponent. I haven't actually gotten to play this deck yet, so I wanted to see how people think I should modify it. I have designed it to be a well-balanced deck, capable of draining on the ground or in space. I know that I could start with Prepared Defenses and several effects, but in my opinion it's more important to get Broken Concentration or Perimeter Patrol out immediately. Perimeter Patrol allows me to spread out without fear of a beatdown, and is a healthy deterrent to keep the LS off of Endor. Overseeing it Personally can help in my ground drains. I also plan to get Imperial Arrest Order out as fast as possible; hence, three Advisors. Now, I'm not sure how this deck will do; if you review it, please give me reasons for your suggestions, or point out anything obvious that I missed (it happens sometimes.) I really appreciate people's input. Thanks.
