Strategy: 

                 the goal of this deck is to set up relatively quickly start garrosining, occupationing and make my opponent lose alot of force. first turn i search garrosin 3rd marker and db and draw. if i have an imperial command i search piet who searches
  merrejk who searches hoth. on my early turns my
  goal is to set up suitable ground defense, ice
  storm and battle deployment help. once decree
      is in effect opponents force drains arenÕt a huge. Prepare for surface attack helps set up. mid game i deploy a sturdy fleet and deal out occupation, weÕre in attack position now and OIP. this can devestate light side even if they have menace fades. if manace fades is  really bugging me i can attack them with my fleet. if they attack a no prescese site with spies i will trample them, even though my destiny doesnÕt look good i get good race and trample destinies. This deck plays most deckÕs simularily and will do sudden hit and run on space or ground if nescessary. On combat decks I wont deploy my djedi 2 hoth instead I will attack.
