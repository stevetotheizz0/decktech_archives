Strategy: 

  I now your your probaly wondering why i start off with the 3-5 marker stuff well it is because i like to have lots of cards in my deck picture this you start of with the huntdown dueling stuff you have like 9 cards out of your deck. Now you draw your hand and you got 17 cards out of your deck then you start serching for stuff lets say you get carida and a docking bay thats means you have 19 cards out of your deck witch means you only have 41 cards in your deck. Now im not saying that the cards you pull out are not going to help you but i like having 50 cards in my deck to begin with. Now it also has its draw backs like you cant search for locations to get force that means you have to get them in your hand and it also might leave some 0 destinys in your deck but that can be Illiminated by some Tracking of the goodd destinys in the deck. Another major advantage of this deck is its ability to drain for massive amounts of force when it gets going. When it is all set up you can normaly drain for as much as 10 a turn not many decks can take that so they are forced to come battle you so now they are playing right into your hands. You can keep up with just about any ground mains deck. If they are playing lots of ground it probaly means they are weak in space so you set up in space and drain for as much as 7 plus if you get one of the precece of the force out to enhance your drains.	If they are playing space Drain on the ground and beat them up in space beleive me this deck can go up against anything in space especialy with the admirals order out that makes my capitals immune less then 4 less then 6 in the Chimaeras case.
If they are devoted to either space or ground use Battle Order to make them pay for there drains.

I like this deck alot cause it adepts so well to what the opponet is playing. Its just a all round solid deck. Here are some cards i would put in if i could find room or if i had them.

Empore Palpatin [Dont Have]

Executor [Dont Have]

Security Precations [Cant find room]

Another Imperial Command [Dont Have]

More Sac [Cant find room]

Ghhhk to prevent lucky beatdowns of 19 from twigg!!!!! [dont have room]

MATCHUPS

Against anything main.
Go ahead with the regular stuff when they come to battle you beat them up. drain for tons in space. you should win.

Against Hidden Base. Drain For tons on the ground when they put undercover spies to block them use hutt smooch and sniper to get riid of them. Wait till they flip then deploy your ships and prone the hidden base after you probe it just completely destroy them in space. If Hidden Base is Realy popular in your area play securtiy precations.

Against EBO
Go to hoth and try to prevent EBO from ever comming into effect but that probaly wont work so just drain at the echo sites and battle him in space when you get decree set up he wont be doing much of anything to you so just keep it in effect and you should win.

Against Anything else
Go with your normal strategy of draining and battling and you should win.
