Strategy: '

USe the Objective to get Yoda at his hut, to subtact 2 from attrition. It also adds 4 to sense and alter. You also arent giving the opponet any force. Use Inserection to search for the docking bays where you get lots of activation. Go to whatever planet they are on and Beatdown. Use the Suprise assults, you have good destiny and can make them lose big if they have alot of guys. '
