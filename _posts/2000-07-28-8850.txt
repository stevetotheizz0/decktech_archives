Strategy: 

This deck focuses mainly on draining on Endor.  It uses Endor Occ to activate more force for every Endor battleground you occupy to help get the big guns like Blizzard 2, Tempest 1, and Lord Vader down.
A normal start for this deck Preped Defences, Combat Response, Imperial Decree, and Secret Plans.

If you're against...
EBO:Keep draining on Endor and keep your space together.  One of the last things you want to do is go to Hoth.	If he uses T-47 Battle Formation you're gonna have to go after him on Hoth, but you'll probably beat his ground.  If you do go to Hoth keep your ground together.
HB:Drain on Endor and get a fast flip.	Keep your space together and make him flip his objective.  SP is not needed in this deck cause HB doesn't flip that often because they're afraid of SP.
Massassi Base Ops:Get to Yavin 4 quickly.  Leave just a few guys on Endor to drain and send some sort of strike team to Yavin 4.  Most Massassi Base decks want fast flips but don't let him get one.	Use the weapons to take out Obi amd some EPP's.  If he can get his objective flipped convert his Death Star so you don't have to lose +8 force if it blows.
RTP:Kill Leia at all costs!  Nothing else needed to say.
Profit:Start with Jade and Iggy at the Audience Chamber and send them reinforcements asap.
QMC:Make sure they can't get it flipped.
MWYHL:Just keep draining on Endor.
Ops:Start Leave Them To Me and kill some Ops.
#s:Put Vesden at the Back Door and keep him there.
Strike Team:This will be really fun, their base is on Endor, so is yours, you use Walkers, they use people, they'll lose no prob.
Good in Him:Keep Vader away from Luke and don't lose battles.
