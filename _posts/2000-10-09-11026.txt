Strategy: '

Start using Combat Readiness to get out the Dark Forest and the Forest Clearing. You will probably get at least two scouts in your starting hand. Deploy them with Bikes if possible and start draining for four on your second turn. Get out traffic control early to keep cycling those interrupts. Be careful to take into account the opponent having Corporal Beezer or another card to cancel reacts in their hand. Always keep a High Speed Tactics in your hand when you spread out your forces. Although one Biker Scout my not seem scary, he will soon be drawing a destiny by himself, and the longer the game goes on, the higher the destinys’ you’ll be drawing. Once you have Endor controled expand to opponents sites. Save your starships in your hand as a suprise. If your opponent isn’t playing numbers use the 3720 To 1. If they drop undercover spies, play relentless tracking. Save those controls and use them wisely. Happy Playing '
