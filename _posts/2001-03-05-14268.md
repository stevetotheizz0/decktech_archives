Strategy


Ok this deck is just an idea that I thought of.  First turn throw Pull Home 1 Db and toss crix there.  Use him to pull Geezum (scout).  Next turn (hopefully) drop Ben or luke with geezum, pull Tosche Station and deploy them there.  If you can control it Pull the Tat. DB, otherwise draw for more characters and wait.  3rd turn pull beezer and then Obi&#8217;s journal deploy on your big gun .Then continue to pull sites so that they are all out.  Take over the DB&#8217;s with fallen portals, and the Cantina with Luke or ben or both and sabers with obi&#8217;s journal and have yourself a nice big drain.  


Matchups

Ops.  Hahahahaha, deploy your non-unique DB and have fun.


Odds. (getting more common in MN) pray I would like to fit in an anti-odds card, but haven&#8217;t found space.  If you get a good draw you have characters who can take odds (dash, mirax, talon, Wedge and Sarg. D are all destiny 3 or more)


Hunt down Dueling.  A tough matchup.  Use obi and Luke as suicide mains, and try to control DB&#8217;s with fallen portals.  Need to fit in 2x ooc/tt


Scum Control the AC at all costs.  You should be able to take them in battle, so just bring it.


Anything else, do as the strategy section tells you.


I have never played this deck (am going home after work to build and test) any constructive criticism would be helpful.  I would like to add 2x OOC/TT, but not sure what to pull.  Suggestions would be helpful.
