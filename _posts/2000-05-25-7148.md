Strategy: '

This is a solid deck and just totally destroys tie swarm and Rallops.

AGAINST

RALLOPS Start Insurrection if they don't start IAO, otherwise, no effect. This matchup is all you. You should be able to flip early so
your opponent can't make your drains -1, or use Decree, or use ABTTU. All the sites are interior so they can't drop vehicles on you, and
savrip will help is space. Get Pucumir+Celebration and you will win every time.

HUNTDOWN Start Goo Nee Tay so there is no first turn Vader. The last you should deploy is the North Corridor as it is the only place
they can drain for two. Draw for Bothans or Nar Shadda so you can cancel Visage, then flip. Don't deploy Obi-Wan to Vader as he has
no duel protection. Get SOS out and keep RLR handy to cancel duel, and to get Luke kickin ass in battle. (Path also helps)

COURT Start Insurrection so they can't use capturing effectively. Get a Bothan down undercover to satisfy the Obj. (Or use Hit+Run Obi).
The last thing to deploy with your Obj. is the sector,as it is a drai for 2 that your opponent can deploy to. Get set up with the MegFalcon+
Savrip combo, then drop Scramble and clear the ground. Flip, Celebration, win.

THIS DEAL Start Ultimatum just in case DD comes out. Drop the sector quickly so you can gain early control and a quick flip. Using Path, Sramble,
and Savrip, you should win easy as they will be fighting you on your turf.

ENDOR OPS Tough one Start Ultimatum for drains. Since you get hella force from opponent, flip quick. Get ultimatum running and once Celebration
and Pucimir come out, you should win the drain race.

ISB Easy game. Start Ultimatum for drains again. Flip quick so no agent -1, no walker decree, and no Coruscant Bright Center. Pucumir+Celebration,
win. (Plus, with all interior sites, walker decks won't be doing much to stop you).

CCT Start Goo Nee Tay. Give them EPP Obi as he is the least important rebel in the deck. Drop on them at the CC, free Obi, flip, Path, Savrip and
Scramble, you win.

That's it. QMC does look pretty crappy, but I have found it to be quite potent.
