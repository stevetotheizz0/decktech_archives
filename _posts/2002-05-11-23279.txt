   RESPONSE TO REVIEWS------

To Garion: Well, there are only so many systems withins 3 of hoth, and getting that drain of 2 is useful.  But I suppose your comment does have some merit... Kashyyyk might do better.  But please, dont leave me hanging - tell me how to fix the problem please.

To Tarkinsaide, OQrygg, Wedge231, etc..: The tramples arent supposed to be just randomly thrown around.  With MM, Twilek, and other recyclable stuff, I can do a little tracking.

To Frenchie6901: Yeah, you have a few decent points.  However, I have a garunteed pull of 4 of my locations, usually 6, fairly quickly.  That leaves the 4th and 6th markers, which are very important for that extra activation and damage.  North ridge is actually pretty nifty, as your AT-ATs move to it for free.  Ive already done a modified version with more space, but you dont necessarily need too much.  Just enough to have a decent presence.  And theres always ghhhk just in case.  Yes, the WIAPN (admirals orders) has its benifits, but I like the other one better.

To Drew Man1:  Uh, yeah.  So next time can you tell me something useful?

To Meto:  yeah...right.  just because there are lots of mains and toys decks out doesnt mean thats the only way to go.  Maybe you just havent played against a *GOOD* walker deck yet, but they can pack a punch assuming ye know what yer doin.
  And dont give a rating just cause its in the top ten.  Thats just a bull crap reason, giving a deck a lower rating just to lower its status.  At least show enough insight to explain a low rating instead of putting in a non-descript response like (quote) Whats this doing in the top ten?  
  I really dont mind if you slam the deck, but please give a reason if you do.

To Kiriel:  the tie cannons are an interesting thought, but I’m already packed for room and it’s just kinda card intensive to work so hard for that one battle to knock out one starship.  usually.  thx for the insight though, new ideas are always appreciated.

  END RESPONSES-------------


  Well heres another one to add to my Hoth Big Blues collection.  I was looking at my old ones, decided they were kinda scrubby, so made a new one, which I believe to be a lot stronger.  

  Plays like a walker deck.  Everyone knows how its done.  Pull a couple locations, deploy a couple walkers, damage, ghhhk, and beat.  Oh, and then damage some more.  Pretty much just dominate the whole game damage wise.  But I suppose I need to be a little more specific for the strat section.

...I was just thinking, maybe trading Xizor out for another dr. e combo would be a good idea.  Keep the defensive ability and add some more offensive cabability, that might be a good idea.  But whatever.  Xizor has his place too.


  First off, a few notes.
-WTF? Masterfull Move?  No Ghhhk combo?

 I adress these together as they are related in reason.  Masterfull move is an easily recyclable 6 (lord knows my deck needs sixes when it can get em :), and it can pull ghhhk, but not ghhhk combo.

-2 vaders AND 2 mauls? kinda overcompensating, isnt it?

 Not really.  I used to play with just 1 of each, and it worked decntly.  But just those two extra cards made a HUGE difference in the versatility of the deck.  Being able to discourage attack and beat down is extremely valuable, as both maul and vader can do.  Put maul at the defensive per. with a walker and dr. e, and not many ppl will want to touch them.  Of course, you do want to be careful here... walker decks have a notoriously low overall destiny.

-2 imp commands? shouldnt you play with AT LEAST 3?

 Well, I might play a third if I had one, but between Piet, merrijk, the 2 commands, and the locations I would be pulling, theres a decent chance Ill have at least one of the above in my hand turn 1, most always by turn 2.

-Activation hurts walker decks, you probably need more locations in there.

 Yeah, well thats one of the improvements over my last version, actually.  2 PotFs with a twilek, the added system (Naboo), and the normal stuff (IAO, merrijk) usually get me enough to get by.  It can be rough sometimes, but I usually squeak by in those games where there is a force choke.  just a few icons from the opponent will usually be enough.

-What about your dinky little space force?  Han C and Falc will chew it up!

 True, but walkers dont fly do they?  No, they spend their time stomping ppl ON THE GROUND.  Thus, most of your effort should be concentrated on the ground in 95% of your games.  

-What about the other Ad order?

 I used to play it, but frankly I didnt play it.  It was nice to have that 1 damage every once in a while (a long while), but other than that the other ad order is much more useful.  The walker deployment and battle destiny limitations are extremely valuable in this deck.  

-Enter the Beuracrat? Right.....
 Well, as well as walkers do against combat, it can still pose a problem is it is a good player.  Just use fanfare as a defensive shield and pull ETB to put a stop on his drains early.  That should give you some leeway.

Thats all for that, Ill add more as needed.

 Since everyone puts it in, heres the destiny layout (no start cards):
 0 - 8
 1 - 17
 2 - 7
 3 - 3
 4 - 13
 5 - 2
 6 - 4
 7 - 0

 Yeah, I know its not that great (pretty bad actually), but ideally by end game youll have most of the characters, locations, and starships/vehicles out.  Not all, cause youll need some to work with lol, but most.  Dont forget you can track masterfull move around.  Also, you really want to depend on the sheer power of the walkers, ghhhk, and the ad ord + imp command to limit their battle destinies.  Actually, there is a garunteed pull of 4 locations, usually 6, so that always helps.

PRE GAME
 Gloat at your opponent (just kidding.  Try to be nice lol)

START
 Always start the same things as I have listed.  YMSYL is, uh, duh, never mind.  Prep for a SA is good for SD deployment and against HB, senate, and AITC when they will cancel your drains.

 Maybe if they started honor you would start No escape instead of PFASA, possibly imp decree against EBO.

 Anyways, pull 3rd marker and garrison as your first action before you activate.  If you have an imp command, do that second.  

EARLY
 Activate and pull Exec: DB preferably, as it chokes the opponent and makes deploying piet easier.  Work on getting activation up, dump some walker at the 5th marker to get annoying damage in, or at the 3rd if you have a ghhhk.  
 Try to set up shop at def perim and another hoth site fast.  And remember, presence of the force is pain in the you-know-what early in the game when you have to lose 4 second turn to a lone imperial walker at the 3rd marker.

------------------------------
As promised, heres the Hoth (Big) Blues Jingle:

Its Saturday Night on Hoth! (dun-dun, dun-dun!)
The Suns-a-goin down! (dun-dun, dun-dun!)
It sure is cold out there 
But its better than under a walker foot!
Ohhh Yeahhhh Ive got the Hoth (Big) Blues Babyiiieee! (duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh--duh---duh-----.....bwoooowwwnnnngggg......)

Ohhhh Yeaaahhhhhhh....Ha-haaa... One more time Rusty!
-------------------------------
Thanks for reading this far, now heres the rest of the strat.  Youre almost finished anyways, you might as well read on :)


MID
 Spread, activate, destroy.  Drain your opponent.  If he comes down pray you have a ghhhk and forfeit away.  Then drop Vader, tarkin, maul, dr e, or any suitable combo above to knock em out.  Personally, I think this is a lot more fun than ice storming.  So anyways, then just go back to draining.

 Assuming everything goes decently well, you should be dominating by now.  The damage should be pouring in faster than a wookie could sweat in a stormtrooper outfit on Tatooine.  

 If he is playing light or no space, set up at naboo to drain for 2 and get out the ad orders for quick deployment.

 END
Well, you pretty much keep draining.  Sometimes, at the end, you can get off a garrison.  This is possibly THE most fun thing you can do with this deck.  Spread top all the hoth sites and you can get in a drain of 14, plus 4 to YMSYL and possibly 2 to RBO.  presence makes this even better.

Remember, its pretty much a non interactive deck, so dont go out of your way too much to cause too much trouble.  But remember, maul, vader, and dr. e make a pretty good team anywhere, dont hesitate when you see that obi-wan guarding that lone little pucumir thryss... hehe

QMC
Only hard agaist a good player.  You can outdamage them if you work quickly, and even beatdown a few times on CC.  Main danger is if they play too much space.  Be careful, patient, and cautious and it is very winnable.

Profit
profit cant really keep up with walkers.  it just cant.  podprofit would be interesting, but Ive never had to play against it.

WYS
this game should be in the bag unless they get a uberfast set up.  Their drains are big enough early to be annoying, but thats what ETB is for, right?  And the Ad order puts a stopper on multiple battle destinies on hoth.

MWYHL
If you set up fast they are toast.  if you dont youre... well youre not toast.  Maybe a muffin....  No just kidding.  Try to get that ad orders that limits b destinies out so they cant use a test 5 seven too much.  damage fast and early.

MAINS
ghhk away if they play ground or space, spread out a little bit when you can.  use trample to knock out key mains.  use ad order.

SENATE
  No way they can keep up with the damage.  They cant cancel your drains and decree keeps theirs small.

LSC
damage fast and early, use ETB, beat down someone if you can.  did I mention damage fast?

EBO
can be a hard mathup, since you lose your battlegrounds.  garrison when you can, use imp decree, and of course No Escape.

I guess thats about it.  Hope yall enjoyed your nap while reading my strat section :)

I hope the sound effects I tried to add to the jingle worked. (the dun-duns, duh-duhs, and the bwooonnnggg...)  tell me if they didnt and Ill take them out...lol.

thx for the reviews and cya round
