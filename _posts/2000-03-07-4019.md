Strategy: '

As said in the description, I don't focus on the flip, but I can in the right situations.

Strategy vs. Major decks right now.

vs. Profit
Start Surface Defense with Secret Plans and Resistance. Give them Mara Jade and Cloud City Engineer. Use 2 of the starting force to get your Audience Chamber to the top. This allows you to get Jabba from the reserve deck on the next turn. Get Rancor Pit and Mara's Saber from the reserve deck. Get Rancor on the next turn and try to Trap Door Han to the Rancor Pit. Imperial Barrier, You Are Beaten, Hutt Smooch, and Sniper will all help as will the light SA element.

vs. Hidden Base
Start Resistance and Secret Plans. Set up Mara at the Audience Chamber. You have two Twi'leks to get Security Precautions. Damage due to the objective will help. Try to keep any mains off of Tatooine. Try to get some people into the Rancor. A tough game vs. Balanced HB with Our Most Desperate Hour. The light SA element will help as will starting with Secret Plans. Also being able to get the ships from reserve will allow you the luxury of not having to search for ships.

vs. Operatives
Start Battle Order. Set up some small drain and damage from the objective will hurt. Get Boba In Slave I to the operative planet. Beware the speeder beatdown.

vs. Jedi Test
Start Resistance and Secret Plans. Again set up whatever drain you can and damage from the objective will take its toll.

vs. Throne Room Start
Start Crush The Rebellion and make them come to you. Imperial Barrier and You Are Beaten will help hurt them small amount of characters they can throw at you.

A few tricks
Search for a Shocking Revelation each turn so you know if you need to draw. Utilize Dr. E's operation ability. With a Jabba's Palace and a Rancor Pit you should be able get the Rancor Pit out to Trap Door some people, so hopefully the Rancor can have lunch.

Looks OK on paper, but I haven't been able to playtest it yet. Wondering what your thoughts are on the SA. Should I ditch it for There Is No Try in the start and add some tricks or keep it?
