Strategy: 

Please read the Objective before reviwing.
This deck tries to establish Dark Deal and occupation as quickly as possible. Your opening hand consists of Security Tower(giving you access to Lando anytime), Fett and Fett in Slave I. Fish for Bes:CC when you have the charcters to control the sites. If you draw one CC: Site and one character or Starfighter/Bounyt Hunter In Ship you can have Dark Deal in 3 turns. The Obj gives you secret plans from the start , which is great to slow done or stop retrieval all together and All wrapped up can surprise an unsuspecting opp who foreits around one of your BH. The Immunity to Goo Nee Tay for several charcters is great along with searching your deck for one of 4 cards . You can check your destinies at any time.  To protect yourself on CC I have several means. Imp Barrier prevnts unwanted battles. BFHI adds to the deploy slowing early beatdowns.  Better yet, Let him deploy his mains to Tatooine and throw down Imp arrest order. Unless he brought a docking bay, he can't get in to CC. The forfeit boost is also nice. Mara, Vader and Tarkin can roam the galaxy whil your scrubs drain away on CC with Dark deal and possibly occupation.

Against Profit: They can have Han. Let them deploy Leia or Obi oe whoever slap down IAO and drain away. They might hurt you for 2-3 a turn but your drain total will surpass theirs. Sending your droid BH to capture Han with a Vader or Mara escort is alway helpful. Also

Against HB: Don't deploy Bespin till he flips. when he flips deploy Bespin, probe and sit there to set Occupation. Likewise at Kessel and Kiffex. That should win the drain race, especially when combined with CC Occupation.  Deploy Bes: CC only with a starfighter ready to flip. Throw down dark deal and drain like crazy. Probe with the Bounty Hunters.

Against Revolver/mains: This will slow you down but not stop you. Set up DD ASAP use Crush and Jodo to limit his destiny drawing ability on CC. Don't go to him. Stay on CC. Use the lift tube to react as needed. This deck also makes the mandatory nabrun leids worthless.

Against OPs: Stay away. Use Battle Order to slow them down. Try to outdrain them. Speeder ops/Beatdown is useless as all your sites are interior.

Jedi Testing: This could hurt try to get to Dagobah with the Bus loaded with a	few characters to try to stop the apprentice. I am tryind to add a Broken Concentration or the Faliure at the Cave combo in my deck. The 2 force would be nice in addition to a JT defense. A failure should let you drain big for a few turns hopefully combined with Occupation. Also flipping your objective is recommended in this case also.

Above all, stay focused. Don't try to flip the Objective. Just go for a quick drain race. Be wary of spreading too thin. I am still looking for ways to speed up this deck. Any advice or critiscm is welcome.
