update october 14th
I just deleted two ratings. TJ`s half-star and a one-star.


update march 17th
I deleted a halfstar. ”dumb” said Ou ne ta, but I still know that and during worlds this card wasn`t legal.
I played this deck in several small tournaments and even against Ou ne ta you can win (you must not). But normaly I play other Dark Decks.
I also added some cards
Bikes and Highspeedtacticts against Patrol Crafts, Xizor, Arica and Emperor, but him only to have a card with Destiny 6 for Trample...

-end update-

This deck does not need a strategy section.
Play your own game. Flip, drain, search and desroy.
If your opponent wants to block your drains, barrier and beat him down.

This deck went 4-0 in my Regional, 3-0 at continental day 1, 2-1 at day 2 (i had to play quickly to catch my flight), 4-0 at Worlds Day 2
and 1-1 at day 3.

I beat Bastian Winkelhaus, Hayes Hunter, Raphael Asselin, Gary Carmen and many other top ranked players with this deck.

Now it is dead, Jabba`s Palace (Ou Ne Ta) has killed it.

Martin Falke, 6th place at Worlds
