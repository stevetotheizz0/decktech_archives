Strategy: '

Well First off this deck has the awsome concept of being annoying to people. This deck is fun though for you. The deck has gone 24-1 in turney play and place 4th and 5th in the North American Championships. (played by corey and justinof wisconsin team)


Well first off the activation is sick the ability to only give the dark side 1 force icon the entire game is huge, and since the dark side is screwed for activation anyways. Second, always win the race. and during the race insert anger fear and odds if they dont have any protection. 

Third after winning the race retrive the anger fear for another anger fear run.


In this deck you always get an anger fear always  with mess, signal, or 3PO. Awsome tech


Mess good in this deck because dont like your hand play it get a new one. Awsome tech.


The epps just use for only hit and run but if you get the combo kill him with the destiny adders 





Mach ups


Ties 

auto win anger fear and the race with no odds protection you kill them.


Racing 

Auto win grab the racing interupts. Also just keep the anger fear up and win the race.


Mains and toys 

kill kill kill i mean not a hard mach up you win anger fear with the commando tactics of the epps and they keep coming back win.


Watto obj

The watto obj is a breeze because the race plus the anger fear. Also add in hit a runs its a killer deck and honnor.

Just make sure you hit watto hard early in the game and hit him with the occ.


This deck has been play tested to the max and believe that it kick hard core ass.

But with the new shield card the game is getting lame I think.   '
