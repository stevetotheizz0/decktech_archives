Strategy: 

Yah I know probe droids. The idea came to me that maybe Probe Droids with there spy ability and high forfiet could work in a RalOps deck. Use IAO and Mobilization Points to get some force activation. Use Mobilization Points to get out Rendili. Start out by getting a SD to Ralltiir. Put some Droids down with some imperials. Once Ralltiir is fortified you can deploy and battle elsewhere. Use probe telementry to get rid of some non-unique cards (like eloms). Also use Abysin Ornament for force retrieval. Another thing in here is that Stalker is your most valuble SD so place it wisely. If your having trouble on Ralltiir put it there if you are ready for on offensive deploy him there. Just one thing, don’t judge this because it is different than most RalOps decks. Think about it for a while.
