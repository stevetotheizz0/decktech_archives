UPDATE

Thanks to all of you who gave me some usefull advice.

I have made some changes that are not posted.

And this deck is still doing well.


I Understand many of you dont have 4 mauls with sabers..But thats why I call this deck..Mauls Obsession.

But if you can get the Mauls...this is the way to go.



First Round

-Pull Rendili (If Mob points Is not canceled)

-Pull Spaceport DB (Deploy to Rendili)


Rest of the game...

-Deploy Vader to get visage damage running.

-Use Dark Rage to deploy Deep Hatred ,if you dont draw it.

-Use Vader ,Maul and Mara Jade to Epic Duel

Remember you can use Deep Hatred to stack cards under your dark jedi  and use them for Epic Duel.


-Use Maul,Vader and Emperor for lightsaber combat.

You can use Masterful Move or Twilek  to pull Visage of the Emperor and The Phantom Menace, to stack sevens under the character you want to Duel or Lightsaber Combat with.


-Keep pulling Docking Bays to get the zeros out of your deck. Deploy Walkers to them.

set up Imperial Decree.

Use Blizzard 4 to pull Vader or Mara Jade


-Take out the tramples if you feel you need more sevens in the deck. (I put them in cause I love to trample)


-Pull Imperial Holotable for extra force. 


-Space is strong in this deck.

Split forces between Sullest and Rendili

If they play a space deck. build forces at one system and drain at Docking bays.


MATCH UPS


- Mains & Toys

You have 2d7 and 5d6 to set-up for high destiny draws. Use deep Hatred to stack high numbers under characters.Something Special Planned and Secret plans will stop force retrievel.


-Mind what you have learned

This Objective is a joke...they spend most of the time testing and you make them lose force.Keep the Drains and visage going and Deploy a hologram to the holotable and you will drain them to nothing before they complete all the test.Secret Plans will hurt them then.


-Profit

They provide the mains you provide the beatdown.Deploy the spaceport Docking Bay right at Jabbas Door and walk right in with force.


-Rebel Strike Team

Deploy  all the ships to Endor and control the Bunker. and you can shut-down with huntdown.


-Echo Base Operations

Set-up Imperial Decree and send characters in under the shields in walkers (just like the movie) this will protect you from Ice-storm untill you get inside.


-Watch Your Step

Drop all your ships at kessel. and deploy your mains to the Cantina.Denger w blaster and Dr E can take care of all those stupid smugglers.

Me likes to trample em


-Well Handle This

I made this deck for this match-up.

This is where Deep Hatred comes in.

Build forces buff up Vader and Maul and deploy Spaceport DB to Theed Palace then Huntdown and Destroy the Jedi.

Even if they beat you...You will have fun with this match-up.


NOTE

I have extra Mara Jade sabers cause I always lose one.(You should change it out for the  Starting Defensive Shields Effect.)
