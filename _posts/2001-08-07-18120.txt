UPDATE **** Heading For The Medical Frigate? I meant to have Prepared Defenses.****

***Due to the reviews, I have taken out Vengance,  Ion Cannon, a TIE Interceptor, and a Turbolaser Battery to put in A Day Long Remmbered, Death Star Assualt Squadron, Dreaded Imperial Starfleet, and Put All Sections On Alert***

Simple. Look at the SYCFA text and it says, you blow away Alderaan, you flip the Objective I relly don?t use the SYCFA Death Star card pull except for the Superlaser and Gunners. 

Once you flip it, your Star Destroyers become much more usefull, especially at Hoth, Yavin 4, Tatooine, and Bespin. Kessel was thrown in for the deploy -1 cost for the Star Destroyers you deploy in the CCG Outer Rim. While your other Star Destroyers go at the Death Star system for the -2 while Death Star moves from Yavin to Hoth, your Star Destroyer cruise around with their weapons to disable the opponents starfighters incase they play MBO. 

Your Ion Cannons make the opponent?s ships armor or manuever=0 and hyperspeed=0, so it?s easier to hit them with the Batteries and SfS L-s9.3 Laser Cannons. You have to blow away Yavin 4 as quick as you can if your opponent is playing MBO or else he?ll blow up the Death Star. Death Star Gunners add to the firing as well.

Basically, drain at the Battleground systems and battle an shot down whoever you need to    '
