Strategy: '

Stategy This deck is basically your non-flip, overpower Endor Operations deck. On your first turn, before you activate, grab Perimeter Parol with You Cannot Hide Forever. Then deploy some people down to Endor to set up Ominous Rumours, which you grabbed using the objective. On following turns solidify your control of Endor locations and make sure you control Kessel, Dagobah, Sullust, Endor, and the Endor locations so you can drain for 22 a turn once everything is set up. Use Commander Merrjk to pull the systems. Okay, now I’ll go over the cards in my deck, and why they’re in there.


Endor Operations/Imperial Outpost- I can grab Ominous Rumors

Endor Bunker- the objective makes me deploy it and it’s where Perimeter Patrol goes

Endor Landing Platform- the objective makes me deploy it and I get activation bonuses from Mobilization Points

Prepared Defenses- so I can grab 3 effects that deploy for free 

Imperial Decree- if I control 1 site, and 2 locations, Revolution, and force drain bonuses for my opponent are ignored.

Mobilization Points- so I can activate +1 at Endor Landing Platform (Docking Bay) and +2 if I control.

You Cannot Hide Forever- as stated previously, so I can grab Perimeter Parol

4-LOM With Concussion Rifle- if any EPP beatdown squad comes in, I can cancel their game text

Admiral Chiraneau- good pilot and force drains are +1 at all my systems where I have a Star Destroyer

Admiral Piett- good pilot and so I can grab a commander or Battle Deployment

Arica- in case my opponent is playing EBO and the draining gets huge at a system, this is why I have Arica instead of Mara Jade

Commander Igar- to pilot Tempest 1 or Blizzard 2

Commander Merrjk- to pull systems

Darth Vader with Lightsaber- power also in case of There Is Good In Him, I don’t have room to pack his saber

Guri- power

Grand Admiral Thrawn- good pilot

Grand Moff Tarkin- ahhhhh the infamous duo

Prince Xizor- great fighter, okay pilot

Snoova- power and to capture some @#$%gots

U-3P0- to spy on the traitors

Boba Fett In Slave I- beast with shear power

Bossk In Hound’s Tooth- another beast with shear power

Chimera- Thrawn’s flagship

Dengar In Punishing 1- him and zuckuss are @#$%

Devastator- good power

Thunderflare- some nice power here

Vengeance- just a Star Destroyer so I can get Chiraneau’s bonuses at all systems

Zuckuss In Mist Hunter- him and dengar are @#$%

Blizzard 2- an AT-AT to kick some @#$% and take some names

Tempest 1- for Igar

Tempest Scout 2,3,4, and 6- power and mobility

Vibro Axe- for Snoova

Ominous Rumors- for the drain +2 at other systems

Oppressive Enforcement- SAC protection

Perimeter Patrol- so if some hot-shot that doesn’t read game text sees my Commander Merrjk alone, he has to lose 1 force and the cards he deployed cannot move or battle for the remainder of his turn, so when I move in the troops, he starts to cry

Reactor Terminal- I can’t live without this card. I like to draw, and this allows me to put back the cards I don’t need

Secret Plans- more force drain bonus protection

Security Precautions- for those losers who play Hidden Base

Something Special Planned For Them- goodbye Harvest, and the extra movement force might wreak havoc on their plans

Sunsdown & Too Cold For Speeders- ANSB/EBO/EBG is big here, so drop this on Hoth, and byebye speeders and I can come down with my Vader and Tarkin and destroy the rebel base

Defensive Fire & Hutt Smooch- byebye Bousshie Woushie

Ghhk & Those Rebels Won’t Escape Us- cancel Hyper Escape for X-Wing swarm pussies, and the cancel all remaining battle damage sounds good too =)

Imperial Command- take 1 admiral or general into hand, or I could prevent my opponent from drawing more than 1 battle destiny against my admiral or general or I could draw an extra battle destiny with my admiral or general

Lateral Damage- byebye Mr. Home One

Evader & Monnok- X-Wing Swarm pussies, I’ve got news for you

Sniper & Dark Strike- knock off some mains before the battle

Twi’lek Advisor- pulling some effects baby

Battle Deployment- jeez lueez read the card, it’s awesome for this deck

Endor Back Door- drain for 2

Endor Dark Forest- drain for 2

Endor Forest Clearing- drain for 2

Dagobah- drain for 5 with Chiraneau and Ominous Rumors also force drains at Dagobah sites are canceled if I occupy

Kessel- drain for 4 with Chiraneau and Ominous Rumors also deploy -1 and Kessel Run is canceled

Sullust- drain for 5 with Chiraneau and Ominous Rumors also if I occupy when Haven is canceled, opponent loses 8 Force.  


Thanks for reading all this @#$%.
