Strategy: '

A quick run down
* Jedi test #1 and #2 give you an edge in battles.
  Your opponent needs to deploy that little bit more
  ability to draw a battle destiny and no FD modifiers no more.
* Also the more characters the DS deploy the bigger
  the chance for a good Noble Sacrifice.
* Slow down the early draining game with Battle Plan
  and 'Wars Not Make One Great'.
* This deck concentrates on Space but is also capable
  to battle on the surface (this due to high
  Characters forfeit and Obi).
* And don't forget, Yoda on his hut is also nice
  during battle.

* There are enough high destinies for your JT to
   succeed. You should be finished with them around
   turn 4.

=> As some of you might have noticed, on of the weaknesses
   of this deck is numbers. It those are played in your
   area just substitute the two alters for
   'Don't Forget The Droids'.
