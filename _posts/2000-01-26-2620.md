Strategy: '

This deck is very easy to play.  Just start with ISB, Coruscant and Imperial Arrest Order.  Pull either Yavin 4 or Hoth docking bays first.  Just save up force.  Put a couple cheap ISBs there, and by turn 3, you can flip the objective.  Keep pulling docking bays with IAO and dropping ISBs like mad.  Play some mains and high-stats guys to back up your relatively weak ISBs.  Stick Mara and her glowstick at Back Door or Cantina for a drain of 3, 4 with an ISB there.  Use the Undercovers for blocking a big drain.  There Is No Try keeps your red cards safe.  The bounty hunter ships will keep space pretty well covered for additional drains. Make sure to leave a couple sites with only spies that look pretty 'weak' to your opponent.  When the beatdown comes, drop Sneak Attack.  Boom, instant power or battle destiny at least +3 or +4  Stick Chall at Cantina or Docking Bay 94, and pull the one ORS if it's not already out.	There's only one for fear of Grimmy, and plus I only have one.  Watch out for MWYHL, though, it can hurt you.	Broken Concentration should be a great help, though.  Good Luck, and May The Force Be With You. '
