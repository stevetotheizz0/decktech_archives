Strategy: 

I’d just like to mention that I CAN use the Imp Barrier, once I flip the objective!!! People PAY attention!!! Well the wording on the card sucks, so I’m not sure, but I found better stuff to put in instead...ouuuuuuu Alter :) 
I’d like to put in another Choke Vader instead of a LV.
Teemto’s in there just in case, and he’s a destiny 5, if you don’t need it for the racing it’s always nice to have around. Also the destinies are one of the troubles in this deck, it’s hard to keep them up high, but now with the new effect you can pull the zero’s.
Why IAO? Because I can pull the DB, for some early generation with Mob Points, plus it gives me an extra site to drain at.

So first turn before you activate pull Rendili, and the 2 int sites, you can get 12-15 force the 2nd turn, but you’re giving the light side A LOT for their turn too.

Some Matchups I’ve played:
vs. EBO, set up FAST, EBO sets up fast, you have to set up faster, if you can set up first you can win, if not after getting DD and occupation, try to slow down their draining with some BH ships, most EBO decks are ment to run, so try to make them do it.

vs. MBO, yeah whatever if you see it drain early, and chances are he’ll lose a critical card to his strategy, trech, torps, AR. Should be EASY!!!

vs. Testing (or anything with Menace Fades), ok you’ll have a HARD time hear, get DD, for the power, and get Occupation too, with that you should be making the opponent lose 6-10 force a turn, try to cut down their retrieval with Secret Plans, if they come to you, chances are you can take them out with power houses, like Vader, Mara, and Maul.

vs. Profit, DRAIN DRAIN DRAIN!!! You should be able to beat their retrieval, just forget about them

vs. QMC, don’t let them get Bespin and you should be alright, if you’re doing things right you should always be on CC, so they’ll never flip their Objective.
