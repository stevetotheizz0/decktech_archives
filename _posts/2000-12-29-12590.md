Strategy
Try to get everything as fast as you can. You can look for tons of cards really fast. Dont make unnecessary deployments unless youre safe. Controlling Yavin 4 will be key. Once youre strong at Yavin take deploy Battle Deployment and youll be quite safe against mains (theyre limited to one destiny).

Take much care and not overdeploy. You can make huge drains (Organas, Overseeing and Presence will make it possible) without deployng everything (take advantage from AT-ST react capabilities).

More detalied

VS Profit Let him make his play. Your force drains are much stronger (dont forget Battle Order and alway thinking if he spreads) than is and youll be quite safe vs mains (reacting + Battle Deployment + imperial command + Emperor and fellas). Should be easy.

VS HB Swarm Same thing, but space will be much more critical. Battle Deployment will help you a lot (every X-Wing will be -2 power). If he tries to battle you youve got tons of forfeit to stand vs them. If he spreads take Sec. Prec. and go probing with Zuckuss. Tough but should win.

VS Superfalcon stand with your forfeit and power until you get Zuckuss and Imperial command. Easy win.

VS QMC dont go for them. You should overdrain them. Easy win.

VS EBO change your mind. You dont need Yavin anymore. Go and conquest Hoth You blizzards will provide you cover vs storms. Tougher on space (usually Battle Deployment wont help). Tough but should win.

VS Theres good in him Thats why Vaders for. Dont bring Yavin docking bay until youve got him. Another goo strategy is take Luke inside a blizzard and let them destroy it. If he plays mains use Battle Deployment. VS eloms your trample will be a must. Not too difficult.  '
