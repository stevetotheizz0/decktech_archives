Strategy: 

I apologize for the length, but I want people to understand that this isn't just a silly sabacc deck.

First of all I will go over why Sabacc is so powerful.	A lot of people underestimate it, and here is why they shouldn't.
1. Retreival:  This is obvious.  Every time you play it with Lando at tbe Casino, you retreive three cards.  This is huge.
2. Knowledge of Opponent's deck:  Every time you play, you get to look at 2-6 of the opponent's cards.  This gives you great knowledge of what is in their deck.
3. Removing opponent's key cards:  Because you're playing with Lando, you will always win.  Thus every game you can choose one of their cards to be lost.  Choose EPP's, or choose Landing Claws.  Choose Houjix, or Jedi Test 1.  Choose WAYTTPOUs, so they wont be able to grab Sabacc later.  It's incredible!
4. Stealing: You can steal X-wings, GLinG!, RLinR1, weapons, devices, it's insane!
5. Deck manipulation: People often forget that you can play Sabacc during your opponent's turn, thereby depleting his reserve deck, giving him no force to search for his Hidden Base, draw for weapon/battle destiny, search for effects, etc.  This can be crippling late in the game.

These are the main reasons why Sabacc is so good.  In this deck I start by getting out the Casino and Plaza, the only two sites you'll really need.  Drain (Use VLSaber to increase) here, and play Sabacc to up their force loss and retreive.  Hide Lando in a vehicle to keep him safe both from EPP fire and replacement.	I don't think replacement is that big of a deal, because no on plays with CC Lando, and Lando in Falcon will not get out quickly enough to stop you from deploying yours.  I don't expect to see ECC Lando much, but if you fear him, keep Lando safe in a vehicle.  If you have no lost pile, play Sabacc while he's inside.  If you have a lost pile, he can jump out during your move phase, play, retreive, then jump back in.  It's not that bad leaving him out and vulnerable, because if he's killed, you can usually deploy another next turn.  If he's replaced, you can easily kill their Lando, then deploy another of your own.

I have in plenty of force generating locations.  Bright Center works for Ops off D* or Coruscant.  I have in Battle Order and can easily fulfill it.  Revo isn't a problem with Alters, and Evader with CTRebellion, which also works incredibly on Clash, pulling out IHYnow, and limiting Rebel destinies on mobile sites, which my main sites are.	Great effect.  Sec Prec is also in for Hidden Base, as is IAO, which makes it tough to get to the Med Chamber, ups forfeits, and stops EPP hit squads from sneaking in.

Sniper is very underrated.  It screws any light undercover spies, will be recycled with Sabacc, and is great for slicing up EPP's.  SAC is also underestimated recently, and will surprise many opponents.

I have in a lot of characters.	Lando is the main Sabacc player, but just in case something goes wrong Brangus or Evazan can also play.

Finally, do not underestimate the retreival.  Once you get going, you can play Sabacc almost every turn.  Of course grabbers are a problem, but most LS decks that play them only play one or two.  If I suspect this, I try to draw them out and make them grab Sense or Alter or Twi Lek, then I keep playing Sabacc in hopes of removing their last grabber.  It really does work.  This deck has incredible power and is well rounded and prepared to take on anything.  Believe me, it will surprise a lot of people.
