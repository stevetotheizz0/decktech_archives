Objective
ISB Operations / Empires Sinister Agents
'

Strategy: '

Begin w Imperial Arrest Order. Deploy ISBs everywhere.
Play 5D6 at the opponents main planet. Anti-revolution
would be Evaders and spies to the site where Oola is hidden.
Yavin 4 and sunsdown is included if the opponent ignores
you activation. Since you deploy en masse in the beginning,
often without ability, five Ghhhks are included, and a combat
readiness (maybe two?). With luck and fast play, your drain should
outnumber the opponents quickly. Screws takes care of any eventual
EPP-character (preferrably Han). Against space decks, you just deploy
docking bays, and spies to subtract one from opponents drains at related
locations. The deck has one problem w monnok, many ghhks, but otherwise,
monnok should not be a problem.'
