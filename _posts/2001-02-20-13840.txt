Strategy: '

Use the snowspeeders, Orri, and EPP Obi to secure the North Ridge.  Use the lucky shots to hit walkers if they come to Hoth.  Otherwise use your space force to drain and attack fleets.  Dual cannons are better for this than Harpoons, because they can target characters too.

First turn use ANSB to pull EBG and an Echo location, then use EBG to pull a Rouge speeder.
Keep pulling Echos and Rouges until you can get EBO set up.  Try to get Carlist out as soon as possible to make it effectively impossible to cancel EBO until and unless he gets hit.

BHBM  Put Luke on Rouge 1 at North Ridge, because you wont lose force to Your Destiny, but he can’t be captured.

ISB  Tough, because some ISB decks are Hoth-oriented.  You will have to play smart, but you should be able to win.

SYCFA  You will have to play smart in space, but you should be able to hurt them on the ground and set up some good drains.
