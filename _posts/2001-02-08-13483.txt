Strategy: '

This is a somewhat simple strategy to follow.  First turn, use Mob. Points to get out Kuat and IAO to get out Executor DB.  Then, use either Imperial Command to get Piett and Merrejk, or if you drew one of the two of them.  Somehow, get Merrejk to Executor DB, and start pulling systems.  Second turn, your activating 8 by yourself.  Use Twi’lek advisor to get SFS and deploy is ASAP.  Then proceed to deploy TIE bombers and start force draining.  

I haven’t played this deck against anything yet, in fact, it’s not even built yet.  I just thought this was a cool idea for a fun deck.  Thoughts?  '
