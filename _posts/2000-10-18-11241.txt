Strategy: 

Overview:
Basically there is just a lot of power here.
Get out Establish Secret Base with the objective (there should be enough AT-ST’s and biker scouts. If not you can always lose it to a drain). And get out Perimeter Patrol with You Cannot Hide Forever. And get THE ENDOR SHEILD!
Most of the sites have a force drain bonus+a LIGHTsaber+Presence of the Force+expand the Empire. Usually a drain of three a site. DO spread out your force drains!!
Why? If someone can cancel your drains, they’ll cancel the big ones. Can’t cancel ’m all though. Scout Recon for the recyclable 6. This deck needed powerful starships that’s why those are there. Force lightning is a good recycle card. Use the lost part at the end of your turn JUST IN case .
Keep the emperor @ Endor To Jump up the force drains because he’ll be ”Overseeing it Personally.”
Use Expand on the site that allows you a force drain of +1
Thanks. Please Reveiw!!!!!!!!!!! I’ll do the same thing for ya!
