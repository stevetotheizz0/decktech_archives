Objective
Set Your Course for Alderaan/The Ultimate Power in the Universe'

Strategy: '

Basically you start with Death Star, Alderaan, Death Star Docking Bay, and Twi'lek for Imperial Arrest Order. On first turn you get out Death Star War Room and Executor Docking Bay. This gives you at least 9 force by turn 2. Just drop twix sites and maybe get a drain going at the Death Star Docking Bay, Alderaan, and/or Coruscant. If they come down to the Death Star Docking Bay just play Put All Sections on Alert targetting any Rebels he puts down. I also have Tramples for your walkers so Trample if they come down also. And remember thar the objective cancels Revolutions. Here are some strategies against some decks

RTP You get to choke them pretty much. If you get a chance choke or Trample Leia. Get a few drains going in space or on the Death Star docking bay. Might be tough.

EBO They will probably be getting sufficient force to use so you'll have to go on the offensive. Send walkers and 2/2 guys down to Hoth. Set up Decree if you control Death Star/Alderaan or Coruscant and maybe you can control a Hoth site but you can always drop a guy or two down to Coruscant Imperial Square.

Mains Well you just get twix sites everywhere. Drop 2/2 guys in walkers and then wear em away. Maybe get a drain on the Death Star and with Put All Section On Alert you probably will be able to hold it.

HB Get some drains going on the Death Star docking bay. Twi'lek for Security Precautions. When they flip send Star Destroyers filled with 2/2 guys and probe away.

Numbers Play Resistance. They can't really occupy any battlegrounds so should be an easy win.

Tell me what you think.'
