Strategy: 

In Response to some reviews:

MadHatter - You ask why would i put POTF on the death star - well as i said this deck it taylored against WYS - so POTF makes the DS a battleground - hence i activate 4 instead of 1 at the DS. As for the drain, well sure it’s a big juicy drain or 4,but it gets them coming to my DS, and drop what they are doing (tat celebration, etc) meanwhile, I can still drain at the DS system, with Chiraneau there, it’s a drain of 2 and i can move the DS, so it will always be within 2 parsecs of my other systems, so i get the bonuses (and that ain’t half bad)


Hoostino: Yes a quick flipping WYS is tough - but chances are they leave themselves vulnerable, when they do - as for HB mains, I have had my easiest games against these decks -  i have the space to battle them (easily) and as for ground i will sit in the cantina and drain for 5 all game long (POTF on the cantina) - remeber i have some tricks up my sleeve (slash,choke,you are beaten,barrier, darkstrike etc) -  and yes sense and alter could hurt (a bit) but as i said, make changes as you see fit - sense and alter is dead in my area - ( i just recently pulled Oppressive/Tint - for Deng in push 1)

As for the rest: i will think about adding Mejjerik, but i don’t really have that many planets, and i haven’t had any problems in the past.

end of Response.




Well how to explain this deck, I originally started using the Sycfa objective for the force activation, and the protection for the emperor to sit at the DS docking bay. I used this platform for my Deceitful duel deck, and i loved it, so i thought i would make a powerful space deck, with strong ground support - WYS is pretty big in my area, so this deck is really metad for wys. Obviously make any changes you feel are necessary. Now to get into a little strategy.

1) Always start Mob points and something special planned - The third effect varies, pending on your opponent and their deck a good idea is to start You cannot hide forever (numbers really suck).

2) before you activate pull the flagship - now you might be wondering why no rendilli fact of the matter is, I dont need the force - usually in my hand i will have someone or better yet the emperor or a imperial command - so if i play Wys, they give me 2 force - with my objective, i am activating 5  plus 2 from the LS equals 7 --- I pull the war room, drop the emperor at the DS docking bay (or play an imperial command for ozzel, drop em for free) and 2nd  turn I am guaranteed 11-12 force - more then enough to get things going.

This deck really is made to adapt, if they go space wait for your goodies and then deploy and wasteem - drop blast door controls, play a set for stun and lat damage - next thing you know, your wailing on the Home 1 for like 22 force (right AL!) - if they are going ground you have the mains to deal withem being able to go through your deck really gives you a good idea on your destinies, and what cards are in your activation pile - people really underestimate SET FOR STUN its a huge card - its so easy to drop Dash with this card or if han and leia are giving you trouble in the falcon - get rid of han, or if your opponents space is bothering you, play a Lat damage and then play overwhelmed - get rid of the whole works, its real sweet watching your opponent set up all his space and think hes sitting pretty retrieving force with Tat celebration, then you drop the executor and a few admirals and play your cards - watch his space go to his used pile - and oh yeah Tatooine celebration is canceled.- with the admirals orders in this deck you dont have to worry about major destinies on the ground or deploy your admirals for cheap-cheap. - I will give you a couple of popular matchups.


WYS - Ok, this is a tougher match-up - get your space going right away and set up on tat - drop your cantina, and play a potf on the death star (so you still get your activation) - take over the cantina with the big boys (tarkin,vader and mara) - drop some more space on kashyyk  and find chiraneau - your opponent will have to play your game - and try to stop your drains - try and catch the opponents control - this card can be a pain in the a$$ - dont worry about their retreival, they are gonna do it anyway, just remember to place their card out of play (something special planned) - playing battle order early is good, cause your gonna own space in this game.


HB Mains: once again you will own space, or wait for them to drop some space and then pound the snot out of them - as far as ground forces just  hole up in the cantina and play your interrupts accordingly - (maybe keep guri on the ground in this game) over all they wont be able to keep up with you in space.

TIGIH: stay inside and make sure you have a bunch of characters together, dont lose battles  - be wary about keeping people on the Death star - very easy way for the LS to stack a card. - just battle smartly and drain accordingly.

EBO: get S&D going ASAP - keep your space going strong and keep dengar alive at all costs - catch the organized attack right away, try and find your monnok  right away , and use it - worst case scenario, go to hoth and take that place  over - with the blast door controls you dont have to worry about getting stuck at the outer marker.

Profit: You dont see it too often, but its gonna make a comeback - blast doors is a surprise card here - either go after han ASAP or stay away and drain - once again Set for stun is a huge card here, can save you for a few turns (very good late game card) battle plan is key, cause more then likely they wont have space, but if they  do - then you will have the game won!!!! - lat damage is huge!!!!!!!!!!


those are the key match-ups, I dont  want to go off and list all the other possible light side decks,  you should get the gist of it.


I will go into a  few card explanations.

Lateral damage x2: well we all know what this card does, but 2!! makes it twice as good. Most people wont see two coming, when you use one early - most LS players feel safe, they wont expect 2 lat damages. Plus, if they arent ready - this card is a GAME ENDER.

Blast door controls: WYS, flip side you cant play sense or alter - so guess what, you wont be getting rid of blast door controls all game!!! - oops sorry you cant play that rebel barrier - oh yeah, profit, sorry cant play narrow escape either - overall just a great card ( and a destiny 5, you cant beat that)

Overwhelmed: During deploy phase target a system where you have double the opponents total power. - place all opponents starships there into the used pile. So like i said before, they have a strong space force and you just dont feel like fighting - play a lat damage, then play this destiny 5 wonderful interrupt - and dont worry about their starships at all. (but just remember, they have the starships in there deck, so be careful. dont go spreading out.)

Sniper/Dark strike: GREAT CARD - slice and dispose - nuff said

Battle deployment: Admirals order - a great card for this deck, A) you have to have both starfighters and capitals present or your  starships are power -2 B) this is the part that i love, at sites related to the system you occupy, your opponent may not draw more then one battle destiny - absolutely perfect for WYS.

Were in attack  position now: Admirals order - basically your admirals deploy for cheap on your big blue ships - and your big blue ships get  immunity, or they add some more immunity. Awesome.


So there you have it, the deck I call Deceitful Command - its has only lost in friendly games (cause i didnt have numbers protection) - it currently sits at 11-1 in tournament play - I was gonna post this a while ago, but my provincials were coming up, and i didnt want to give anything away - oh yeah, this deck went undefeated in my provincials (BC, Canada) this deck helped me come in 3rd (missing the final confrontation by 3 differential. )
