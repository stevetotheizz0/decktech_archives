Here is a "model" of what will happen in a game

Turn 1
Deploy Hoth Echo Command Center from reserve deck (via A New Secret Base)
Deploy Echo Base Garrison from reserve deck (via A New Secret Base)
Pull Commander Luke Skywalker from reserve deck(via Echo Base Garrison)

Turn 2
Deploy Hoth Echo Corridor from reserve deck (via A New Secret Base)
Deploy Hoth Echo Med Lab from reserve deck (via A New Secret Base)
Pull Commander Wedge Antilles from reserve deck (via Echo Base Garrison)

Turn 3
Pull Echo Base Operations from reserve deck (via A New Secret Base)
Pull Zev Senesca from reserve deck (via Echo Base Garrison)
Deploy Wedge to Echo Command Center
Deploy Commander Luke to Echo Corridor
Deploy Zev to Echo Med Lab
Deploy Echo Base Operations

See? All done by turn 3. And this is assuming you don't have Echo Base Operations, Echo Base Garrison, any characters, or any Echo sites, in your starting hand

Ok, well, you can pull everything you're going to need (pretty much) from your reserve deck. Pull Echo Base Garrison (and one of the Rogue pilots) first turn, and then next turn pull Echo Base Ops. You can be set up easily by turn 3. Then pull systems and get your power 4, ability 2 (once you get incom corporation out) x-wings to the systems to drain.  Once you have EBO going, move all your characters to whatever site Incom Corp is at (you need to protect it). If they come down to battle on ground, You've got high forfeit (and they will probably leave you alone). In space, using laser cannons, and power pivots/direct assaults. Stop their drains with Rebel Fleet, and once you've got 8-10 x-wings on table, play all wings report in. You'll be able to retreive probably everything you've lost....

I have 5 signals, so I can pull yarna quickly for protection from Monnok.
