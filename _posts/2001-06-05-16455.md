Strategy: '

Choose your effect based on what your opponnent is doing. The default would be Mobil Points so you can grab the Executor. 


Card Choices

Endor Shield is in coz it costs alot for the LS to fly over for the big drain. It will help you I assure you. 


2 Admiral’s Orders Attack Position is for the early game to get your ships setup, and Battle Deployment for mid-late game so you can hold the ground with the few guys/walkers you have.


Scythe 3 as a last line of defense in the DS2. Anyone can fly it to get the move and shoot benefit.


Dune Walker is for Igar. Sure it costs more, but it results in a double battle destiny. It is better than Blizzard 2. I gar does, in fact, add a destiny on this thing because it is non-unique. 


Podracing is pretty big in Vegas now, so it is in here for defense. You can go with or without it. I choose with...


Strategy Pull Endor Shield with Bunker Text and put Jerjerrod in there and build the DS2. I haven’t seen JarJar much, so if he’s big in your area, play a little more carefully. Assuming you have an Imp Command, Pull Piett and Merrejk and Fondor when you is ready to drop the Executor. Then move it to Endor and shuttle up all 3 dudes. Once the DS2 is operational, Either go to a planet that they may have deployed, or if that hasn’t happened, go to Fondor. Get Chimaera going at Endor and Executor at Fondor with Chiraneau pumping up the drains. You have 2 confrontational Jedi and some walkers to handle the ground.


You don’t really have to concern yourself with what your opponent does too much. You have solid power on the ground and solid power in space. There aren’t many deck match-ups that I fear with this deck.
