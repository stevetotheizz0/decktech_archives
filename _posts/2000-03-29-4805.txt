Strategy: 

First off, please give constructive criticisms when you review.

I always start Imperial Arrest Order for the ability to get docking bays and speed things up. The general idea is to get Vader and Tarkin to the D*:DB and Mara w/stick and Evazan to the Tatooine docking bay. Just peck away at the opponent with little drains and Visage. If the opponent comes to the Death Star, play Put All Sections on an important character, maybe Beat another character, Barrier someone, and commence beatdown. Duel if they bring Obi or Luke. If they bring someone to the Tatooine docking bay, Barrier the biggest threat, duel if Luke comes, and if you have You Are Beaten, take someone out.

VS. HBX
Set up your characters on ground like usual and do your damage. Try to guess the Hidden Base before you go out, and do probe and run missions. Choose your space battles and try to get maximum damage done there. Might be a tough matchup.

VS. HB Mains
Run your normal setup and try to do as much damage as possible on the ground before your opponent decides he's stocked enough force to bring a hit squad. Be prepared for ground battles with your tricks. If they flip, probe with Security Precautions out. Shouldn't be too hard in space with them playing less ships.

VS. Ops
Go down and clear some sites with your guys. Dengar works great here, with the big destinies. Try to prevent them from flipping. Remove Operatives from battle when you can. Do damage via Visage and drains. Don't forget Kashyyyk, too.

VS. Profit
Let them free Han early. Go down where they're weak and split up groups. Beat on the weaklings left behind. Duel Luke or Obi if you get a chance. Try to take over the big drain sites and inflict as much damage as possible. Work in drains at Kashyyyk.

VS. Mains & Toys
Duel Luke and Obi if you get the chance. Beat on lone characters. You can also avoid them and set up as usual. Wait for them to come to you and play your tricks. Might be tough, considering your smaller amount of characters.

I think that about covers the major deck types. If I missed anything, let me know. And again, please give only constructive criticism.
