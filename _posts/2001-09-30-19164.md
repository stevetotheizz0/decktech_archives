The Hyperdrive Generator’s Gone/We’ll Need A New One  '

Strategy: '

Start

The Hyperdrive Generator’s Gone/WNAN1, Credits Will Do Fine, Tatooine City Outskirts, Tatooine Watto’s Junkyard, Heading For The Medical Frigate for Another Pathetic Lifeform, Insurrection & Aim High, and Do, Or Do Not & Wise Advice


Strategy

Get set up in the Junkyard as quickly as possible (a risk against some decks, but generally a good move).  This will start you on the APL cycle, giving you a huge activation boost.  Fortify the Junkyard on your next few turns, but be careful not to overdeploy there; you can use it as a good trap to lull your opponent in for a battle and another stack on Credits.  When you’ve flipped, begin to make surgical strikes against your opponent, maximizing your retrieval from We’ll Need A New One.  Your character base, though currently limited, is enough to take on anything that comes out.  Continue to hold the Junkyard, as the direct damage of Credits will be a constant hindrance to your opponent.

Use of the Republic Cruiser should be confined to a lategame surprise, and only as long as you’re flipped.

The biggest problem this deck has is obviously Undercover spies.  Save your Sorry About The Mess combos to deal with them while still on the 0 side of your objective.  I’ve considered adding Wioslea (to ’purchase’ U-3PO and other annoying non-battle droids) and/or a Double Agent (since Lando is a prime candidate for getting to the Junkyard early).
