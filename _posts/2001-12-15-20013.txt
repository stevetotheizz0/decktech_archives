**Weekend Update**
this deck went undefeated at this weekends chase the cans tournament. beating my first opponent by 29 and winning by only 11 (with 20 cards in hand) to huntdown dueler.

ishi tibs are the coolest things ever.

my first turn usually consists of my putting someone in space and a palace raider at home one docking bay to generate me alot next turn.

card choices

2 celebrations? youll always get it, and if it gets cancelled, just play another, and if that gets cancelled, play effective repairs, and if it gets cancelled again, play repairs again, that is...if you havent retrieved the 1st one already. MUAHAHAHHAHAAHA

new hope houjix?
cancels sunsdown too cold for speeders combo which hurts really bad, and it cant be cancelled by Take Evasive Action

revolution should be in any WYS. people always leave random 2 ability guys at 1/0 docking bays because they arent afraid of spy beats...well...

goo nee tay x2 is a must nowadays

were you looking for me is awesome, it can retrieve 3po, go get him...geez, it rules.

effective repairs (shannon TECH) is awesome. a must

i only play 1 ooc/tt because it ALWAYS gets grabbed.

if your playing against dark deal or huntdown non-dueler, start menace fades. theyll give you enough force so you dont have to start staging areas.

pull kessel into your hand and keep it untill late game, especially if its a drain race. DONT deploy kessel for the 1st half of the game. with only 3 starships in the deck, it is key to hold tatooine for the 1st half, or untill you get everything set up.

the lack of control/tunnels is a major part of the deck that is missing in many people’s point of view. there are 2 reason i dont play this.

#1. its a 1 destiny. with the destiny numbers low on average in comparison to other WYS decks, the few 5 that would have to be taken out to put control/tunnel in are crucial.

#2. there are only 2 cards which are key in this deck. Ill take the leader (which i would recommend a 2nd of, its only missing it because i only own 1) and tatooine celebration. with 3po, mirax, and the 2 of them present in your deck, getting them wont be hard at all.
well, thats about it, have fun

to the post about the lacking of space platform. wedge forfeiting for 9 a turn to the bacta tank is pretty good. just grab the imperial command that let them fight you. the only thing that would suck would be tie laser cannons, but if that happens, i deploy kessel and run like a little girl. i still have on the edges and narshaddas to retrieve.
