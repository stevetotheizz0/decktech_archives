Strategy: 

This deck is not meant for ground.	The point of this deck is to drain the hell out of your opponent.  Against many different decks this deck can out drain them for sure, just watch out for Security Precautions, it hurts.  Imperial Decree doesn't hurt, how many people do you know put two rebel base locations in their dark side deck, not many.  Even if they do try to use the other part they have to occupy a system, how are they going to manage to do that?  This deck could probably improve with some of the DSII cards like Home One.
