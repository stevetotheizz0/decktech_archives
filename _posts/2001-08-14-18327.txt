I mainly decided to have a little more character variety and Weapon vs. HB.As a side effect the D’s get better:-)
Martin Falke is right, start Secret Plans instead of TPM.

------------------------------------------------------------
The main strategy is simple:
Flip, spread, drain and do beatdown or directdamage with your objective.
This objective isn´t too strong, but it is pretty fun to play.
Flipping is very easy.You can flip 1st turn in most games, but make sure to save a barrier or move with the second char. deployed over to Watto.
After that try to outdamage your opponent.

Card choices:

Destroyer Druids - They arre just good direct damage cards.They can shoot your opponent characters and make him lose cards.Also together with Switch Off! they won´t get hit.Deploy them to Watto´s Junkyard where no destiny can hurt them.

EPP Vader over others - I have no room for Vader´s stick and the destinies shouldn´t get lower as they actually are.Also he is the perfect weapon to kill EPP Obi or unarmed Ben with TCINC.
A builtin-weapon is just too good.

I think the other are pretty selfexplaining.If you have questions just d-mail me.

Matchups:

WYS - I just hate it.If the beatdown version is popular in your area then add this guy who cancels Beggar.Deploy him to the bridge where nobody can touch him.
Versus the podracing version add podracing stuff?
I have no clue podracing is not that popular in my area so I don´t do anything about it.
Just try to do enough early damage and you might have a chance but I dunno.
Also hide your ships at Carida when he has already deployed his somewhere else to avoid Battle Plan.
Try to use Maul and Destroyers for ground control.
If WYS is the main deck played in your area then better play the Choke Vaders over the others but be careful to track good destinies.
Also a second Guri wouldn´t hurt.

Rebel Strike Team - get Maul to Endor and let him kill some scrubby scouts.Epp Vader can be used in suicide runs in coombination with YAB, Sniper/DS and TCINC.
In this matchup you should try to outbattle him and if you do so you should win.

MWYHL - add Endor system and fly over with Maul and duel scrubby Yoda :-)

those are all I can think about at the moment.I haven´t tested this deck too much and I want some reviews.
