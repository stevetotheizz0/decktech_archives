Strategy: '

in this deck i can get EBO runing in 3 turns via 

ANSB and echo base garrison. then i deploy large

amounts of B-wings and see if my opponents space is 

of any danger then if it is i can re-enforce my 

fleet with stronger  more expensive deploying ships

like cruisers. I don’t have a large ground force

but my drains in space are big and i have force drain

cancellers and my dead guys can go to backta tank 

return next turn. in space battles i can get alot 

of extra power from EBO, aim high and concentrate 

all fire. i end the game with big drains after my 

opponents fleet is demolished.

reasons why i use commander luke- hew is a better 

pilot than most lukes, deploy0on R2-D2 in red5

i can pull him from reserve deck. his major default

is he is’nt very strong. Ion cannons- they are very

useful at stoping my opponent from running away,

they are destiny+3 on bombers=ionize then get easy

hit, they defend my bombers against SFS9.3 cannons 

and other guns. Bombers-ion destiny+3, can add pilot

if my opponent uses DS I’ll take the leader.
