Strategy: '

Put Sai'torr Kal Fas on Taws Khaa then give him the Lightsaber and Lightsaber Proficiency and if they battle him you get 3 destiny with Warrior's Courage and Solo Han.

Also S-Foils makes your X-wings better.

Traffic Control is my favorite card, there are 2 of them because that way you can just put the extra one back in your used pile since you only need one.

That is my deck good luck and I hope you do good with it.  '
