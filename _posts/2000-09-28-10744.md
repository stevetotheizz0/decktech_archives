Note there are two dungeons because the objective and the interrupt both call for one. I just lose one to force drain. '

Strategy: '

The strategy behind this deck is CONTROL JABBA’S PALACE Use it as your base of operations as you make surgical strikes against the opponent, depleting his life force while regenerating yours. Deploy Gailid, Mosep and Jabba to the AC to complete the force enhancement package. Gailid and Mosep for force draining and Jabba for activating. Use Bounty Hunters and ships to control all the sites you need to get a good force drain. If the opponent is using undercover spies, don’t get mad, just deploy bounty and WHAM Hutt Smooch. The opponent just helped you win. Remember, don’t be afraid to lose a lot of force. As long as their losing force too, you have Bounties on your side.

Strategies

Against Hidden Base
Play Deck as normal, but don’t, I repeat, Don’t engage in battle. Move your starships around to probe the systems but don’t battle. You should win.

Against TIGIH/ICSH
The opponent will have a Luke down so use BH with Dengar’s MRG and FT’s Stun Rifle and capture, take him to tatooine and retrieve force, Make pet food. Just Remember you gotta be quick or he’ll have too much backup to fight. Could be tough, But you should win.

Against EBO
Use people with landspeed of three to get in and out quickly. Only deploy a starships when your ready to pick up the captives. Like Hidden Base, Don’t engage them unless you have to. If you don’t make a mistake, you should win.

Against YCEPBT/OBD
Come on. They give you a han. Let’s feed him to da Rancor or take him to da Dungeon. You win.

Against RST/GD
Capture the Best Scouts and take to Tatooine. You may be able to use the systems to your advantage depending on how strong the opponents space game is. If they blow up the bunker, don’t worry about the force you lose. One Bounty completed and Your Back in the game. Piece o’ cake.

Against Subjugated Planet
Same as against RST/GD
