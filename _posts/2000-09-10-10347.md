Strategy: '

ok starategy section
start the hut it is a good twix site and ewoks dpleoy less there. Your Insight for close air support. Squadron assignemnts gets out Tala 1 and Colonel Cracken out in turn 2. Also i can get out calrissian w/ strike planning and get gold squadron 1 out for help.
Strike Planning I get crix madine very first turn. wait until u see what your opponent is playing and then see what u need. solo for ground or calrissian for space.
well lets see characters.
first turn after you get out madine get cok which lets u get out wuta. then for the following turns get out endor sites. w/ madine get col. cracken and kazak and your ewoks. ithorians for extra power w/ ewoks and put Threepio w/ lots of ewoks for back-up. Bargaining Table stops drains HOTJ if i really need it like really need it i'll get it but i dont see that happening. battle plan for heavy space or heavy ground and traffic control because i draw a lot so i can put osme of it back.
get Tala 1 out w/ crakcen out. dont put out tla 2 if tala 1 is there. save it if they leave
sabers for drains and the ao is cool cuz it adds to immunity and gen. solo gets to like 4 atrittion.
endor x2 cuz i need it out'
