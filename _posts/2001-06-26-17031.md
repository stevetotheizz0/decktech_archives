Response to reviews

Veretech- You think it LOOKS like cheese? The title has ’cheese’ in it and the heading to the strategy is ’Cheesiest deck in the world’  1 star w/o an explanation? Idiot.


The Cheesiest Deck in the World


Most matchups are pretty much the same.  When playin Imperials, beat them down w/ a herd of power 4 Eloms and stack.  Against Scum, drain on Endor and kill them w/ Odds and AFA damage.


BHBM is really easy since they barely ever beat you in a duel since you have massive destiny so they stack every duel and you can cross vader.  Try to make Odds go off ASAP so they lose 12 or so 1st turn. 


Most decks are unprepared for something this wacky and will have half their deck gone before they can do anything, just stay under 13 cards in hand, esp. if they play Crush to pull Monnok.  Trust me, it wins games fairly easily.  '
