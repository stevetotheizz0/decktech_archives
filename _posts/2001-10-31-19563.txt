Strategy: '

This is intended for a PRE-REFLECTIONS 3 ENVIRONMENT.  Unfortunately I do not think it will do too well in the post ref3 environment because of the availability of taking a grabber at will, podracer defensive shield, the new interrupts that causes un-piloted vehicles to be lost and the new DS objective.  It could still win, but would not be as fast, or win as by much.  

First off the most common response to this deck is what the hell were you smoking when you made this?  or what the f*** were you thinking???

Well believe it or not this deck actually wins.  I have yet to have it loose, it went 2-0 at this last weekends tourney, and 4-0 in playtesting.

The deck works the same against all decks  First turn, drop Naked Threepeo, and draw. Second turn and beyond You use your messes* early game to cycle thorough your deck getting locations and key effects such as incom, flaps, dtf, and savrip.  It won*t kill you if your mess gets grabbed, because it is only necessary in the first few turns to get your locations and effects out, it is nice to use in mid to late game to cycle through your deck grabbing speeders to beat down with.   You draw your race destinies, usually winning (I lost the race during a tourney, and still won by 15J) and soon as the race is over, you spread out on Tatooine and drain and beat down with your speeders.  Somewhere in the middle of all of this, as long as they aren*t playing the odds canceller or huge destiny characters, drop odds in their deck.  You have a minimum total of 9 with artoo and 3p0.  It*s nice to have Mirax or the Lars family out, but it is not necessary.

The beauty of this deck is the many forms of damage and retrieval that it can get going SUCCESSFULLY.  I ended 4 of the 6 games that it has played with no lost pile.  This deck is capable of winning constantly against a wide variety of decks.

Here is the break down of the damage
6 from the race.  As I said earlier, I have only lost one race.
6 minimum from odds.
Drains/Beats, if the opponent leaves me alone and doesn*t deploy, just drop your speeders to your sites, set up flaps/incom, and just sit there.  Use Savrip if they drop too many guys to battle you.  I was playing against an AOBS, and my opponent had Xizor, Vigo, Fett with Gun, and Guri at a site.  I had a 12 card hand, activate flaps, already have incom down drop 5 speeders, mess, drop 3 more, mess drop 1 more, 3p0, drop 1 more.  That*s 10 speeders, at a minimum of 5 power (6 if they are sandspeeders) Battle, retrieve one, he looses one.  I draw a 5 for destiny, he looses a sht load.  Basically game over for him.
There is simply too much going on in this deck for the opponent to cope with, let alone attempt their own strategy.  It is just very versatile.

Retrival
Podrace 6
DTF  1 every time you battle
Harvest  4 When the Lars family comes out to play
I Did It  4 Thanks Ani,  you kicked Sebulbas @ss

Vs Mauls Throne deck and Watto objective
Wait for him to deploy Maul/Watto, then build up your hand, to get 10-12 cards, with a mess, and let the speeders pay the dark lord or junk dealer a visit.  It will cause enough overflow damage that they will be crippled enough.  Play odds, win the race, spread out on Tatooine, use T-47 Battle Formation, before you know it they have no cards left.

Vs Space Deck
This won by 22 against a tie deck believe it or not.  I set up on Tatooine as soon as I knew that he was going ties, and use your T-47 Battle Formations to increase your drains, and play smart watching out for beat downs.  Use harvests to retrieve when necessary, and insert odds if possible.

Weaknesses
I see no major ones, as this is intended for a PRE-REFLECTIONS 3 Environment.  Unfortunately I do not think it will do too well in the post ref3 environment because of the availability of taking a grabber at will, podracer defensive shield, the new interrupts that causes un-piloted vehicles to be lost and the new DS objective.  It could still win, but would not be as fast, or as by much.  

Search and Destroy  If the opponent is stupid enough to set this up using characters at exterior sites, they will get the crap beat out of them by the mass of wb ghetto speeders.  If they set it up using characters at interior battle grounds, then try your best to get the Lars family or Mirax out with your speeders.

Monnok  it hurts, but you can recover just fine with the ridiculous amount of retrieval in there.  Harvest, race, battle, take your pick.

SAC  I had the anti-sac combo card in here originally, but found that the opponent could only keep a character on the ground to use sac effectively was BHBM.  And sac won*t hurt that much as you can retrieve and beat the crap out of lonely Vader who thinks he*s all that.

Too Cold for Speeders combo card - Nobody plays this crap... it has no use but against speeder decks which are forgoten.  I mean, when is the last time you have had this card in your deck?

Grabber - They will hurt, but just don’t let them save up the 3 force to use it against you.  If they have the force saved, then don’t play messes durring your turn.  

Cool Cards that work nice in the deck
T-47 Battle Formation  Drains are +1 at each site that you control (if your speeders occupy 3 battle grounds on the same planet)  Cancel a drain at a site adjacent to a location your speeder occupies.  Yup, it*s a great card for this deck as I use lots of speeders.

Numbers, Artoo, and Threepo with his clothes off  Well with my starting effect, both are able to deploy from reserve, giving me a total of 9 for numbers.  Play numbers if you can, even if you can only get 3 or 4 damage, it is great for the actual damage as well as the physiological damage.  Numbers just plain pisses people off, and makes em worry like hell.

Sandspeeder  Even though they are the destiny 1*s in the deck, they have their advantages when compared to the Rebel speeders.  They*re able to react, and also have 1 more power.  But most importantly they can react to a battle or drain.

The bottom line is, just play smart.  This deck is super-flexible and won by 15 and 30 in this Saturday*s tourney to help me go undefeated.

Thanks for reading, and please remember that this is a PRE-Reflections 3 deck.  And also no bone head reviews like it has too much in it  or this deck is dumb  People who write these types of reviews are to simple minded to play a deck that takes patience, concentration, and careful planning to play.
