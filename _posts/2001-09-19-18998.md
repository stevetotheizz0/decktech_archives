Strategy: '

As I stated in the Intro, I try to flip and drain at Kessel, Kiffix and Naboo. The reason there are so many planets in here is I see way to many security precautions, and the greater number help ease the loss when they find my base.  Corran Horn is in because I needed a ability 4 non Skywalker pilot to go against Maul in his ship, Especially against Hunt Down.  This deck can hold it’s own against space decks, be Tie or Star Destroyers due to the variety of weapons.  The deck I am having the most problems with is Dark side Senate. Any suggestion to improve this would be great. '
