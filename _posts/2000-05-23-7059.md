This is an old No Shelter deck modified to fit today's meta. Utilizes the TR start for a first turn start, high activation, and little force for opponent. The main strategy for this deck is simple. Go wherever your opponent is and battle them with DTF/FA. This deck contains the usual mains complement. For space, use Han with Chewie/Wedge in the Falcon, which should allow you to maintain presence up there. Interrupts are mainly for good measure. The usual SAC, DFTD vs. Numbers, COAS for dueling (also a few high destinies). Even with Crush, Clash Of Sabers can still be used. Nabrun's for jumping around, which you'll need to do a lot with this deck (once again even with IAO, Nabrun is still useful). Sorry About The Mess helps with beatdown. The effects are pretty self-explanatory, except for the 5 Revos. I tried to regulate my Revolutions; normal TR mains uses 3, and there are the rogue decks out there which use 7, I on the other hand chose a number between the two. WAYTTPOU grabs Evaders, and if they play one early on, with the amount of force you're retrieving with DTF, you'll be able to get your revos back. I love this deck, basically because it's universal, and can take on just about anything with an equal chance of winning each time. Drop and kick @$$

Note In case you didn't realize, when playing a deck which plays heavy space (e.g SFS/TIEs) play revo on your twix sites, and since TIE decks usually don't play Evaders, drain away.

Enjoy. '
