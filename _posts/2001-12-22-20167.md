Strategy: '

Well the deck is Podraced based But can deal with the losing of the podrace like I said the shield pulling is what the deck is about.


First i know begger is dead but look they use 2 shield first come here u big coward the drain and retrivel.then  the racing shield. But thats only one left they always pull the grabber or the plans shields. so begger is now tech.



Ok Game play keep luke in the hut until u get either some stopper card or some charater back up. U get 6 force right of the bat and with the opponent giving u know 2 to 4 icons u get epp beats down first turn to start stacking cards.


With this deck i always control 2 to 3 battle grounds. It rules when they dont come to kessel and u drain for 3 each turn. 


Yeah the shield i almost froget


wise

Ultimatum

onee ta

He can go about his bisnass

Do or do not

a close race

Aim High

Grabber


Anyways the deck is hit and run drain and just win deck


I dont care for the stragety really the deck has gone a total of 15-2 in turney play 



Match ups


Hunt down bad game for the deck the only 2 loses to the deck because i had to play some hardcore guy really good solid huntdown but it was only by 2 when i had 3 cards stack and pull a 5.



Others u can deal with because u can just hit and run while ur destiny adders are built in and just draw like 2 to 3 destiny and battle while drawing above a 4 most of the time if u can track ur deck and not depend on luck.

Thats why I also pack Colo Claw Fish awsome tech.



While i just like to have fun with the decks i make while winning i agree that yeah epps are not as great as they once were but hell just have fun the new stuff cant handle the old school ways.


Well peace 

I know my words are jumbled but hell thats disgrapha for yeah.

If u want to rip on me d mail me or aim me
