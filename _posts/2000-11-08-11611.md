Strategy: '

This is the corrected version of you lost in 5 min. deck
Please take the time to read my strategy before reviewing.

First turn
Start goo nee tay
It’s a killer card against unexpected decks and high ability decks.
This way , you will also be protected against Onith decks.
Try to deploy Luke and look in your deck for Bo Shuda ( Just to see what is in your force pile)
and draw a bit

*How to win and why some cards are in this deck i will explain now 


1)Why all the red??
 ------------------
Most decks can’t handle a lot of interrupts and effects .The interrupts are handy .In this deck you can make opponents Vehicles crash , kill caracters during your control f. ,make opponents characters missing ,put your characters in bacta so they are ready for battle next turn and so on...

The big duel pakkage included will ensure a nice duel in your favor.I’ve you wouldn’t be ready for a duel , sense the duel and allow your opponent later when your ready for him.

How to win vs space decks
-------------------------
You have the opportunity to look trough your deck every turn searching for Bo Shuda
Use it
Track your senses (they could cancel for example their short range fighters using it to search for a tie) , it could be worse (to stop heavy ds2 losses or to stop a heavy drain from Endor Ops)and most important of all ,your light version of search and destroy.Flip as soon you think you have either 10 force loss or you want him to dammage him real quick.
Use your help me obi one wise , as it provides you with a big suprise.
*itimidate your opponent by pretending you have something wich will meke him loose
and most of all  track , track , track.
Sooner or later they might come on ground and
you could be sitting ducks...

VS. huntdown and other dueling
------------------------------
Track , make them loose their duel and win.
if they use sim aloo,and they leave the card ,You’ll know it is a low destiny giving you the opportunity to sense and alter with now problem.
Try to be carefull at batteling the great Emperor , because you never now a lightening bolt will hit your character.

Raltirr  Never think i’ll see this deck again , unless they want to die against the great amount of deck playing with dunsed thaa.

Court  drain , battle , win.
Klantooines will help you with delight when they see a hutt can be killed .

No disintigrations  use it 
every battle , send a character of ability >2 to bacta , or to revive and make opponent lose three force.They’ll sure wont enjoy deploying vaders ,
or they’ll run out of bounty hunters in now time.



Little story 
--------------
(Don’t read it if you don’t have much time or simply are not interrested)

*How i’ve beaten huntdown in 5 min (with luck)
----------------------------------------------
first turn 
he deployes mara and onith as a starter. I deploy lando and luke and saber
Send Mara to hand , battle destiny 10 ;
onith forfeit 0 , he loose 19 first turn
After that he duels I play glancing , he was totaly defeated at that time.
(11th of belgium , before the tourney 8th)



Thanx for reading,
forgive my spelling ,
i hope it can provide you with
the neccecary wins during a tourney.
