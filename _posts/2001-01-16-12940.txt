Strategy: '

		   This deck uses a variety of bounty hunters to capture opponents characters.
		  Use LV and Mara with sabers with All Too Easy to freeze, using HFZ to pull the sabers if neccesary, and cause massive
		  damage after the objective is flipped.
		  All Wrapped Up is used for many captures, which can be taken advantage of
		  with Bounty.
		  Another trick with All Too Easy that I think will work is if your opponent has someone with a saber in the chamber while you have a captive there, and hits the escort, Human Shield the hit, then All Too Easy the captive.	I’m not sure if this would work, but it would be nice.

		  Against other decks
		  TIGIH Put a Bounty on Luke and take a hunter and an Imperial to his location, automatically
		  capturing him. Then hold him in the Security Tower.
		  HB Mains Once they flip, use the Hunters in ships to probe, and use ground
		  hunters for a beatdown.
		  HB Swarm Mass your ships and attack them, using SFS cannons to destroyy
		  the lead ships.
		  QMC get characters and Dark Deal out as fast as you can and take their
		  characters out before they cancel it.
		  Ground decks if necessary, send hunters to other planets to capture and beat down, sending Lord Vader if you need to.
		  Space Decks	Hit your opponent hard with BH ships and super-Chimaera(Chimaera piloted by Thrawn and Pellaeon).  Leave the Obsidians at Cloud City for safety, though. '
