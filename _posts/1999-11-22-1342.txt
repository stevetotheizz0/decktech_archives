Strategy: '

Okay, sure activation early sucks.	I got in some extra DB's to help counter that.  After a few turns, the activation get's rolling, and I can starrt churning out the walkers and Ships.  I can set up on hoth, send out an ice storm, do some base occupation, establish my garrison, all the while decreeing that your deck is weak and whimpy.

(the above text was riddled with a play on words, don't take to seriously.)

Responsibility on ben turn 1, woohoo	no battle or drain for you  Or a Luke in space at kessel.  Nope, don't think so

Have a great day guys

I'd just like to add, some Canadians Suck

How did they come up with canadas spelling?

No offense to all the cool northerners.'
