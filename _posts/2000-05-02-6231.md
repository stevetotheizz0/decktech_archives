Strategy: '

General strategy
----------------
Get out your nudj and try to put a mains to
play your sense if needed.
Try to get out CCity as soon as possible to drain
and play nasty interrupts.

Some cards
----------
Saber + ccity sites + pucumyr + proficiency
-> huge drains 
You can get sabers with SoS and weapon levitation
(also cancel You are beaten).

If you can put Yoda on Dagobah, characters
on CCity are very strong 

Yoxgit deploy for free and retrieve the green cards.
Sabers, landing claw to cancel drains, Xwing cannon
for Zuckuss, Fett, ...

Use Smoke screen against Vader + Tarkin.
Nabrun and Path to battle everywhere.

Use bacta and docking repair to recycle
your characters and starchips. Use also the savrip
to stay on table. Use Order to engage when
appropriate and dont forget to retrieve with the edges.

Suggestions needed. '
