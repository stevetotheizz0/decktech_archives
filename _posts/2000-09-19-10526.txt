Strategy: 

*there shouldn’t be 2 furthers in the title I just messed up and didn’t check

The objective stops opponent from modifying your drains when it is flipped.

Drains are the story of this deck.  I use Dark deal, overseeing it, cloud city occupation, and we’re in attack position now to cause big force loses.  I use the docking bays to get force and be able to get a fast start.  I never put down bespin: cloud city until I am ready to play dark deal.  i pull the Executor using Mobilization Points.  I use imperial commands to get out my generals and admirals and use Piett to get Commadner Igar usualy.

vs Hidden Base-Hidden base is the main weakness of this deck because they cancel drains and it is hard to control the system to use occupation and We’re in Attack position now.	Try to probe fast and stop them from canceling drains.	A good hidden base should win but with luck you can probe and get in some huge drains late.  I f you win it won’t be by much.

vs Training-use CC occupation to make them loses force and pump up that loses with we’re in attack position now.	If you get going fast this game should be no problem.

vs Profit- out drain them!  If they go to try a beatdown on cloud city use imperial command. To either add a destiny to get rid of charcters or limit them to 1 to keep your characters around.

vs TIGIH- get out dark deal and get +4 in battles on cloud city and crush the rebellian will limit their destinies.  Stop them from winning battles and drain to death.
