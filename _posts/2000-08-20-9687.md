Strategy: '

**Note, i forgot to type in alderaan, i accidentily put in ord mantell, just swap it with alderaan, thanks**
edit Ok, the idea of this deck was taken from dawi's deck, so props to him. but i completely revised it. just about the only things that stayed were the senses, alters and m'iiyooms, so dont hose it now onto the strat

Basically, use mob points to get some good activation when you use the DSDocking Control Room to get the DBs. try and get merrejk and chiraneau out asap. use merrejk to draw the systems, and chiraneau to drain like mad. that is why i have so many SDs, so i can be sure to draw them.

SCANNING CREW IS NOT DEAD. "insight will kill you blah blah blah" well, everytime i played, people ditch insight for honor of the jedi, and if they ditch it, screws are very much alive. and even if they dont, the SCrews arent that key to the deck, so relax

use m'iiyoom to kill there mains and unique characters from hand. use the screws to keep the female rebs out of their hand. use AAA and search and destroy to make them lose force since they wont be able to deploy with no one in their hand because of m'iilyoom and screws (stick m'iiyoom on the DS, since you dont take any battle damage on there, and with 4 of her in the deck, what does it matter if you lose her?) i know that they can still D ships to combat AAA, but my SDs should rock them good.

keep control of the systems and just drain. it works fine. jedi test #1 hurts, and so does menace fades, but they can be overcome, espically menace fades. if they do train and get test one complete, just drain without the adders, it will still hurt them.

just sense and alter everything.all the vaders and mara should allow you to draw one of them early on, so get them down asap.

use boring convo and point man to cancel those cards that hurt so much.

please dont give me a half star and tell me this deck sucks. give it a decent rating, and some input on what it needs (what cards to pull, what to throw in, etc etc) saying it sucks doesnt help me, you or anyone. so just help my out, and give me some pointers. i know that many of you said to pull out the characters, please tell me which to pull. i cant read your mind, you have to tell me what sucks, and what to replace it with. thanks...
