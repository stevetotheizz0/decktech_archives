Strategy: 

it’s fun...and if you have anything to say, well...it’s ralltir and it’s guaranteed to win like at least 50% of the time.

there’s a small eyeball creature that watches you from your closet while you’re sleeping.  if you start to wake up it will run away.	sometimes while you are in a deep sleep it will crawl up to you and try and get into your mouth.  it will try and lay it’s eggs in there...soon you will have parasitic eyeball creatures growing in your throat...and the eyebally guy will sit and watch you slee until his kids hatch in your throat.
