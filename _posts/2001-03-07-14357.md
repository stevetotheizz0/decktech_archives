Strategy: '

 
edit The Basics The first thing which this deck does is trick your opponent into thinking

youare playing an old school QMC. So they either come down to try and stop you and

youkill them with your mains or you go to them and beat them down. Unlike other

mainsdecks this deck can drain for up to 8 or 9 per turn while retrieving 3 per turn. Your

shipscan tke care of space and your mains can take care of the ground. This deck is well

balanced and if played right it can win almost any game.


Starting the Game Your Start with Bespin, Quest Quarters. And Usually Squadron Assignments, Staging Areas, and Insurrection


Begin the game by pulling the Home One Docking bay and the Cloud City Carbonite Chamber. Deply them and then on the next turn Deploy Bespin Clod City. Try to get the Super falcon their and if their are deploying drain sites save your men for a beatdown, but if it look like there playing all space get your drains and retival set up. Beatthem down if you can. Try not to be to careless with your mains there not invicible.


Use order to engage and SAC to battle like a champ. If you play smart and never give up you can win almost any game.


Cards


Dash + Outrider is a great ship to win you battles in space or just contol the sector. You can also use dash on the ground if really needed. You can always get this combo if you have one of the two by using Squad. Assign.


Ill Take the Leader This is a wondeful card it is great for combating ties and BH in Ships. You get +1 drains at your docking bays and your ships are immune to attrition <4 or add two to their immunity.


The Matchups


Manipulation


Drop your chracters as soon as possible and drain. Beat him down if he tries to battle. Set up your retrival and Sense his tricks. Play smart and you can overpower him.


Tie Swarm Use the super falcon + Order to Engage + Your Other Ships + SAC + Punch It + Ill Take the leader to beat them down and cancel SFS. Use battle plan to stow their drains. If they go anywhere on the ground use your fallen portals and beat them down. use Hasshn against Lateral Damage. If you play it right this game should be yours.


Endor Ops Like the ties except watch for Thrawn on the Chimera. Invade the bunker and cancel OM. Rm. This game is a sinch if you execute it right.

Just drain, Retieve, Beatdown, and Win. Simple


BHBM Star wise advice insted of Staging Areas to stop their SAC attack. Use your mains to beat them down. Drain and Retrieve. Blow him away if he comes to space. This is one of this decks toughest matchups.


Hunt DownIf luke gets dueled use Courage and SAC and Tracking. Start as usual and Keep Luke + Obi away from Vader. Drain and Retrieve and Sense and alter what you can. Beathem down where you can and the direct Damage should tkae them out. Use order to engae in space and Fallen portals on the ground. Tough, but possible.


ISB Start Menace and get blount to flip their objective back. Kill their Agents and Their Ships beatthem down and drain and Retrieve. Not to much of a hassle, but watch yourself.


TDIGWATT Choke his force early and beatdown his character. Dont let hm ake control of Clod City. Use the Super Falcon and Home One to destroy him in space. Drain and Retrieve. Carefull for trooper beatdowns sense their tricks. And you should be fine.


Court Get to the Court and tear him up sense his tricks and retieve and Drain. Watch for the Hunters and You should be able to take contol fairly easy. Dont let them battle you with S & V. If they dont occupy three Jabbas sites alter S & V. Your direct damage and Retrieval wil Kill them.


MKOS Pretty Much the same, buit dont forget to choke their force. And beathem down if they come to space.


Thank for your time. I hope you like it.

Please think before giving this deck a bad review.  '
