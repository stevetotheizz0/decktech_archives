Strategy: '

First off this is not an operative deck, and is not designed to flip. I start Local Uprising, Endor, and Farm and Strike Planning so that my opponent only activates 1 force from me and I get 4, plus a drain of 1 at Endor.

First turn, before I activate, I pull General Cal with Strike Planning, then activate. Then I search for his ship and deploy GS1 and GenCal to Endor. If they are playing RalOps, I move them over to Raltiir to prevent the flip. Or if the opponent is playing any other system that I can drain at for more that 1, I will move over there. Other wise I stay at Endor. I also deploy the Jungle to Endor this turn.

My strat is simple verses all deck types, if the opponent is playing space, I set up drains on the ground, and beatdown in the air. If they are playing ground, I set up drains in the air, and beatdown on the ground. Not complicated at all. My only concern is that I don't have enough ships and no form of retrieval. Any ideas for retrieval would be appreciated.

Changes since last version
Took out BoShek, Courscant, Elom x2
Swapped Your Insights Serve You Well for Wise Advice
Added Battle Plan, Don't Get Cocky, Rug Hug, Liberty

Card explanations

Wise Advice My grabbers can deploy for free and if my interrupts get sensed they go to used pile.

Out of Commission Destiny 5 recycler, good game text, catches a Vader or Mara once and a while. Kill's tie retrieval decks, I know cuz I've got one.


Should I take out some systems in favor of some more sites? Or put in more ships, if so what should I take out???  I also need some form of reterival, but I'm not sure what to use.

Thanks for reviewing
