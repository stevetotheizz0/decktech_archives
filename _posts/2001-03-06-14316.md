*****UPDATES*****

In response to Bigzz’s review...actually on EPP Leia’s game text, it says @Leia’s Blaster Rifle, which in turn makes it unique...right?

*****************


This whole profit deal is great when you have many mains. 

I do have a lot of mains, more than anyone that I know, however I dont know how to play them as well as I could.  I really do need some suggestions with card playing/combos that would work well in this sorta deck.


Card Explanations...


Obviously the character selection is pretty good, even I can see that.  However, I would trade Obi-Wan Kenobi for another Ben Kenobi.  And I do like spys...and I know that some of you might think, Bothan Spy?  I know, I know, but I dont know what to replace it with.  Is Momaw Nadon worth being in there?  The Artoo/Gift combo kicks royal butt and hasnt been stopped yet. (Yes, I know it can be Snipped and Lt. Pol Tridium can stop it, but it still hasnt happened)  Also, I have two EPP Leias in there because I have found that it is hard to release Han without 3 Leias...


Effects and Locations are self-explanitory I think, but the Leias Blasting Rifle is a question, I know.  With two EPP Leias in there, why did I put that in?  I dunno honestly, I would like to replace it with a saber if I could...


And, I also think that all of the interrupts are good, are they?


VS Various Decks...


Hunt Down...

You can either use Undercover Spys or Transmission Terminated to cancel Visage.  Usually a close battle, but let them come to you...keep your focus on releasing Han.


Space...

Its a drain war, with no space in this deck, you have to drain better on the ground, which means flipping ASAP...if you cant or just plain get-stuck...game over


Court...

This is a fun game to play, I have usually come out on top because of nice interrupts in here, like Swing and a Miss, and destiny adders.  But the key in any game is to stick to your game.



Any suggestions or card replacements are welcomed, thank you  '
