Strategy: '

this is my first attemped at a deck science orgins and i dont have much rf3 and have not put in a lot of theed but it does not need it because it is undefeated in casuel play but soon i will take it to a locle and see how it stands.

First turn. activate deploy the ds site from deck check for m’iioom. if there is only 2 or draw until u get her unless the is one in hand. then deploy her.

slam ur oppents a cupple of times w/ onithes date machine then start saving force then when they attack her deploy a beat down squad and knock the living day lights out of your oppenet.

if they dont come to her then once they deploy go to them. and use ellis to go to a nother if you did not finish her/him. 

i must admit i have had trouble w/ space decks and almost lost to one. all i had was the executer. but i some how mannaged to win. so i put in the bounty ships and droped the exacuter and it still had trouble so i also threw in the exucuter. and it fares well. a real nice solid space deck that has no chacters go to ground will spanck this probbly.

stragty
pull i have u nows and monnoks w/ crush.
w/ blizzard 4 pull vader w/ stick if he is already there then pull moff.
make sure not to ove activate bucause w/ the i have u knows and the wepons u will also need denesties.
depoly all ur sites for force it works like a pile. if you dont know wut a pile is refear to hayese brillent pile.

remeber this is a deck that a player built that has been out of for a wile. and i will return the favor. 

i put talven korrey in the to stop light side piles and free power is good. '
