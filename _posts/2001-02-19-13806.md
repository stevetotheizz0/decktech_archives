Strategy: '

ok here is the lowdown 1st turn it matters on ur hand if u have a ship like pulsar skate or mirax grab and deploy kessel then whatever ship and person u have to kessel and deploy home 1 db from rd next turn FD for a big fat hairy 3 deploy corrilla and spaceport db to kessel if u have fallen portal drop 2 smugglers to spaceport and try to get your AO and bacta tank then u have a enginbe because if they fight u in space just lose guy to bacta and ship to DB isn’t that just skippy lol then just sit there and FD and spread out to tat db if ur set up enough and the destinys are huge in here and are a breeze to track with mirax then late game u use ur on the edges 4 times to retrive massive force now for match up


HDADTJ

be careful for dueling make sure u have Run luke run most likely u will have a ooc/tt by ur 3rd turn with TV/controls and so on so visage will barely hurt u and with run luke run u can use it twice once from hand once from lost and if he thinks he will stick vader at the cantina w a saber and drain all game they got another thing comming use talon to see what his top card is or track a 6 your self w mirax and cantina brawl that mofo i have done it 5 times its halirous seeing their face when a scrub kills the big man lol just FD should be easy game


BHBM

try to keep luke away for awhile use him for beats and such try not to stack cards and use bith shuffle to screw his tracking and begger to use his force to kill the barriers and such just sit at kessel and DB and FD to death do same thing to vader if he goes to cantina


MKOS

this is one of the few decks that has beat my WYS but i fixed why i lost i added in strike force which for the most part occuply a battleground site he cant cancel ur FD’s in space awesome card just use fallen portal and start aim high both hurts alot play lengendary starfighter on falcon if u can if he does a hit and run


Court

this is a little bit harder of a match up since ZiMH is a jizz sucking whore save 1 or 2 force each time to make them think u have a barrier kill a ship and try to ooc it then u don’t have to worry about it comming back same as mkos just much more annoying in space


Big Blue anything stay at kessel and DB’s maybe go to cantina if u feel it is safe imp command is damn annoying but my destiny in here is sick so u should be alright be careful of lateral damage and play it safe


well thats pretty much 90% of what people play by me against FD deck meance fades will screw them and ur retirveal will help alot any suggestions will be very helpful thanks alot this deck is like 40-3 hasd been 20-0 since i have tweaked it and undeafted in tourny play
