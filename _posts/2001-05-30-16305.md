Strategy: '

                  I know some of you will ask, "Why not SYCFA?" The reason I am not using it

                  is that in most cases, it doesnt hurt your opponent if you blow up Alderaan,

                  and I dont want my targeting to be limited to Alderaan, Yavin, Hoth, and a

                  Subjugated planet. 


                  Put Maul with some of your opponents scrubs at a Death Star site. Unless

                  there is an ability 4 character there, your opponent wont have presence. Also,

                  if Obi is on the table, use Mauls dueling to take him down for ADLR. 

                  Put Ephant Mon and your Death Star Gunners at the Conference room. The

                  gunners will add 2 to CPI, and Ephant will add 1 from your text at the

                  conference room. Also, your opponent wont be able to drop a spy for presence

                  for a beatdown crew. If you have Retract the Bridge in hand, you can also

                  reorganize the sites to keep your opponents characters away. 

                  Get the droid out to speed up your deck as much as you can. 


                  Matchups 

                  Any Single Planet deck (except EBO and MBO) Blow away the planet either

                  before or after getting ADLR out. Use your forces to pick up the stragglers. 

                  Space decks You will want to rely on more retrieval and your Destroyers.

                  Getting out the EBH ships as soon as you can will help a lot as well. 

                  EBO Hit Hoth with the Superlaser ASAP. That will kill any major strategy, and

                  just leave you dealing with a standard space deck. 

                  MBO Be very careful, and drop your dark jedi and Mara to Yavin to try and

                  keep your opponent from flipping. If they succeed, get Fel, his ship, and the

                  TIE cannon out to kill any attack runners.  '
