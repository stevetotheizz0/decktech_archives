Strategy: 

Start off by using the Audience Chamber to
deploy Chall Bekan from my reserve deck, and get
Scum And Villainy out asap to speed up my
deployment. There are plent of capture cards in
the deck, so it really isn't hard to capture any
characters. There are also a variety of high
destiny cards that can be used in certain
circumstances (ie; Torture, Masterful Move). The
Ghhhk is in there just in case things go really
wrong, and you can also pull that from your deck
with Masterful Move. After you've captured a few
characters and the objective is flipped, focus on
making your opponent lose force en masse with
Tatooine Occupation and your characters spread
out. This is really fun if you've been able to
capture one or two of your opponent's mains,
because he won't be able to fend off too many
characters, and you also have force retrieval from
Scum And Villainy, bringing all of your lost
characters back.
