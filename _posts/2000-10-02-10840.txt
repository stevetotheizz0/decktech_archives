Strategy: '

Okay, now for the fun stuff. This deck is all about gambling. You can take your time setting up Dark Deal, all the while gambling with Sabacc. Get Lando and Lobot out at the casino ASAP (Lobot should be no problem, because you can pull him with A Real Hero), preferably aboard one of the AT-AT’s to protect them from weapons fire. Keep your opponent away with A Real Hero (lets your Lando add 2 () battle destinies in ANY battle), and keep retrieving force. Try to get R2-Q2 on the AT-AT as well- during your draw phase, scan the top three cards of your deck so you know how your gambling will go It’s legalized cheating (Question for you smart people out there Can R2-Q2’s ability be used more than once? It doesn’t say "Once per turn" on the card.) Basically, you can set up Dark Deal at your own pace, then pound the snt out of your opponent.

Now, this is just a preliminary deck, and I have a few dilemmas. Most importantly, should I instead start with Any Methods Necessary? It will let me start with a bounty hunter and ship, but more importantly, it lets me get the prison right away, which means first turn Disco Lando if I don’t get him in my hand, plus it gives him a place to hide for a while. This is most important against decks that get him on the first turn with Strike Planning, but should I do this. Please let me know what you think. Anyway, thanks for your time. And remember, KEEP DISCO EVIL. '
