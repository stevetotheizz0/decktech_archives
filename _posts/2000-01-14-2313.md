Strategy: '

First off id like to say that the I Have You Now's and Dark Jedi Presence may make the deck look outdated, they are the main cards in this deck and provide the massive beatdown that helped me win 10 out of 12 at my last 4 tourneys. I would like some help on removing a few cards because everything is useful. the Crush The Rebellion Helps the I Have You Nows and Evaders. Empires New Order and Battle Order are in there to greatly hamper operatives as i kill them and retrieve. against hiiden base there is security precautions, and for some good drains the pof's provide useful. I dont have SAC, but it has proved to not really need it. Mind What you have learned is probably the touphest opponent and it is the one that this deck has lost the two games too. in space this deck also has some good power and some easy deployment at coruscant. In the end it usually wins by 15 or more and it is because of visage and drains. '
