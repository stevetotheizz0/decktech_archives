Strategy: '

first off i am going to add another boussh or epp leia when i get her and take out the leias backs they are just fillins right know. the whole strategy is to free han right away even if you dont have 5 or 10 force just get him out asap. then just get tesek loje nella to the AC and drain away with the fans. i start with uh oh so imperials are deploy +2 and that way when i get bo shuda out using the AC it cant be canceled.
