FEEDBACK

How many times do I have to defend my Darwin bless trademark? I didnt post my religious preference for your critique. This is Star Wars deck, so Id appreciate it if you reviewed it accordingly. And for the record, me representing my advocation for science in the form of a closing line on a CCG site is not dissing anyones religon any more than someone wearing clothing with the words WWJD is dissing non-Christian religons. Thats called expressing ones beliefs, its not bashing those of others. And finally, those who dock stars for the aforementioned trademark  will have their review deleted using their own tech points. Thanks

Mr. Cheese Id be interested in listening to you explain how WYS rapes this deck instead of just telling me that it does. 

Luca Historically, Profit has been a relatively easy matchup for HDADTJ. Six Force at the start means a potential first-turn Vader and quick damage, which is devastating if they have a lackluster opening hand. If I were to face Profit with this deck, Id probably send a crew into the AC after Han, and use Stunning Leader to fend off any retaliatory strikes. I believe that the battling resources of this deck are a bit superior than those of the average Profit deck, and typically thats what seperates the winner from the loser in mains vs. mains matchups. 

Bean2213 There are two battleground sites in the deck (the Death Star and Blockade Flagship DBs). 

Hayes Im thinking of cutting the MM combo and Ghhhk and adding Ghhhk combo x2 for Dodge/Patrol Craft protection, not to mention defense against Senate, etc. Youre a smart lad. Heh.

END FEEDBACK 

In its current form, this deck has lost one game for me since it was built, and that was to Brian Hunters WYS in the Houston DPC final. Props to Hayes Hunter, Jeremy Losee, Paul Myers, and Brian for advice with it along the way. 

Its Hunt Down. You should know how to play it. This version works best by getting a quick Vader down to pressure them into coming after him, cancelling the battle, then retaliating with unbridled fury. In almost every game I play with this deck, I cause 10+ overflow battle damage at one point or another, and its not difficult to do. You always start IAO & Secret Plans (aka the best card in STAR WARS...hehe) and YCHF & Mobilization Points. The third effect depends on what youre going up against, which I will elaborate on in the matchups section. 

At the start of the game, your primary objective is of course to get Vader down as quickly as possible in order to make Visage an immediate problem for your opponent. You want to try to throw them off their gameplan by causing so much damage that it cannot be ignored. Then, you deflect their offensive and spring your trap into action by dropping crippling beatdowns. A fairly simple concept, eh?
