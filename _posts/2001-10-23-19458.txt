Strategy:
You begin with the Normal WYS stuff. You start podracing. Once you win the Podrace, get I Did it out, and use it to retreive. Hold down Tatooine and keep Celebration out. This allows for maximum retreival. Here is how the first few turns should run:
First Turn: Use Insurrection to get Endor: Docking Bay {if you have Catipults and/or an ASP Droid, if not, go for the <> Spaceport Docking Bay}. 
Second Turn: Continue to podrace. 
Third Turn: If need be use A Step Backward to help yourself in the race.
Fourth Turn: You should have flipped by now.

Once you flip, set-up on the Tatooine locations, and use the retreival cards. Set up the Catipults on the Docking Bay with the ASP Droids. Use the Guraanteed 7’s that the Ewok Catipult/ASP Combo makes, for battles or On the Edge. 

Thanxs, and please give a fair review.










Strategy: 

Well, I accidently listed the Strategy with the Deck Cardlist, so, if you want to check the strategy go there, but I will attempt to add a little strategy here.

Problem decks for this deck:
All space decks. And Senate decks.

Attempt to try and ignore there strategy and set-yours up. Against the Space deck, try and get all your ships out first, and lock down on Tatooine, it should be enough to old the system, with the 7’s that will be popping up with the ASP/Catipult combo. Make sure you get the Falcon with Chewie and Han there with Karrde and Wedge as passangers. That way Chewie and Wedge {when the objective is flipped} is worth a total forfeiture of 12, and then they take a breif dip in the Tank and come back. 

Well, theres the strategy.

Please give me a fair review. Thanxs.
