comments on reviews

to mateox  geezum pulls the 1st marker, no sooner
than 2nd turn, but he pulls it, be careful not to
activate that site or the 4th marker when you want
to drop them.  you’re right on the x-wing cannon,
i didn’t play with the tala’s yet(don’t have them) and
assumed the cannon would work on them even though
they aren’t x-wings.  from my experience with this deck,
lateral damage won’t get played until later in the game.
plenty of time to be ready for it.  either way,
this deck is gonna fake out the opponent.  thanks
for the review

to mikeyp  With some luck, this deck can ’flip’ ebo
in as quick as 2 turns.  With less or no luck, it
will flip in 4 turns.  With bad luck, you flip hidden
base instead.	Against BHBM, start wise advice and
you at least won’t lose your destiny 5 interrupt.
And again, if ebo is having a tough time, go to hidden
base.  thanks

to corellian  Wedge from anh is what i refer to
as being cowboy wedge, from episode 4 when he
heads directly for the tie fighter chasing luke
and blows it up just before he flies right through
it’s direct path, YEEEEEHAAAAAAWWWWW

to cabdriver kessel is a new addition to the deck.
with hidden base, it will be the first system
to hit the table, if in reserve.  with squass, two
falcons and two cap’n hans, that can be a quick
drain spot if the opponent is weak in space.
As far as the 2/2 recommendation over my 1/1 sense
alter package, i believe firmly that 1/1 is enough
sense can cancel an alter, or sense an opponents
interrupt, it only needs to happen once to turn
a game in the right direction.	You should only need
one alter to cancel lat damage, and can cancel a sense.
I’m not worried that I don’t have enough sac.

Another benefit of this dual deck is that if one
isn’t working, the other might.  Also, the opponent
is likely to feel threatened by a deck that
uses what most would consider the two toughest light
side space themes.  There is nice ground support in
this deck and the mini falcon with bacta tank can
be tough.  Insurrection adding 2 to forfeit of blount,
cracken and wedge can soak alot of attrition and damage
in space.  There are so many ways that your opening hand
can give you a good edge on the match, and it is
this that makes this deck strong.

to p.ewok  X-wing cannons are a destiny 5 and can devestate a meager dark sides space package when they aren’t playing space.  But only 1 X-wing is something
I didn’t take enough time to consider, let me
know if you can think of a solution
thanks for the review

start with insurrection and strike planning for
sure, then decide between wise advice, squass
and battle plan, maybe even draw their fire,
but i can’t think why.  use battle plan if you
think you are going to get drained fast, squass
if you think you need to get to space quickly
and wise advice if you might play against
sac, or an interuppt heavy dark deck.


always be looking in your reserve deck to see if
vital cards are there for your picking, or if they
are in your active force.

1st turn, get crix from strike planning before
you activate, get docking bay with insurrection
from reserve and deploy it, if you don’t have
ansb in hand, signal for it, if no signal, check
to see if there are any in your active force
by counting how many signals in deck.
deploy a system with your obj.


you will end up deploying crix to that docking
bay and grabbing geezum with his text to use
geezum’s text to pull mpg and 4th marker.

once you have shields up, get ansb and either
get a system to flip hidden base faster,
or start setting up your ebo.

be sure to not activate important cards early,
i highly recommend activating less than possible
in the early game.

continue to use crix text to pull any of
the three scouts you have left.

use signals to get whatever remaining effects
you have.

set up your ebo and hidden base, and be ready
to do some smacking in space.

use your luke and obi’s with sticks to
clear out sites as possible.  use
bacta tank to save your rebels as you forfeit
them.

against hd and that other one, use blount.


well, somebody help me fill in the rest.

(on a side note, anyone else notice some
erratic behaviour in this section where
you post your strategy, it ’jumps’, seems
like a flaw in the code)

thanks for reading my deck, any ideas
are welcome, i’ve used at least one tip
from a reviewer each time i submit a version
of this deck, thanks
