Strategy: '

Here it is...my second version of Bring Him Before Me.  Speeder bikes were just too darned card intensive, and I wasn't winning any battles because nobody dare come battle me =(

Anyways, this deck speaks for itself.  Deploy, fight, win.  Just need to win 3 battles, and the game is over (4 with Jedi Luke).  With the force generation early on, I will be laying down some smack to win these battles....good luck Obi and Luke (BTW, I love Counterattack...opponent makes one mistake, and it's going to cost him the game with this card...the more battles, the better)

It's Worse?  OH YEAH	With the force activation of this deck, it only takes 1 It Could Be Worse.  Not to mention two 6 Destinies.

Battle Order...I will usually be generating more force than my opponent (well, basically always) and I'd rather them use their force to try and drain me, preventing them from deploying too much where I can't handle it)

If you know the characters, you'd know all of them are capable of kicking some major ass; by themselves, with their friends or on their vehicles/ships.  It does not matter by how much I win a battle by, only that I win the battle.  For BHBM, this is a must to understand.

Thanks for the reviews guys, helps a lot...cya
