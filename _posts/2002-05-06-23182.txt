rendilli 

Strategy: 

well 1st pull rendili befor you activate so you get it before thier one defensive shield gets placed. then put eperor down at opponents battle ground regardless of any thing (unless they don’t give you one, in which you then put at the endor DB). Drain until opponent tries to kill the emperor with a kamakaze luke or obi, and young fool thier ass, basically just do damage, place thier characters out of play with sidious or young fool and manipulate with the 3 januses. against combat put all stregth at the naboo DB, if you can barricade the Naboo DB, lightside will never beable to take it, meaning they won’t even beable to drain. Try it yourself, this went 4-0 at freedom con which speaks for itself.
Good luck and God Speed.
