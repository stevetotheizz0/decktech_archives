Strategy: 

--- Update 12.04.2001

Add ”Court Of The Vile Gangster/ I Shall enjoy Watching You Die” to the starting list. 

This was the missing card from my deck :(

--- End Of Update

Why This Objective And Not MKOS ??? (ofcourse MKOS has his good this too).
1st: you can pull docking Bays out of your deck.
2nd: You can pull starships out of your deck when you need them.
3th: Bounty Hunters get +2 forfeit & are immune to Goo Nee Tay.

Point Man: Cancel Scamble (does somebody plays with this card),Order To Engage & No Disintergrations.

Masterful Move: Cancel Bacta Tank. Bacta Tank is @#$ against this deck.

Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down: Cancel Mantellian Sarvip. 

ZiMH + Stinger + Guri + BiHT = HUGE.(3 destinies for you and nothing or 1 for him).
Got it last tournament in the air and it rocks. Even a Super Falcon is no match.

Ghhk & TRWEU: Cancel one react. This card is rocks. Did save me from a beatdown.

Jabba’s Sail Barge: Gives me protection from Fallen Portal.

Most of the strategy are well know against other decks so no need for them.

Possible Exchanges: 
 -Arica instead of MJ:TEH.
 -2nd Imperial Barrier instead of 2nd Twi’lek Advisor.
