Strategy: '

and now to convince you guys...

General first turn

get out Rendilli (before you activate) , Ds 2 db , Emperor (on db ) , Emperors power , Draw the rest

2nd turn  deploy vader on cc  db ( you should have 5 left) Draw a bit...

Now let the fun begin

* If they deploy Luke , you play Rise my friend
to db of Ds move with Emperor and duel ( they loose 3 force ; if you have T’wilek , play it to take i am your father...
Sense wathever duel thing tehy play...
You should be able to play a duel adder to have security about I am your father ..
When it’s your turn again , they will have lost  5 force.Also deploy something on your db.

* if not they loose 4 evrey turn + if they deploy , battle them. Use precautions against Hb and a wis player should have no prolem to stop their drains.the extra battle destiny is hady (very handy)

Track as much as you can...
If testing  Omni Box if they track their detiny’s
+ come here you big coward will kill thier retreval.

You keep on endor with your space if playing against an Eops deck.
Their drains are irrelevant agianst your dammage.
Make no silly battles.

It’s most important to track , i’m repeating it over and over , So you will not encounter any unespected things.

vs throne room  should be easy with your supreme denaiel

vs there’s still good in him  They will learn it’s not nice to think with their stomach.If vehicles are present , alter theitr flaps and they’ll soon have stop quit batteling.

Barriers will keep you save against difficult battles.You take the initiative then....

No escape is just in case...
If you think drop it than drop it.

Thank you for your time to read it and please enjoy.

Please give your constuctive ideas about this deck.
I’m open for new ideas.

Thanx
Just another player
