Objective:
       My Kind Of Scum/Fearless And Inventive 


Strategy: 

****START****

My Kind of Scum/Troopers Rule
Tatooine: Desert Heart
Jabba’s Palace: Audience Chamber
J’Quile (Rep)
Well Guarded
Prepared Defenses
An Entire Legion of my Troops
Mobilization Points
There is No Try/Oppressive Enforcement

****First Turn****

Take Carida into hand from reserve deck using Mob Points.

Deploy Mara Jade using the Audience Chamber game text.

Deploy as much Stormtroopers to the AC as you can

****Second Turn****

Beat some rebel scum

****Needs explaining****

Elis - Why Elis?  Well, Insurrection can prohibit movement, but I can still move to all of those docking bays using Elis.  That is how I can get out of the AC and around the Desert Heart gametext.

Trooper Assualt - Make them stormies more powerful

Dark Jedi Presense - Make them stormies even more powerful

J’Quille - Needed a rep.  Power 4.  Spy.  Excludes characters.  Cool rep.

Major Hewex - Adds to total power for each of the troopers present

Navy Trooper Fesden - Subtract from them edges retrieval cards

Sergeant Wallen - Deploys for free to my battle.  Use Trooper Assualt and DJP to boost him up.

An entire legion of my best troops - Troopers have armor = 4.  Blaster rifles deploy -1 and are destiny +2.

Imperial Academy Training - Increases forfeit, adds to weapon destiny (+2 now), and adds to battle destiny

Search and destroy - Start to hit with that direct damage

Crossfire - Adds to total power

Elite Squadron Stormtroopers - Ability = 2.  Destiny = 3.  Cheap to deploy blasters.  They rule

Blast Points - Used 5 that allows me to either add a destiny or deploy a weapon.

Dr. E and Panda - I hit characters, then the get ride of characters.

Twi’lek and Your Can’t hide forever - Gets out Imperial Academy Training fast.  Cancel’s numbers

Don’t panic agaisnt Throw me another charge.  Usually, the opponent doesn’t play with one or at the most 2.  Your fine.

****AGAINST DECKS****

Profit - AC is converted.  Deploy Mara and J’quille.  Get Troopers down ASAP.

Space - Tough.  Get out Search and destroy asap.  When confronted with Battle Plan, use the force, no worry.  It’s not like you have 10 stormtroopers who can’t deploy for free ;)

Watch Your Step - They won’t survive this.
