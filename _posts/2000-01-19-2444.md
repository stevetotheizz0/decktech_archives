Here is a first cut at the EJP light objective.

It includes lots of ways to stop weapons and several ways of freeing Han.

Ultimatum is in against Odds.
Battle Plan is for Operatives. If they use Operatives you will have to go fight. Use Harc and Order to Engage as well.

Basically, free Han first
stay alive by using the interupts, Disarmed and Talz, etc. to stop the opponent from targeting your mains while you focus on getting rid of his/her characters with weapons. Sorry about the Mess can help in a prolonged faceoff or it can get rid of spies.
Cause force loss with the objective, drain some,
Retrieve with the Celebration.	The rest is pretty self-explanatory.

Questions I have
Is Bacta Tank worth it if you know most people will be packing the counter?
Should I include a skiff or something to
a. React and/or
b. thwart Always thinking with your stomach?

Let me know what you think.
