Strategy: '

All right, history lesson.

Last year i built the Brangus Glee Superstar deck and it rocked.

Some people said that they liked hawkins deck better.

I didnt know that guy at that point but met him at worlds.

He played Brangus on CC though with some other objective.

Not my style but at least someone else who saw the power of brangus. But that guy has a different look on the game as other people as everybody who was at ramapo will know. So then Reflections 2 comes out and we build some WYS decks and they just kill my brangus. 

Big time. Too much cheap stuff and brangus was just not fast enough. So i put my brangus aside. I would still play it for fun but not in a tourney. Then tattoine comes out and iÂ´m thinking lots of decks and hayes hunter and me, we build an ISB space. We head to ramapo and its ok but not great. Hawkins played the dark deal stuff. But on sunday he showed me his brangus deck with podracing. Now he plays Set your course too. And i think cool, brangus might be back. Hawkins said its a deck that cant lose but read his TR from ramapo and you know that he likes to exaggerate things just a little bit.

So i get home and build my version. And it rocks again. So i talked to some people online and played a bunch of games with it on cardtable and give the deck to some people like Clint and Hayes who gave it to the Twiggs and so on and so on. 


If you still dont know how brangus works, look at my first brangus glee superstar deck.


Whats in?

Podracing obviously. Start will be podracing with wattos box as effect. To win the race, you have 3 podracer collions. I play 3 because you need to find them before the race is over, which could be turn 4. Once you have 1, you can reuse that with brangus. Normally you dont have to use put all sections before winning the race and retrieving your lost pile including your dbs. Dont delay winning the race so you can retrieve more. That only allows them to play it could be worse. And it gives them more control over the cards they lose.


The Masterful Moves. Its a desiny 6, that cant hurt. Savrip is back. It can fetch holonet transmission with cancels transmission terminated so it also cancels out of commision which is also very annoying. Holotable is a nice location. And you can deploy visage on the conference room It costs 2 force but you retrieve that when you win the race. Be very aware of honor though. Once you got no escape out its all good though. They lose 11 from the race. So you are ahead. And the 1 per turn is good for brangus too. You can lose of top and if you find something that fancies you, go get it. You dont have to put the visage down there though. Sometimes its also nice to slap the savrip on the holotable.


DAMAGE This deck has many ways to deliver damage besides draining. Thats the influence of Hawkins. You have sabacc, which also cancels there tracking or leaves them with no weapon desinies on their turn if they activate too much, counter assault, numbers and you can do some big battle damage.


Whats out?

The whole tie squadron combo. No starting Mob points anymore. So no sure wakelmui. People dont play dbs that much anymore. You can still retrieve with first strike though. Thats a killer.


The extra locations. All locations i play now can be pulled. Yes, i only play 1 battleground where i can drain, and thats only when the race is over. But with all the other damage sources you can still win comfortable.

3 weeks ago i played in the netherlands and i played against 3 decks that all played 1 battleground max. I got 3 full wins against 3 good dutch players.



Big props to John Hawkins for showing me that brangus is back.


Have fun


Bastian Winkelhaus
