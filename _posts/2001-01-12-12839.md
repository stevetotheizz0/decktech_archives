the hut starts on the other end of the sites, with the db in between, plus my bunker says only moved to from back door, so there is no way luke just waltzes in and is caught, he’ll have to do better than that.





Yes An endor ops. deck that can actually flip Start the game off with prepared defenses, imperial decree, arrest order and oppresive enforcement. however, if you are playing against rebel strike team, use twi’lek and pull perimeter patrol. first turn drop anyone to the bunker to make you opponent think twice before anything happens. Other than that, use walkers to control endor, along with darth and prison @#$% tarkin, igar, the Xizor, Guri and 4-LOM if needed. If you run inot a heavy ground deck on endor, use only admirals in space, and capt. gilad. use merrejk to pull systems, ominous rumors and admiral Chiraneau to drain at them, establish so grand admiral on his Chimaera can drain at endor, and the admiral’s orders to just make the star destoryers kick all sorts of a$$.


Some good combos to look for


Chimaera with Thrawn and Capt. Gilad piloting power 14, armor 8, hyper speed 5, immune to attrition less than 8 with the orders out, two destinies HOLY SH*T


Virago w/ Xizor piloting deploys for a total of 4, power 6, adds a destiny, immune to attrition less than 5


Stinger w/ Guri piloting Deploys for total of 2 power 5, adds a destiny, immune to attrition less than 5


Chiraneau on a star destroyer at sullust Adds 1 to drians at all your systems, becasue they are within two parsecs, for a total drain plus three at each system, and plus 4 at endor with establish out and working.


Forest clearing and any walker power plus 1, force drain plus 1, this site rocks


Dark Forest and imperial force drain plus 1


Imperial Outpost all your at-st’s are immune to attrition less than 3, plus no more than one destiny for opponent, anywhere


this is a good deck against the many destinied deck of WYS.  '
