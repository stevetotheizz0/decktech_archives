The idea behind this deck is to not give you're opponet any force.  You pull off ralliter 0ps very fast like 3-4 turns and put a sleen at every site so they can't deplay there.  after that with all the sites in the deck you should have planty of froce and you go to you're opponet where ever they are and the attack them with the ability to add 3 to total battle destinies and get one card from you're deck every turn.

The deck has 2 plans.  If they are playing a space deck then you want to blow up yavin 4 and make all their ships deploy +8.  The idea is that they won’t have obi in the space deck.  If they are playing a ground deck then you want to destroy the planet that they are doing their thing on.	Most decks are now giving the related system due to objectives dagobah or celebration decks if no I am playing with the systems a ground deck will typically be at.
