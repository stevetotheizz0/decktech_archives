Strategy: '

This version of Drazin is set to survive without having a captive.  Against Hidden Base, you get to verify so just take note of the double systems and go probe there first.  The sabaccs are also good for stealing xwings and getting rid of battleground systems.  Against ops, just start battle order and go beat down with characters and recurring vaders -).	I believe that this is currently the strongest Drazin there is now.  One enemy is Noble Sacrifice, but that is why there are more then one ways to capture an additional character in this deck.'
