Combat Response
This is so I can get sinear fleet systems going. Combat response is for the sabers.



Locations

These four are for good activation, cant always rely on the opponent or your systems.


Yavin 4
Tatooine
Hoth
They give me two Icons and yavin and hoth can be used with imperial decree.

Kuat (the react text is cool and this card is cool with wakeelumai)

Kiffex
Kashyyyk
Sullust
These are all drain 2, if I can get chrianeau out then they will be even better.

My ground guys, Can hold a site on their own and each one has at least one weapon in this deck.

Admiral Chiraneau
DS-181-2
DS-181-3
Major Turr Phennir
Baron Soontir Fel
My imperial pilots. All are cool.


Starships
Tie Intercepter x10
Power 5 with all power to weapons.

Avenger
Devastator
Chimaera
Accuser
Visage
The above are my ties backup

Zuckuss In Mist Hunter
Dengar In Punishing One
These two stop attrition and cause yours to hurt them more. Great together.

Saber 1
Saber 2
Saber 3
Saber 4
Saber squadron rules.

Weapons
Vader's Lightsaber x2
Mara Jade's Lightsaber
For my ground guys.


Effects
Imperial Decree
Stop big drains.
Dreaded Imperial Starfleet
Cancel a few drains.
Reactor Terminal
Sienear Fleet Systems x2
ok, you set these up on wakeelumai early to get some force retrieval most of the game.


Interrupts
Short Range Fighters
Retrieve 10 with sienear then 10 more with this.
All Power To Weapons x4
Those ties are pwoer 5 each!

Twi'Lek Advisor
Get out decree or somethin else.

Point Man
Cancels some gay cards.


ok, you start wakeelumai and get out SFS. Then you deploy ties and retrieve and drain. If they come to fight, play all power to weapons to have power 5 ties. Eventually you should overpower them and retrieve enough to win the game.
