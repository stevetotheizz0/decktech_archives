Strategy: 

one simple note before i get into this deck-Jedi pak han is used because he does not suspend uhoh!seeing hes an alien for whatever reason.

	 Basically this deck sets up boshuda with uhoh out first turn(unless they overlaped your sights first turn)then gets the three alien combo out pretty fast(rennek kabe,and tessek)Get them out in that order.Rennek must come out first or else bubo will screw your day over. Then get the key of the deck out KABE, he will take your opponents dignity and through it out the window when they leave vader at a lone sight thinking he can hold his own heh heh heh.
After you have every thing set up fight where opponent is and drain for alot on cloud city if the refuse to fight on ground.(also be awhere that you can free han whenever you want not immeidiatly when you control the location.)
	If your opponent tries to stop your retrieval with some one under boshuda drop down order to engage so it makes em lose force each turn they dont battle you (which they wont)
	  That has been the best stratogy I have found to use against most oppopnents. This deck has been very good to me over the year and I hope it only gets better.
