Strategy: '

I start this deck with Coruscant and Twi&#8217;lek Advisor and I usually pull out Imperial Arrest Order.  I can then pull out Coruscant DB and the other two Docking Bays so I can reach my opponent wherever they are.  It also makes most of my ISB agents forfeit +2.
I try to get a hold of the 2-2 sites as soon as possible with either my walkers or Vader/Tarkin.  I then hold the site for the rest of the game if possible.  I can choose either to go to Tatooine or Endor, depending upon my opponents moves.
Resistance keeps numbers decks at bay, while security precautions can be pulled at the start to kill Hidden Base.  I use the starships to quickly take complete control of space and enjoy the drains.
As many of you suggested I have removed the scanning crews and added Secret Plans.  I also added Imperial Barriers to keep an EPP beat down from catching me off-guard.  The new cards in this deck are marked by a *.
Nevar Yalnal helps when my opponent tries to go undercover at my sites.  The added walker and igar give me even more strength to destroy my opponent on the ground.  Search and destroy will hurt the new EBO decks until they can get set up.
