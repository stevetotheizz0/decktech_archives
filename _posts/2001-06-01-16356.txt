UPDATE  WITH THE ”TUNNEL VISION EFFECT IT MAKES UP FOR THE SLOW 3 TURNS PLUS YOU DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE MEDIUM BULK FREIGHTERS, WELL THEN WHY IS IT UNDEFEATED?




AWESOME DECK WHICH LETS YOU PULL EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DEPLOY THAT TURN

FIRST AT THE END OF THERE TURN PULL SOLO AND CALRISSIAN IF YOU DONT HAVE THEM IN YOUR HAND IF YOU DO PULL OTHER GENERALS. SACK YISYW IF YOU DONT HAVE LAUCHING ASSAULT IN HAND SO YOU CAN DEPLOY IT YOUR TURN. DEPLOY LAUCHING THE ASSAULT, PAY 1 TO SEARCH FOR SITE, SEE IF HOME ONE IS IN, IF SO PULL IT INTO HAND, HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE EITHER 1 ACKBAR OR BA TO GO GET HIM.  SAVE FORCE TO DEPLOY HOME ONE W ACKBAR NEXT TURN.  THEN WAIT TILL YOU HAVE FORCE TO DEPLOY TWO CHARACTERS TO FLIP QMC USING KTEOF, THEN DEPLOY CC CELEBRATION USE YOUR ADMIRALS ORDER TO MAKE THEM LOSE FORCE, AND DURING YOUR AND THEIR TURNS GO THROUGH YOUR FORCE PILE TO GET WHAT YOU NEED TO WIN, UNBEATABLE IN MY MIND IF PLAYED RIGHT.  THINK ABOUT IT ITS NOT HARD TO PLAY,   '
