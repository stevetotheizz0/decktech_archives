Strategy: '

Ok, first turn you get out the <>docking bay and deploy it to tatooine. (I use this instead of Mos Espa or 94 because opponent’s pilots deploy + 1 there. After freeing han, this deck focuses on two sites. The <> docking bay, and Tatooine JP. After getting a moisture farmer out, I get out my vaporators and stations, and with ardon crell out my force drains are + 2 at both. I stick Vapor Crell, and any farmers left over in the AC with Bo Shuda protecting them. I put all my mains and their backup guarding these two sites draining for 6, and making them lose 2 per turn. This deck has an average destiny of exactly 3.0 I have five 7’s. Anyway the rest is pretty easy. Strangle is a 7, and in case they are playing court and capture one of my mains. I know that I am using the three crappiest versions of leia, but I really dont have anything else. Thats it. Oh heres the destiny layout.

0’s = 1     = 0
1’s = 18    = 18
2’s = 4     = 8
3’s = 8     = 24
4’s = 11    = 44
5’s = 3     = 15
6’s = 2     = 12
7’s = 5     = 35


Add them together to get 156. Divide 156 by 52 and u get 3. There you have it. '
