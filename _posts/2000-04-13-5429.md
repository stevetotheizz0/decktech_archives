MWYHL/SYIC  '

Strategy: '

This is a revision of my MWYHL deck.

Always start with Wise Advice for SAC protection, the ability to stack their interrupts for free, and to add 1 to training draws. Set the site like this Training Area (Test 1), Bog Clearing (Test 2), Jungle (Test 3), Swamp (Test 4), Yoda's Hut (Test 5). This way you can finsih up testing with your dudes at Yoda's Hut to subtract from attrition. I'm testing with Luke Skywalker for the +1 activation. I find Boussh to be more effective than DOS. Her with TK-422 and Projection of a Skywalkers will shut down all drains. With Test 1 completed, put a PoaS at a +1 drain site like Moisture Farm to shut it down and use Boussh or TK-422 at places like Backdoor and Downtown Plaza. Anyway, don't deploy your guys until the end unless its a really good opportunity. Carbonite Chamber is for a drain 2 battleground and the ships are there to have some space presence. The characters all draw destinies by themselves and with test 5 completed with a 7 on it, they're immune to attrition of atleast 3 with (Yoda at Hut and test 3) and they have +7 power with the destiny. Didn't include duel protection because all my destinies are 7's and they may scare em a bit. You shouldn't be deploying guys very early, so use Anger, Fear, Aggression, and Uncontrollable Fury to deal force loss and use Suprise Assaults along with your 7's to deal some additional force loss here and there. Battle Plan should handle the drains along with Boussh, TK-4222, Test 1, and the two Projections. Traffic Control can recycle your high destinies and then you track them and use them with Suprise Assault, testing, and/or On the Edge. Push's will deploy for free and they can keep those annoying interrupts from recycling and from being used for free. Effective Repairs is too retrieve AFA's or somehing of the sort. Transmission Terminated is for Visage and On the Edge (with test 5) along with the objective will provide good retrieval. Watch out for Secret Plans and Come Here You Big Coward though.  '
