Strategy: '

  As you can probably tell I use Droids to do a lot for me.  Start Wise Advice all the Time.  Use HDWGITTM to get what you need when you need it.	It you are good at counting then you should always have the Destiny you need to win most Battles.  And if there is a Droid involved then you can Cancel your Opponents Destiny using DFTD.  Which of course is good against Numbers.

  I have played this deck at two different Tournaments, before ECC, and after, and it went undefeated both times.  Most of the Time I don't use We're Doomed, because my life force doesn't get that low.  But against certain good Hunt Down Decks I need it.  Also if Dark is playing a Strong Space Deck then We're Doomed will win the Game for you.  You should be able to Cancel Visage with TT or your spies.  When you play this deck you will see how well, and easy it is to play.  That is it let me know what you think.  Oh and as you probably can tell I do not write well.
