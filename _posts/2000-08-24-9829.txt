Strategy: 

Start Imperial Square, Prepared Defences, IAO,
Mob.Points and Imp Decree.  First turn, screw for
a spy,	Deploy a 1/0 DB from reserve, and try to
get an imp scrub there for more activation.  The
manip is pretty self-explanitory, and just drop ISB
agents and drain.  No 5D6 because I couldn't find
my copy, and I don't have any ORS.  Try to hold
Rendili and Coruscant for Imp.Decree, or the two
Rebel Base DB's.
