----END UPDATE------


START
Hidden Base
RP
Endor
HFMF
Insurrection
Staging Areas
Strike Planning

First turn, pull out Dagobah, followed by the hut, then home one docking bay. If tou have a guy you can put him at the docking bay for activation with staging areas.
Next turn, pull endor and the hoth docking bay. Then on subsequent turns pull out the rest of the docking bays and react to what the opponent does.
Use throw me another charge and fall of a legend to track destiny sixes for on the edge/off the edge retrieval. This deck is good because once your mains have died they keep on coming back because of retrieval.

Heres how this deck goes against other decks.

BHBM
Give him jedi luke. This is a battle of docking bays. Ben kenobi, lando and fallen portal will win the game. Dont waste your SAC because he will probably have a hefty SAC package.

Hunt Down
Use spies to cancel visage. Watch out for the duel. set up destinies if possible. throw all your senses at duelling cards. again docking bays is where all the action will take place. Ben Kenobi, lando and fallen portal will be huge.

Scum
Take the chamber is the way. Alter their scum. Ben kenobi will be huge. He will keep your guys alive. sense their barriers and none shall pass.
after you clear them, retrieve.

TIES
Just watch out for the beatdown. Use your SAC to get rid of things like APTW and dreaded fleet. Use space fleet wisely.

Please give me some feedback.	'
