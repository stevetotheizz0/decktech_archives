Strategy: '

It's back. Simple stuff. Get a lot more activation , put out locations , drain and battle.

Start  Always start Imperial Arrest Order unless they start Local Uprising and a non-battleground system in which case you'd start Battle Order.

You go and get 3 of the floating 7 locations in the deck so any locations you draw will be 2/2s that you will drain and battle at. This is build for right now before DS2 Releases. When DS2 Releases that cool new Vader will be put in here twice so that stupid Uncontrollable Fury doesn't nail me , that's one of the few problems with this deck. Also when DS2 Comes out the Effects and scrubs will change so this will be a strong deck when that comes out.

Got Landing Claw and decent Undercover Protection.
Savrip is the only thing this deck HAS to cancel , this deck can work around Bacta Tank.
