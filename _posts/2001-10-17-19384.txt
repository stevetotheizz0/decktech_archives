Strategy: 

This is a revamp of the Three Character Limit deck with some vital changes.  Here goes:

Strategems and Hints

Use Reactor Terminal and Electrobinoculars to track Artoo in Red Five for Jedi Test 5 completion.

Use Surprise Assault to eliminate force-drains from opponent or eliminate their force reserves.

First turn pull Training Area with Degobah game text, then keep pulling Jedi tests.

Use Artoo and A Gift to slow down excess force drains (if necessary).

Use Strangles to track 7’s for before flipping JT 5 and to protect against capturing Luke.

Use Artoo as numbers protection.

Drop fast beatdown with Luke, Obi Wan, and Qui Gon, using Gift of the Mentor to add destinies with Luke and Obi or pull Qui’s lightsaber.

Restore forfeited beatdown with Jedi Resilience.

If a battle goes poorly, use Houjix to get out of uncomfortable situations.

If opponent playing a capturing deck, use strangle to free your power 6 characters.

Keep Yoda at Yoda’s Hutt after training to keep down attrition.

Any questions?
