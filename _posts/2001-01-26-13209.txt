Strategy: 

This deck just has a basic 5 step strategy.

1) Get all sites out.
2) Control them with troops.
3) Try to flip by 3-6 turn.
4) Once fliped control sites and drain.
5) Go battle the LS and add at the most 7 to each battle destiny.

If playing air deck.

1) Do steps 1-4.
2) once that is completed pull star destroyers each turn for 2 force.Save rest of force.
3) Wait until they have seperated and deploy all starships.
4) If they dont seperate deploy starships when you have atleast 5 in hand. Make sure you have enough ability.Make sure to add the destiny from the sites you control.
5) Keep on doing that and moving until you kill the opponet.
