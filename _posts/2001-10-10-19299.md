Cards: 

'Im leaving the SWCCG world, and am selling my colection off as a whole, with 5 palpys and 2 LSJK&#8217;s... Email me at HHHisthegame7777@aol.com. 

Article I can seriously say now that the SWCCG game is not fun to me anymore. After seeing Jar Jar in Tatooine i was angry at why he was so good, and now with Reflections 3 here I am disgusted with Deciphers cards here. I&#8217;ve been playing this game since shortly after the release of Premiere, nearly 6 years. My collection of cards and decks are now up for sale, email me at HHHisthegame7777@aol.com with all of your reasonable offers, around $500 asking price. Here is what I have
