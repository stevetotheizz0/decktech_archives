Strategy: '

		Alright, this deck has gone 10-3 in tournament play, and in my opinion is about 100 x better than my old one. 
		I start with IAO, Plans , and Mobilization Points. IAO to pull the DB’s , Plans  for On The Edge protection, and Mob Points for extra generation. Getting Vader and a saber out early shouldn’t be too hard, so get Vader and Mara a-draining early to keep them on their toes. Pretty much just drain and flip, and kick some @$$.. Dueling is a main part of this deck. I have put several decks “ Out Of Commission” with dueling, and the destiny for dueling cards just rules. . Force Field is for those damn EPP sabers we all hate so much. Remember – Flip , Drain , Trample , Repeat. 

	Card Explanations and Combos

Secret Plans- This cards never coming out. Once stopped a MWYHL retrieval with On the Edge of 16. Good, good, good.

Dengar + Dr. E and Baba = Two shots, operation. 

Vader + Tarkin = Come on. 

Lord Vader = Didn’t need it, but fury is a btch. 

Visage + Circle =  Good destiny. Also, duel Obi for some serious damage. 

	Other that this deck runs pretty well, and I hope it does well in states this year.

		Vs. Strategies-
Vs. Hidden Base
Watch out for Boussh , Blount, etc…canceling that Visage and draining on the Executor. Air may hurt, but don’t worry, just drain and probe. 

Vs. MWYHL 
Tough game. Jedi Tests will fu*k you over early, and remember, always assume their destiny for JT5 is a 7.  

Vs. Profit
Secret Plans may help if they try to pull an early flip. Don’t give’em aliens to start unless you really want to give em a smackdown you think you can win. 


Good Luck
