Strategy: '

Ok you start most of the time with Oppresive Enforcement so you can grap for free and sense/alter defense.  There's a couple of tech cards in here so let me explain.

1) Ephant Mon goes to the Bunker and is same from spies.

2) Imperial Justice is in here because the only location I care about getting revolutioned is the bunker.  You can put justice on it w/ Arrest order nothing will get in.

3) Those Rebels won't escape canels claw as well as Nabrun (if Arrest order isn't out) as well as reacts.

To play this deck you get Ephant Mon at Bunker, Walker at the Platform and drain in space.  Simple and effective.  Not much chance of getting beat down.

Againsts Ops-set up big drains and get Battle Order set up

Against Profit- rough but set up Decree with drains.  Win... but not big.

Against Mind- start Broken Concentration and Drain early.  Then hit them with Failure at the Cave.

Against Y4 Start- start Oppressive and draw to you get everything you want, they won't be able to set up and big drains unless they give you force.  This deck isn't hurt by Grimtash and if done used grab it.  Oola... shock the b*tch.

Hidden Base- beat the crap out of them.  I shouldn't have to explan.  all the force they give you plus yours,	easy win.

That's it. '
