Strategy: '

Editors note #1 this is how I played it at a tournament with no Tatooine. so dont talk to me about walkers.  Dont say tatooine to me.


Editor’s Note #2 I did NOT steal the name.  During my last game, someone playing a game at an adjacent table said, ”Hidden Base?  All Your Base Are Belong To Us?”, and I said,” no, All My base are belong to Me”.

Okay, this is a basic X-wing swarm with a lot of built in tech.  

When I was building this, I looked at some of the problems that go with swarms S & D can wreck them usually.  High drains hurt unless you play The Planet That Is Farthest from and Tatooine.  I decided no Spies because they are easily dealt with.  But I thought, Kirdo III pulls Desert and Sandwhirl, so Ill play a Reb. Snowspeer and C/TV and I can in one move, stop S & D and use Menace Fades by third or fourth turn.  I pack the three biggest drains in Coruscant, Kessel, Kiffex so I can out-drain them fairly easily.  The Home One is a powerhouse.  The Cannons can stop TIES while HBTTS lets them hit one a battle.  You have retrievel in AWRI and DTF.  This deck won by margins of 10, 29, and 30.  You can shut down even Scums drains with the fading Menace while you batter them.  OOC/TT can stop Visage and you can find it with C/TV.  I dont play Rebel fleet because I need my X-wings down fast.  First turn pull X-wings with an Organized if you have one.  Pull Endor, drop X-wings to the RP, and move to Endor.  Second turn repeat and move the Endor stuff to Hoth. third turn and subsequent spread and drain.  You play the same way against basically everything so there is no matchup section.  Check out Chus x-wing swarm for basic play.  Thanks for reading.   '
