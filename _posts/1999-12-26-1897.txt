Strategy: '

Start Tosche and Obi's Hut. Deploy Obi to Hut as early as possible and move his to Tosche. Then activate alot and beatdown. I decided to change this deck alot from the old one by getting rid of Junkin and grenades and the speeders. It's now mains and toys with SAC, space, and the basic stuff. I added Eject Eject as an easier way to deal with Fett in Slave I and Dengar in Punishing One. Mechanized Failure is for Big Blue walkers and since AT-AT's landspeed is 1, it should be effectie for a few turns. I hope this deck turns out better than the last one.

Take out one Clash of Sabers for Glancing Blow, take out one Mechanized Failure for Anakin's Saber, and take out one sense for Obi-wan's saber. '
