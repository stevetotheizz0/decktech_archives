Cards: 

'Objective--->(1)'

Strategy: '

Shit, take out x1 Twi'Lek Advisor for x1 Force Lightning.  AND IF YOU NOTICED, I'M 1 CARD SHORT IN THE DECK, THAT 1 CARD SHOULD BE EPIC DUEL.  And take out Unexpected Interruption for x1 Search & Destroy.

I made this deck to look more like a BHBM style, but I like Hunt Down cuz of dueling and @#$% like that.  Honor is not hard to fight your way around.  I know the character base is thin, but it works.  If you can track your destiny, track some 5s and 6s and you should win all duels.

Pull Rendili before you activate first turn.  Get out your docking bays each turn.  Battlegrounds should not be a problem.  If your opponent gets anxious cuz he sees your objective and deploys Honor with no guys out, alter it, with Palpy out, only the other Visage can stop you, but the chances are in your favor.  The ships are good for destiny, the new executor is a 5, and the dreadnaughts are all 4s.

The deck has gone 12-0 for me right now.  It tears up everything.

Search and Destroy will eat HB alive, or any space oriented deck for that matter.  And 2 battlegrounds will not be hard to occupy since most likely you'll see Honor of the Jedi every game, so you should be at 3 (if your lucky, maybe you'l get to alter it).  Only duel when you've stacked [tracked].  Random dueling could turn out very bad for you.	The Docking Bays will pretty much get you to anywhere, but Yavin [and obviously Dagobah].  The goal of this deck is too occupy 3 battlegrounds to satisfy Honor and since you will be ridding of Luke and Ben, they cannot flip you back.  Ever had a DS Jedi Luke on your side? it's sweet...lemme tell ya.

Cards I would like to add'
