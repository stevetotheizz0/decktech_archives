==================================
UPDATE - 10/ 17/ 00
Vouyer is now being replaced by Myn Kyneugh.
This guy rocks. I will state part of his text ”Your troopers and royal gaurds may ’react’ to here for free.”
WOW They try a beat down on him and you can reverse it Only bad part is that he only deploys to Coruscant orPaply site. But, with Quarren (he can be pulled using the back of RalOps) he can deploy there. If you get paranoid, you can replace Spaceport Street with Coruscant Docking Bay.

BTY, for everyone reviewing this I know about Ounee Ta. This deck was made to stop it, or at least be prepared to deal with it. If they try a beatdown, note the many cards that can react and allow for reacts (look above). So please no more, ”This deck stinks. Ounee Ta would kill it” And to say a little more, not that many people will be playing it. Sure it’s good against a RalOps deck, but won’t do jack against a HD or BHBM or even Court Deck.
====================================

Basically, this thing kicks. I love this deck. I have taken it to 2 tournys and I got a first and a second place. Its strong against most types and should win by a large margin. Here goes the Strat.

Start by getting out Ralltiir, Pred Defenses, IAO and First Strike. The thrid effect will depend. Your first turn, start by getting out Spaceport Docking bay, any other sites (not Carida) you got and the one site you get from the objective. Deploy any scrubs you got. Put up left over force. End turn one. Turn two Get out another site. And any other characters you got. You should be able to flip now. Search your reserve deck and get Carida, if you don’t already have it and deploy it.

With First strike out you can really hurt the oppoent. It rocks Using Projective Tele, you can stop lots of battles, unless the oppoent uses 2 force. But here is the tech Say you got a lonely Stromtrooper cadet at a site where the oppoent has a EPP Luke and lots of other guys. You initate a battle. You retrieve one he loses one, then play Projective, on yourself and don’t pay the extra force the battle ends, and you can move away your guy. Great if you need that card on top of your lost pile.

The Tempest Scouts can move as reacts (T6 can deploy for 1 as a react) to help stop beat downs. Also, if you have IM4 at a site with a trooper, Rebels deploy +2 to that site, +4 if at Ralltiir. Also, if IM4 at a site where oppoent drains, you can deploy 4 troopers as a react. Little beatdown thing IM4 at a site with oppoent’s character(s). He drains, deploy 4 troopers, and T6. Play Full Scale Alert, oppoent can’t move and you got a battle next turn.

2X helps too All Imps and Aliens at same site under Nighttime conditions (Sunsdown) are power +2 and immune to attrition <3. Helps the troopers with low power and no immunity. This little guys could help that beatdown thingy above if the site under Sunsdown (or nightfall if oppoent has it out.)

Basic Macth-Ups

Profit Dont start any aliens. Other effect should be Mob. Points. You can put Carida out turn one since Profit usally doesn’t have space in it. Let them get out Han and them let them spread thin for the lost of force bouns. Get out IM4 to help stop the draining and go for massive beatdowns.

MWYHL This deck was made to play against it. Play as normal. Load up the Sapce Cruiser and move to dagobah. Land and go to Luke (or DOS). Since oppoent will usally run away, Use Full Scale Alert to stop his movement. Kill Luke and if you can Yoda. This will delay them. Keep Luke off the table and the game should be set, drain at dagobah sites and ralltiir.

HB/ Space Start YCHF. Pull S&D ASAP. Set it up and drain away. Filp and there drains should slow down. Use the starships to control Ralltiir. Don’t Pull Carida They will move to Ralltiir so quickly. Drain on the ground and the game should be over.

EBO Star Imperial Decree. Star up RalOps and pull the two hoth sites. Deploy put down guys and control them. There drains should die and yours kick. Battle them away and games over.

That’s all. If you’re wondering where I got the name (youre not but cause it worked for Monkey Ties) Most of the troopers are Endor or Hoth.Dumb I know but whatcha going to do. If you have a better name, tell me....
