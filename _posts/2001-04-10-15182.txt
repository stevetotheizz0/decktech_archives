Against   TIGIH

This is a god matchup and will push the deck. the 2 i have played i have beaten by 12 & 9 so it does come close. on the first turn put an imperial down at the docking bay and reduce their activation to 4. then put down Vader go in for the capture. get him to the docking bay or to a drain site and stack up defensively. pull out the EXECUTER with mob. points and put it at endor. be sure to control endor, put the CHIMAERA there as well and you should be right. choose your battles carefully and dont allow them to get anything stacked on their pile (FROM BATTLES). beat up on them, but dont allow it to happen to yourself. you should be able to win against this.

Against   Others

Get the EXECUTER to endor along with its good friend Mr. CHIMAERA (and crew) and then get your men on the ground to drain for lots while in space you beat thm off with a stick.
always be sure to check exactly what characters they put down, if they get a Leai Han combo or a Han Chewie combo play scruffy... or Furry Furry and subtract a good amount from their power/attrition. '
