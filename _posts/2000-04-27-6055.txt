Strategy: 

This is the AT-ST Rallops deck I brought to states.  This time, however, it DOES have the Point Man!

The general strategy is to obtain a fairly quick flip, then search for the cards needed to counter the opponent's strategy, whether it be by battling or draining.  You can counter ANYTHING with this deck.

You have some nice battling combos: Vader + Tarkin and either the Saber or I Have You Now, Tempest I + Igar, Tempest Scout 2 + Watts + Marquand, 4-LOM + Iggy.	Use them to gain the advantage.

Operatives -- Start Battle Order.  Flip quickly but watch for speeder beats.  Then pull Empire's New Order and some battling combos and go right at them!  Especially try to get DVDLOTS plus Tarkin, because that's the best way to keep your guys safe while killing the Ops.  Deploy your ships to their system and if they get out a Landing Claw, move to Ralltir.  They either have to follow and lose the battleground for BO or be susceptible to a beatdown.  Since this strategy isn't flawless, you still need to make sure not to deploy your 2 capitals just in case.  You shouldn't have a problem.

Mind What You Have Learned -- Start Bad Feeling Have I and get the draining going.  MWYHL won't be able to move as fast and you'll be able to get your stuff going before they even have a chance.

Profit -- Start Imperial Arrest Order.	Point Man cancels the Order to Engage.	Kill Han if you can.  You ought to have a fun game!

Hidden Base -- Start Bad Feeling Have I unless you are ABSOLUTELY SURE that you won't be facing mains.  Take out OTE with Point Man, battle where you can, take out there space fleet.  No big challenge.  You'd do the same thing against an OMDH No Flip deck.

Update -- Whoops forgot to say what you do against Throne Room -- Start Crush.  Pull your Evader first turn but wait to use it until they've revoed some of your stuff.  Only deploy the sites from reserve and the other battleground locations if you get them.  Also pull the I Have You Now for some added defense.  The next version will probably have some Barriers to help out, thanks to the reviewer who noticed that.

For Numbers you have Resistance, pull it quick. Update -- In response to Paul's (right?) review, Vesden is no better than Resistance.  Why?  You still have to GET him, which means a flip.  At least with Resistance I have a Twi'lek for back up!  That is enough Numbers protection.

Not much else you need to anticipate, 'cept the Rogue decks.  Even then, just counter whatever they use, developing a strategy to take the victory.  Thanks for your reviews in advance.  Version 2.0 will probably have some barriers and perhaps a couple of Alters.  Who knows what'll happen!
