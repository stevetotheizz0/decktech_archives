Strategy: 

Just a not e for thoses who are miss informed retwin in ig2000 blocks hb  drains and hides from battls and i dont own a ig with gun so in aint in here as i said this works well in my area a lil mod and it should kick ass in yours.i have no hb decks round my area right now so i have no need fro sec pro


This deck is very fun to play and works good

The basic set up is start imperial arrest order and then get out your docking bays if they refused to put down luke or obi then u hurt em

Ok well there is a i just as soon a kiss a wookie to get rid of 1 of then pesky mains for a turn.

Basically put your scouts out and about and vader and tarkin if front of han .
he will battle you so u then play you are beaten to shrink the force in front of u
then u play u have overestimated there chances. then to top it off react with your tempest scouts to make a big power force.

when they loose cause of there @#$%yness cos they had 10 power more and they just lost the battle by 15 and then 3 times that 45 dammage from 1 battle hurts.

well thats just 1 way to hurt the oponent
dualing is pritty easy to hit em with the large drawn in the deck and a spare visage in case of them tt's .

the scouts are great cos they can react using the docking bays so they are and extra bounus with the deck .

well i hope u give this deck a go and see how it works .

thanks
