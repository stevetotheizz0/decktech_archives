Strategy: '

This is the deck used by Ohmy Fasudhani to win the Mt. View Grand Slam. Ive modified it slightly, but not by much. The deck basically needs to free Han, and pick your battles wisely(since there are only 13 characters in the deck, each is crucial).

Sense and Alter really hurt this deck, so you may want to include something to back up Do or Do Not.Start w/ Battle Plan vs. Ops and ISB, and Goo Nee Tay vs. just about everything else.
