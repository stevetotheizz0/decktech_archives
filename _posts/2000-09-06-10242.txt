Strategy: 

There are only 59 cards listed above (oops); the 60th card is Bad Feeling Have I.

Starting stuff:
Bring Him Before Me/Take Your Father's Place, Death Star II: Throne Room, Your Destiny, Insignificant Rebellion, Prepared Defenses for Imperial Arrest Order, Mobilization Points, and Oppressive Enforcement

Object of deck:
First turn, you pull the D*2:DB, Emperor (deployed to DB), Emperor's Power, and Wakeelmui.  Second turn, you're activating at least 8 Force and are ready to roll.
This deck is a basic TIE deck w/ a BHBM twist.	Flipping the objective is non-essential, but can be done.
The setup is to get out all your systems (draw for them), then park Palpy and Sim at the Throne Room.  This makes you able to both add a battle destiny w/ Emperor's Power and manipulate your opponent's destiny draw with Sim.  With this, you could also park the Presence Of The Force and a Vader there to get around Battle Plan and to make your opponent lose to Your Destiny.
The virtue of the deck is in not taking much Force drain damage.  Dreaded Imp Starfleet will save 1 drain w/ an Interceptor, Tarkin's Orders will cancel drains related to systems you control and can cancel any little surprises, and ATWYS will make your opponent miss his characters.
After getting at least 2 Interceptors per system, you'll be all set.  Your opponent will expire shortly after absorbing your big drains plus Your Destiny damage.  This deck has a winning differential of between 20-40.
Fighter Cover is in simply to get around opponent's Admiral's Order, plus can give your cannon-equipped TIEs a boost in power and ability to kill off opponent's starfighters.
Chimaera is the only capital ship in because it has an immunity to attrition < 4, isn't as expensive as Executor, and can carry my TIEs around to different locations if need be.
Retrieval engine for this deck is Sienar Fleet Systems and Short-range Fighters.

Against a space deck, you are assured to win a large percentage of battles thanks to All Power To Weapons, Emperor's Power and Lateral Damage.
Against a ground deck, all you need to contend with are the drains, which you can easily cancel.  Your drains should eat away at your opponent faster then their drains that get through the canceling.  You shouldn't have to go to ground, but if you see a hole in their defense, Iggy, Mara, and Vader (if not already on table) can make short work of them and make them stack one on Insignificant Rebellion.
