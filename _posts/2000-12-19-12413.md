Strategy: '

well everyone posts their version, this is mine.

start usually i start the throne room. in general i use heading for the frigate to get out some effects. most of the time i play staging areas, insurrection and insight. if you suspect sac change insight to wise advice. or whyat the hell just play smart and start whatever is the best to counter the opponent.

get out sites, put scrubs at db’s for force, fight or drain on ground or air, and win.

ok why dont i use-
gooneetay-its not needed...dark deck activate enoughh force to get by it...and they use mob points with 2/2 scrubs, not vader or jabba...

trans terminated-well you got honor... and spies...and choke its cool

chewie-didnt have room

now, why do i use?-
choke-it rules. good vs any deck with alien... hmm thats cout,mkos,sycfa/scum,some hdadtj,some bhbm, and more...

honor-well not alot of people use no escape yet

i hope she allright-well i only have 1 bg site, but look at it this way you only use it vs space decks, and the only space decks are endor op and sycfa, and both of them give you the 2nd bg site you need.

master luke, old school obi- well they are better vs mkos (get rid of the rep) and other decks. i still play ben and jedi luke tho, they are ok at
the duel vs hd.

balanced attack- grab ackbar, or obiwan.

the ao- it hurts tie decks and can be pulled by ackbar.

matchups
ties-get the home 1 (by launching the assult, which can be gotten by insight). set up i hope shes allright. drain on ground with sabers. fight in space with loaded moncals. go to wakelmui to make ties expensive. sense aptw, or grab it. alter sfs if you can.

scum-play smart. use your quirky cards like choke and master luke to give you the advantage. alter scum if you can. sense goofy interrupts. try to setup a moncal at kessel for a 4 drain.

hd- fight. play your duel interrupts and dueling mains if its the dueling version. use honor, or a spy (play choke if he got elephant man at the theatre) to deal with visage. play smart and remember...you can win without ben/luke/leia if you need to.

bhbm-auto win.



nah, just kidding.
vs bhbm give him luke. put annis stik on leia. drain in space at kessel or rendeli. use ben,and stik so he dont get circled by vader. fight and drain. (oh yeah start wise advise since all bhbm play sac).




any questions, comments, or concerns, please d-mail me.
