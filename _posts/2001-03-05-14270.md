Strategy: '

Again I messed up on my deck take out one X-wing to add in Roche as the Hidden Base System (sigh)


Well Guarded is supposed to be Yarna.


When you use this deck you’ll wanna get out honor agenst about everything that you need it agenst, get out Well Guarded and Rebal fleet and d-d-d-draaaaaaiinnnnn


Here are some strategies agenst other decks 


BHBM 

swarm X-wings in space, get rebal fleet and stop drains. Give them Luke and make em loose a force at the end of thier turn, don’t think about attacking them unless you know they dont have a ghhhk in thier hand and you can really smack em. Use undercover spies to your advantage.


Court 

Pull Honor your first turn. If they start No Escape or get it out get Luke and Obi to a place where they dont have anyone.


SYCFA 

Kill em in space if possible, this will be a pretty fun match up. 


TIES

Play smart. Swarm them where they don’t have guns. If you’re scared about this matchup add in some xwing cannons for one of the Obi’s or both, and some Xwings. 



I hope you enjoy my second Hidden Base Deck... thanks for the suggestions   '
