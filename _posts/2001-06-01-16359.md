Strategy: '

basic strategy

youll probably wait the first turn just podrace and maybe grab order w/ the signal. next turn youll want to set up an alien like chewie or lando at the palace w/ a big guy preferably ben. 

then send in jar jar with bo shuda and get han. the opponet wont want to stay with order hurtin every turn. once han is out leave him with bo shuda so he doesnt get hurt and hurt your opponent with the flip side of your objective.

once your done podracing spread to the arena.

the senses protect you from weapon levitaions, alter, other senses, and stuff you dont want canceled. aura shouldnt be a problem with obis journal, and alter for quietly observing and the sorrys arent the combo because i want high destiny for duels, racing and everything else. i dont have i did it in because so many big blue decks are going out and i dont want to go in space, i should do well with the retrieval on ground.


i dont know what kind of specific decks are going to come out so heres what i expect


hunt down(most will probably duel now) i expect that hunt down will need to duel luke and kill quigon so i have high destinies and end of a reign for dueling and the light side can duel to get rid of vader, send jarjar to get rid of visage and have fun, a jedis focus shoud also help a lot


cpi(without objective) its a scary thought of having someone blow away tatooine, no podracing, no profit, and youll really have fun then, i love this deck idea but jarjar will give it problems . send him in and take over the death star.


cpi(with) send in jar jar early so they cant blow away alderaan, once youve battled away the gunners get back to your routine on tatooine and sense anything they try to do to you.


walker garrison you should be able to take out walker gaiirson with sense, send in quigon and threepio and sense the tramples too, once they’re out of walkers youll be ok


ral ops jar jar and quigon can run in there have just have fun


other than that just try to hold down tatooine im thinkin about taking out one of the youll find im full of surprises for the lightside secret plans which name i cant remember right now to slow down

a million voices.


and for dark deal you should be able to send a few guys into cloud city and beat them down


let me know what decks tatooine has inspired you to make (especially dark decks)
