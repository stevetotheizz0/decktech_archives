Strategy: '

1) Start with Imperial Arrest Order. Try to set up
decree asap by taking out the rebel base docking bays.
Another way to play the deck is to start with
Sunsdown on Coruscant. In this variant, try to
deploy as many generic sites as possible to coruscant
Slap down a star destroyer at coruscant system and
you have free drains and opponent cannot touch you.

2) Once you have decree running, it's just a matter
of running and draining. let the opponent come
after you. he can't do much with nabrun as his
buddy.

3) He'll then try to drain you at some locations
with one or two characters. That's when you plop
down as many troopers (there are quite a few in
the deck) as possible and battle him with
trooper assault. This can cause lots of battle
damage and could win you the game. If not, your
troopers can spread and drain as well.

4) This deck is very simple to play. Drop/run
and drain.

5) Not much fear from the dreaded Draw their Fire/
Frozen Assets combo. Once he drops frozen assets,
play imperial supply and activate force so your
ghhks can go through.

6) Only danger I think so far is Surprise assault.
This really kills the deck. If the local metagame
is assault crazy, I would suggest Boring
Conversation...

7) I'm most happy if someone would critique the
deck design.
