Strategy: '

 
****For some reason their are only 58 cards in here Add in Orrimarko and another fallen portal.****


     You should know how to play throne room by now. Get out your twixes, db and scrubs to them. Choke opponent by giving them no force and by playing cards like aim high and goo nee tays. Take control of their locations . You have enough strength to fight in space or on ground. Bacta tank gives you the advantage in a back and forth battling game. your spies gain entrance to your opponents twixes and can give you a nice drain.

Your superior activation will give you the advantage in card draws and in battle.Use common sense to handle all matchups. 


Not much for strategy but it is extremely simple and obvious to understand. Thanks for reading .  '
