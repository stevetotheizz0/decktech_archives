Strategy: '

Update 1  Take out Coruscant DB for Executor DB.  I know it’s gone if executor dies, but it just makes the setup sooo much faster (piett deploys -2 to executor).


Editor’s Note 1 (in response to reviews) yes i know i

 could drain for more at sullust.  However it takes up a

 card slot that I need, and if I dont get merrejk then I 

really dont need another ZERO floating around in my deck.  

I can drain for enough as it is and trying to control four 

systems is ridiculous.  (with chiraneau and rumors I can 

drain for 11 per turn, plus 1 at the db).


Editor’s Note 2 to ’Jet Nkik’ YOU DUMBA$$ Do you even 

know what Imperial Command does? If you did you wouldn’t 

tell me how WYS and QMC are going to rip me up in space.  

QMC has crappy activation, slow setup, crappy drains, 

expensive ships, and I have already included a matchup 

sectionw for this.  If you took time to read the strategy 

section you would understand.  It is beyond me how you got 

the 1570 rating required for reviews, judging by the 

intelligence you have shown in your review.  And Mon 

Calamari is a better choice than Kashhykk or Sullust 

because

1) I can only be drained for one.

2) I don’t give my opponent two force (Sullust).


Editor’s Note 3 to ’zmanthe 1st’ I never said RST didn’t have lots of characters or lots of starships, I said they were weak.  You may have 15 characters, but most of them are power 1 or 2 scouts, and you may have 10 ships but most of them are like tala 1 or tala 2 or gold squadron 1.  im sooo scared, corporal beezer corporal delevar, corporal midge, brooks carlson, lieutenant blount, and crix madine vs.  darth maul.  please don’t hurt me you big mean person.


**********************************************************


I’ve been having some problems with dark side 

lately, mainly finding a deck that wins.  The 

biggest problem for dark side was activation, and 

I was too lazy to think up something new, so I 

went looking for a deck that starts a 

battleground system.  This is it.  This deck has 

the activation, it has the power, it has the 

drains, and it has enough tech.  Oh yeah no grabbers,

 I just dont like them.  In case your 

opponent plays don’t do that again, just drop a 

bounty hunter ship to endor first turn.  Hence 

the 2x Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and 3x Operational

 as Planned.  Light Side has been weak in space 

lately, obviously. Anyway here’s how the deck 

works


Turn 1 if opponent plays DDTA activate. pull a 

db, pull ominous rumors, then drop a ship to 

endor if you can.  Pull Executor.  Problem solved.


Turn 1 if he doesn’t  pull executor, get an 

admiral (probably piett) with an imp. command.  

activate.  pull a db.  deploy piett.  pull 

merrejk.  deploy merrejk if possible.  pull a 

system.


You should follow the same game-plan in just 

about every game except maybe against MBO and 

RST, just so you can stop them blowing up the 

Death Star or the bunker you can go to yavin 4 

and kill all their guys with the Dark Jedis.  

Fun.  Presence of the Force is your best friend 

then.  In most other games you will pull out 

piett and merrejk, set up docking bay activation, 

pull out systems put ships at the systems, set up 

ominous rumors and start draining.  Smash your 

opponent if he comes to space.  There are two 

landing claw cancellers in there and the AO’s are 

golden.  Most of the time they’ll make the 

opponent’s starships power -2, plus they let you 

pull out your walkers.  You’ve got a great anti-

scrub team in darth maul and DLOTS, great for 

holding the bunker, running around and killing 

random people, whatever you need them for.  Darth 

Maul is great in space, especially against crap 

like ten nunb superstar or x-wings.  Too bad I 

have to borrow Darth Mauls at every tournament.  

This is a solid balanced deck.  Avatar’s version 

was good, but unfortunately walkers can’t go in 

the bunker, which means it will be blown up.  

Also I believed it was weak in space which is why 

there are more ships in this post-tatooine 

version.  Anyway, here’s some reasons for my card 

choices



Operational As Planned x3  I just like it.  Plus 

it helps you get a bh ship first turn if they 

play DDTA.



Control/SFS Goodbye, Captain Han.  Goodbye, Ten 

Nunb.  Whoever’s annoying you.  Crix Madine is 

always a fun target for SFS.



Trample  YAY kill people that mess with your 

db.  what a cool card. great for puny scouts.



Zuckuss in Mist Hunter x2  Well it’s good, and 

it’s cheap, and you can put it out first turn 

with an operation as planned.  Cool.


Umm I’m hoping the rest of the card choices are 

fairly obvious.  If something isn’t, just ask me.


Ok, matchups.  (for most decks start secret 

plans, only against the pile or hb mains start 

the SAC killer)



vs.  RST podracing yay you get completely free 

reign of space.  you’re gonna lose the podrace, 

so don’t sweat it, it’s not that big a deal, 

because they won’t be able to use the second part 

of I did it.  Just stop them blowing the bunker 

at [almost] all cost.  If they’re podracing, 

they’ll be weak on characters.  The space drains 

will kill them.



vs.  RST done right.  oh good you don’t have to 

worry about the podrace, just worry about the 

bunker [a bit] more and you’ll be fine.  Darth 

Maul is your best friend in the bunker, if you 

have him put him there, if you don’t have him, 

get him.  If you’re playing against someone who 

is not Brian Hunter playing this deck, there is a 

high possibility of beating it.  If Brian Hunter 

is playing RST done right, then im probably 

screwed considering the fact that he’s the numero 

uno player in the world. But it’s still 

possible.  They give you some force which helps a 

lot, but the ships are puny and you should be 

able to pound anything that comes to space.  If 

you have darth vader in your hand put him to the 

bunker and then put darth maul at crix’s site to 

neutralize the big pile of scouts they’ll have 

sitting there.



vs.  HB mains wowsers, they have crap for drains 

and you can stop their retrieval with your 

effects.  If you stick to the docking bay on the 

ground you’ll be fine, and your drains in space 

will overwhelm them.  Same thing for the pile and 

other mains decks.  Space is limited to the 

falcon and the spiral and stuff like that, so 

opposition there will be VERY limited.



vs.  any kind of X-wings  Battle Deployment, 

Battle Order and Darth Maul wrecks.  Next.



vs.  MBO go to yavin 4 and kill scrubs.  kill 

random ships in space.



vs.  the PILE  hey cool, force denial.  just 

play cautiously and stay mostly in space.  you’ll 

win. watch out for jar-jar or revo beatdowns at 

the dbs, though.



vs.  QMC  start secret plans.  set up as usual 

and take over bespin when needed.  SFS and darth 

maul are golden as always and you can basically 

ignore their guys at cloud city.  as always the 

ominous rumors/chiraneau drains will be 

overwhelming.



Ok that’s all the matchups i could think of for 

now.  Hope you had a good read, and I would 

appreciate good advice in reviews.
