Flip

Mid-Game
Battle!!!
Send The Hunters around and battle what ever you want Even Hidden Base Gets The Smack Down Thanks To The Objective and Information Exchange you can control the battles and do what needs to be done.
Also You will need to set up a little d for Xizor Guri Is the #1 choice Grotto Is an other good choice.

Late Game
The Battle Damage should have hurt your opponet’s d and Draining should not be a problem have fun though and attack what they have left and win the Game.

Match-ups
Profit-Easy win control auidience chamber battle the mains like crazy capturing is a better option than loss though.

Hidden base-Wait for them to flip then with the team in space find the hidden base. Zuckess hurts them alot.  Personal fav space team is Zuckess and Bossk Two Destiny to Zero.

that Is the way it works and your addvise is welcome. Thanks
