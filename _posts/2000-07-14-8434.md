*Updates*
I took out the anti duel cards and a few others that i found not needed to add in another cc site to drain, a premiere obi for sense alter, a landing claw to cancel space drains and another alter.



Start vs. every deck is always the same with throne room careful planning swamp and farm. Same as always.

Vs. The New Manipulator Deck

Get down an obi or luke quickly. If they are using the new objective they are giving you 2 more force to add to the 5 you generate yourself. This gives you 7 which even with bad feeling have i out allows you to deploy a first or second turn obi or luke. Since you get the first turn you have two turns to get one down to give you a s/a/c guy. There are 3 shocking info's in here and enough sense alter to back them up. Try to get down wise advice just in case you might lose a s/a/c war. There is also goo nee tay in here. So once you take out miyoom with either goo nee tay or shocking info, set some guys up at the carbonite chamber to drain. If they put guys somewhere other than the death star come down and kick the crap out of them, don't bother wasting your guys on the death star because they don't take battle damage.

vs. Hunt Down

There are two transmission terminateds and two spies in here if necessary to cancel visage. The key to this game is gathering a force at the carbonite chamber to drain. Play smartly and you can win.

vs. ISB

come down and murder their guys when they are at their weakest. then spread and drain. Not too hard.

vs. Ral Ops

Get on Raltiir Fast. Use all the starships at the same planet to make sure you don't lose in space. Get guys down quick and cause force loss. Alter bad feeling have i as soon as possible.

If anyone has any suggestions questions or comments please let me know.

Thanks
