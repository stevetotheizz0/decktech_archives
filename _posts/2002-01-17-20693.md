Strategy: '

 
First Turn Pull out the Audience chamber using the Palace game text. Save your force and next turn attempt to deploy Gallid with some back up. 

Mid Game-End Game Play Expand The Empire on the Audience Chamber to pull out even more aliens, Presence Of The Force to add to drains and Hutt Influence to protect your drains from being modified or cancelled. If you can get Occupation running it would be a bonus. If the opponent gets a little over confident you can beat down using Ellis Hellrot.    


Card Choices  

After Her Ok increases their drains but you can make retrieval after a nice beat down using Ellis Hellrot.

Destroyed Homestead A nice drain at the homestead can be made even nicer with the opponent losing a force a turn when they have Luke or Obi Wan on the table

Flagship Bridge and Dagobah Cave 2-0 locations for the activation.


Match Ups 

Hyperdrive A good match up you can kick them off the junkyard with a beat down and drain them silly. Watch out for their mother hard republic dudes with mega forfeits could just sneak into the palace. You should win but it may be close.


We Have A Plan Just try to consolidate your drains against this one. They cannot modify your drains using their objective because of Hutt Influence. Their characters are harder than Mr T so dont even consider a beat down unless you have a good enough force. Dont go to go to space, as Ric is annoying with his battle destinys.


Profit Convert their Audience Chamber and hang onto Han. Their objective allows you to deploy two aliens; my choice would be Gallid and Fett and just consolidate it on your turn. This match up may be the hardest as you are both fighting over the same location but you should win with your hard characters. 


There Is Good In Him/RST Mainly a drain race as midge and co are a nice draining machine. Just get your drains set up quickly.


Senate The only real worry here is that loads of pesky Jedi running about can be a pain and that they can cancel a drain. Dont worry though.


Wys Watch out for multiple battle destinys here and they will be playing on tatooine. If you can mass a beatdown at some where nice like the cantina.
