Strategy: '

I have readjusted this deck for post-JPOTSD. Start Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Wise Advice. You just deploy Master Luke or Ben or someone else big turn 1 to free Han and flip. Then spread. The direct damage should be huge. Try and set up the Cantina shuffle and use docking bay’s for activation and they might fear Fallen Portals but I don’t play any. Use Gift of the Mentor or Weapon Levitation to pull sabers and Skywalkers is for anti-barrier. Lost in the Wilderness is anti-Hunt Down and BHBM. Good battle evasion and Dodge can protect your guys from weapons. Lando is awesome, exclude a guy, bounce someone else with Master Luke, and then beat up whoever is left. Destinies aren’t too bad and has a maximum drain potential of 9 + 5 profit damage. 14 a turn is alot but easy to pull off with mains, etc. You might want to add Fallen Portals or some space if you want.
