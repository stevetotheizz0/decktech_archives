Strategy: 

If LS looks like they will play a ground battle deck, I start with Any Method Necessary to pull Boba Fett, his blaster, his ship, and the security tower.	If LS looks like a space deck, MWYHL, or TIGIH, I start Prepared Defenses to deploy IAO, Mobilization Points, and Crush The Rebellion.

I put in Gall as a system for Boba Fett; with his blaster, you can make one of the hit targets immediately lost.  Even if another bounty hunter gets his gun, Gall will work to your advantage.

Crush The Rebellion is champ to pull I Have You Now so Vader or Emperor truly rock.  Luke is always trying to take on these bad dogs and this interrupt will get you THREE destiny draws!  One Evader is all you need, makes them think twice if they have Revolution and also a good way to recover Vader.

Space is light, but if starting with Any Methods Necessary, Fett in Ship can secure the sector for Dark Deal to set up fast.  Otherwise, wait for Zuckuss to do the job.
