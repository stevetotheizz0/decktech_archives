Strategy: '

**EDIT 1**


 I dont include Lando for one simple reason. Lots of decks nowadays can get Gen. Cal. very early and make your Lando useless.


** END EDIT 1**


**EDIT 2**


Thanks all of you who consider this a good deck AND those who don´t and give constructive critics.


Ditch Control and Sec. Precautions for Main Curse and a third grabber.


Texan Rendili has a -1 force drain for light side too. If you prefer Carida it´s OK but it will make no difference. IAO would be great but actually I prefer my three starting effects (if only I could get four...)


Karrdeshark Mara sure will be good but still trying to find room. Mosep is great for direct damage to reserve deck. I cannot drain too much so it must be done as worst as possible. All too easy doesn´t work in my region, they all are aware of it.


** END EDIT 2**


First of all thanks for reviewing and please, be constructive. Any constructive criticism will be welcome. Everythings explained below. Let me know what you think, dont give it a bad rate just because you dont feel like reading. Thanks.


Ive always loved Carbon Testing, but it never was a strong deck. R2 has come and now CCT is stronger than ever.


I know two tendencies about Jabbas Prize. One prefers not to use it and force a 8 cards loss. Thats great. Ive done it a thousand times, but what do you do after?Nothing.Youve got lots of useless cards. I prefer using the Prize. Opponent loses Han and not the classic scrub character. A great bonus is vs WYS (one of their mains) and every single deck using SuperFalcon.


Another reason is God-Jabba. Once youve flipped Jabba becomes better than Vader (6 power, 7 defense value,  <7 inmune to attr. Plus his own gametext).


The last reason, and not least its just like the film



Basic strategy is simple. Try to get any of your droids (youve got 6) and carry Han to AC while you set up a warm welcome. Then try to battle as much as you can while draining where available.


Enemies


Vs Profit sooo much pleasure. Its a pitty nobody plays this nowadays. Start with objective completed and God-Jabba. What else could you ask for?


Vs RST Tough match-up. Try to complete objective with droids and settle in Jabbas palace/AC. Set yourself for a possible beatdown on Endor, you should be able to do it easily. You’ve got enough power to kick their ass. Take care on space, stay on Rendili to avoid Batlle Plan. Theyll miss General Solo.


Vs EBO Search and destroy him. A few characters can go to frozen Hoth and smack them down hard. Make sure Resistance works for their space drains until you cancel EBO or stablish a stronger drain.


Vs TIGIH battle to death. Your ground force can beat any version. Speeders? Too cold for them


Vs HB swarm Youve got plenty of cards for them. S&D for direct damage and Resistance avoiding huge drains. Let Guri and Xizor pilot their ships and youll be able to be quite strong in space. Watch out for EPPs and win.


Vs HB mains thats what you like most, battling They cant use Han. Use your dirty tricks and you win. Xizor and Guri are a must


Vs MWYHL If they train to 6 they wont have a chance. Loosing Han/Leia or Han/Luke will be simply too much. Vs others try to beatdown if possible and look for your grabber fast. Hard match-up but playing wisely you should win.


Vs QMC quite easy. You will not let them stablish. Grabber and battles will kill them.


Vs WYSthey provide you with Cantina. Thats a great place for draining. If they ever try to come to ground smack them. Once youve control ground S&D them. Play wise in space and don’t forget Secret Plans


Well, thats it Thanks for your patience and enjoy it.
