STRATEGY
With this deck, I try to win. Oh you want my strategy, ok then. Well 1st turn, i deploy one of my DBAYS, and sites in my hand if i have any. If i have KFC, id deploy he because shes deploy 0. or id deploy some scrub like wedge or blount for the extra force next turn. By the middle of the game you should have enough force to deploy your mains, if you havent built a force yet. You should do pretty well against good decks. All the interrupts and effects should help oyu to win the game.

MATCHUPS
hunt Down- Ill just start wise advice, because ill probley expect to jedi test. Ill stick to my regular strategy, and get all my DBAYS out with scrubs to get my activation up, ill go to their sites to flip them back, ha. Visage will be no problem, niether will dueling, with the -3 from dueling from LSJK, and the Courage, and the Glance will help. You should win, unless perhaps you are playing a guy named Brian hunter.

BHBM-
Deploy your Dbays, and give them luke to flip them to lose force. The luke should hold off the duels, because he subtracts three. WIN BATTLES, so you dont lose, thats just a helpful reminder. If you play right, you should win, with youre mains, and all your destiny adders.

ISB-
Lets see- just get blount and some mains to courescent- so they cany flip but they might beat you down there- but hold youre own there and youll eventually win.

Court-
This could be a challenge- deploy to your DBAYS, to get your activation up- then deploy mains. But watch out for None Shall pass, you could start Ounee Taa to slow it down. Just try to beat down. and youll win.

MKOS-
Hmm- same as court its all the same right?

ROPS- Ill start Ounee Ta, because im afraid of that stupid None Shall Pass. Well deploy to Rallitiir, so they cant flip and its not that hard, because you have so many mains, its not funny.

SYCFA ties-
i dont really seen this around this area, so i have no idea how to play it.

-end of matchups-

Props
To britney spears for having nice breastesses
Spirajira- for being so kind to write 7/10ths of this deck
All your reviews because this deck is the funniest one youve seen right? RIGHT?
