This is a re-vamp of one of my favorite decks, including my favorite character, Garindan.

This is the set up:
Garindan + Ket Malis + Dark Jedi Lightsaber + Mandalorian Armor + Vaders Cape = Power 3, Armor 5, Immune To Attrition >5 Matched w/Lone Warrior and Moment Of Triumph and You Overestimate Their Chances =s a nice beating.

This is only a fun deck however I took it to a tournament to see how it would do and it went undefeated. It beat a Hidden Base deck that wasnt all that good and it beat a mains and toys. (I deployed the monster Garindan and they deployes Obi-Wan W/Lightsaber and battles. I played my three cards and got a power of 16 x3 = 48 and that pretty much wiped him out. :)

Essentially you want to get Garindan to a site and just Force Drain with him as much as you can. If your opponent comes to battle let him then you can use your cards and upset him. The Ghhhks are for the mains beat down so that you dont loose alot and the other characters are there for the initiating of battles and retrieving of force via S&V. I put some clouds in there and the Merc. Pilots to make use of the for an additional destiny if I can pull it off.

Like I said its a fun deck so please dont rate me bad because its not that detailed w/how to beat certain decks its only played against 2 and the FDs are good.

Thanks for looking...

Oh, and in case your wondering the backs of all the cards, instead of the Imperial Symbol its a WB Garindan. :) The other reason for the name of the deck.
