Strategy: '

***CARD ERROR***, the techie droid though useful in this deck versus DS space weapons is a mistake. The card I meant to put in was the bantha droid to cancel lateral damage.

Start HB Obj, Frigate, Insurrection, Staging and SquadAss, Tat as HB and of course Rendezvous Point.

Turn one pull tat and tatdb.  Get droid down asap to tat db to use HDWGITM to get your effects, sites as well as anything else you want.  Tonnes of power and dest adders in here.  From there assess what your opponent is doing and rock him/her from east to west.

Versus Tie Swarm = Signal for battle plan asap (or HDWGITM for it) and make sure your beefed up in space.  Itll be tough, but you being strong on space and ground will wear them down.  Most people stock pile cards playing versus HB, especially since your deck will be confusing at first, so use grimtaash to your advantage.

Versus Ral Ops = Get Ounee Ta out ASAP and invade.  Should be fine

Versus BHBM = Well gotta give up Luke, get cards on I feel the conflict.  Destiny in here is decent, and this will be a tough game.  Anakin Skywalker was one of the last pulls.  Might go back in, have to test it in a tourney first.  Pound elsewhere, Luke is neat in this deck, but not necessary like most adder decks.

Versus ISB = Battle Plan ASAP  If they go big blue, you might have troubles.  But again you have enough power and drain potential in here to deal with this.  FA/DTF were 2 other late pulls, might consider putting back in.  Dont be afraid to spread thin and eliminate them one by one if opponent goes PB3.

Versus Force Choke = HDWGITM your sites out asap, with support cards you should be OK.

And remember the ol skool tools of the Tat Shuffle, post errata of course )

Cards you might want to add
Aim High - Retrieval decks might give you issues, an eater wouldnt hurt either.
FA/DTF - For one battle game, set match potential.
Scramble - Make those pilots useless on ground, force them to fight you in space.
Melas - Love this guy
Your Insights Serve you well - Anti Cheese
All My Urchins - Make them hurt to fight you on Tat
Eject Eject - Anti BH ships
Order to Engage - EPP scare squad
Clash of Sabers - Beatdown tech
Efefctive Repairs - Lots of effects, good saving card
ICBW - Obvious

Feel free to add any other suggestions as well, perhaps I hope shes alright.  Thanks
