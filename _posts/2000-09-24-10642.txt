Strategy: '

This Deck is fun to play. Get sombody to the docking bay fast to star activating force i like to put commander merrejk there so he can start pulling systems from my deck there 2 in here so don’t worry about losing one.Against any kind of space deck you can just overpower them and against grond decks just out drain them.I don’t have The deathstar war room in here cause it was the 61 card and i figured that i had enouph activation already plus they drain for 2 there so I took it out.Plaes on’t just say it sucks tell me what to tak ou and what to put in.
