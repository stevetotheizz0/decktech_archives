Starting stuff
Endor Dense Forest, Careful Planning for Farm and Jungle

Object of deck
Spread out early (starting at the Jungle) and begin draining with any Ewok and an Ewok Spearman at each site, while getting Ithorians and Kazak out fast to make the drains hurt more; Graak adds to this much more.
If your opponent decides to take Endor, Ewok Rescue and Sound The Attack will help change your opponent's mind; Anger, Fear, Aggression presses the issue and should provide the big hurt to them.
The mains are reinforcements to the Ewoks, and can attack off-Endor.
Surprise Assault the drains of your opponent, hopefully making big losses for him/her.
Rug Hug can be used for a little extra defensive power, or you can surprise your opponent by pulling it off
Krayt Dragon Howl is good to protect a surviving lone main from a battle you initiated.
Mechanical Failure takes care of damn Walkers.
Lightsaber Proficiency buffs up EPP Luke and EPP Obi and adds 1 to drains if they're left at a site w/o DS presence.
Commander Wedge Antilles and KFC are for forfeit sacking, and keep the mains from dying off from attrition.

Force retrieval engine is Figrin D'an and Nar Shaddaa Wind Chimes on the Spearman for a big one-time retrieval.
