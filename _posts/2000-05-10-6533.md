Wise Advice '

Strategy: '

This deck retrieves, battles on ground mainly, but can Savrip in space fairly well, and uses Tibrin's excellent GT to get cards back. Be careful in space, as it's not too powerful there. Don't worry about flipping either. It's not a drain deck Some examples of gameplay (note in all situations, if Come Here You Big Coward is out, then be at some battlegrounds, and if Secret Plans is out, just save up enough force to pay for the retrieval)

VS ROps - I usually pull Ralltiir first turn and deploy a bunch of ships/guys there once I have enough force to do so. I also cement one of the sites with the EPP/Savrip combo and Sense any nasty Reacts/Masterful Moves. Eject Eject their nastiest BHS.

VS Hunt Down - I'm not worried about Visage, hence only one spy to kill it. I'd worry more about killing Vader quickly so they stay on their own side, while you retrieve away.

VS Endor Ops - it's hard to say. If they flip, your Super Falcon is no longer quite so super. It's hard, but you'll have to fight back some of their sites and hopefully block their drains in space and running away with Hyper Escape (or Houjixing damage)

VS anything else - beat them down on ground and retrieve when you can. It's fairly simple, really.

Notes
I need more space probably Most of you will bicker about that. Don't forget to pay for the retrieval if you have to. Sense and Alter are there to screw Reacts and any nasty interrupts. Good luck  '
