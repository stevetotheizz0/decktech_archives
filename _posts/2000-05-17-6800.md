Strategy: '

Well yes again its a rall ops but its not atst its just a fake for the trooper beat down.

This is how its done very simple yet very painfull.

Start With Well Guarded this will throw your oponent a bit .

Then go through and get your sites wait till u get a ghkk in your hand got through for a non unique aka a storm trooper and delpoy him alone at a site with a mara and a stormie and motti at another site and flip.

Then here is the trap. They see a lone storm trooper and go after him u laught your ass off with a trooper assult and Dark Jedi Presence in your hand with a few storm troopers in your hand
. You ghkkk out of that battle and the start go throug for your darth delpoy him a lot of storm troopes battle trooper assult and dark jedi presence now your troopers that delpoyed for free are now all power 6 immunte to attritian and look really scary.

This should if u r lucky be the end of the game if not recycle and repete again till they learn not to mess with the troopers. If worst comes to worse take it to the sky Zuckuss with vader and tarkin kinda pissed ppl off with them needing ability 7 to draw a destiny then u cansling it.

well i know this deck looks a little weak but with the element of suprise it works a treat..


thanks for lookin  '
