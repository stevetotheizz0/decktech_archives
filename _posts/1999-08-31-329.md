Strategy: '

Start with Presence of the Force against a space deck (or Security Precautions against a Hidden Base deck). Against a ground deck, start with  Battle Order. Go for the early flip (by either deploying to an Executor site and then altering PotF, or by deploying to one of their ground sites) and keep Visage in play at all times. If they come with those nasty mains, kick 'em down, with some great destinies in the deck. Fett and Tarkin can protect the Visage from spies. Duel any Luke/Obi that comes your way (preferable with Tarkin there as well). Dreadnaughts in space for the extra drains, or to probe the opponent's HB. Against a revolver, get Vader out asap and Alter/Sense them to death, Evader also works well if Vader is hard to get down to the table. Please review this deck'
