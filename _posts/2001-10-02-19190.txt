************************EDIT**************************
Well, I am pretty surprised that I have gotten such a great response to this deck.  Since it is actually #2 right now (was #1) I am going to post up a list of some of the cards I would like to have but don’t have room for.... yet.
1.  figrin Dan for retrieval
2.  Sunsdown, tatooine and the power droid to make my jawas power 6
3.  CZ-4 cause he is old school tech that would rule in this deck (lets me deploy characters as a react, my jawas deploy for free)
4.  Maybe some lukes with sticks for a little extra power.
5.  More R*kik D*nec’s, cause he is a pimp.
*******************END EDIT**************



First off, props to everyone who has posted up their Jawa decks and giing me some great ideas for this deck.  Also, keep in mind this is not meant to be an extremely competitive deck.  Its just supposed to be %#@* fun  Anyways, heres the strat.  Also, this is a preliminary version of this deck, and I am posting it to get some advice.  There are probably some cards that would be very useful in here that I dont know about.

The starting effects are pretty basic.  I have DODN/WA because all my effects except the starters can be altered, and its better to make them lose if I am going to lose.  Also, WA lets my effects go to the used pile so i can always signal for them again.  

Anyways, first turn activate and try to deploy Bo Shuda to audience chamber.  Doing this first is key because 
1.  You dont want to get a whoopin at the AC, and 
2.  You can see what is not in your reserve i.e. you know what important cards you activated. 
Try to get your rep to the AC first turn, or if you cant find him at least get Aved Lun there since she can pull ANY jawa during your control phase.  The basic idea is to get your rep (kalit), Aved Lun and Tessek to the AC.  Tessek adds to your drains and makes your jawas deploy for free.  Aved Lun lets you draw jawas, and Kalit makes your jawas power +2 (for a total of power 4).  Equally as important, Kalit makes Jawa Siesta non-unique and doubled and free to deploy.  So therefore, if I get all five of my Siestas out, i have power four, forfeit 11 aliens that deploy for free.  Now thats pretty cool.  I threw in the landos caus he draws an extra destiny and thedit cause he adds a destiny with a Jawa.  Here are some of my interesting card choices.

Bacta Tank  I know it not rare to see, but its not a commonly played card.  If a forfeit an 11 jawa, i might as well be able to take him back into hand  if i have to lose two, I can put one in the tank and then retrieve the other next turn with my objective.  Works well in this deck.

Sandwhirl  An all around cool card for this deck, since jawas are immune to its effects.  if maul is sittin at his landing site, why not just make him missing?  Then deploy a garrison of jawas there to wait for the search party   The only downside is that neither geezum or lando are immune so i have to be careful.

Negative Polarized Power Cupplings + Visored Vision + Thrown Back  this little combo makes for some nice direct damage.  play the cupplings to see their used, use thrown back to discard cards from their hand (also doubles as a reactor terminal) and then play visored vision once or twice (used or lost depending on circumstances) and do some damage.

Jawa Ion Gun  Read the article R*kik D*nec my hero and read what makes this a good card.  Also, R*kik is a jawa pimp 

Magnetic Suction Tube + Kalit*s Sandcrawler + Sandcrawler Loading Bay  This is sort of a side attraction to the deck, but if I can get it to work its pretty sweet.  Basically, suck up some low ability character to the loading bay during your control phase, then deploy a mess of jawas and do some serius damage.  

My Sites  The Hutt Canyon is just insane.  With jawas there, opponent gets no destiny.  That means they have to overpower me, which wont be easy with power 4 guys.  Jundland Wastes gives me a force drain of three, and Jawa Camp gives me some forfeit bonuses.

Anyways, please give me a fair review.  If you think this deck blows (keep in mind its not supposed to win me tournaments) then at least support your opinions.  Thanks for taking time to read this deck.  If anyone wants me to review theirs in return, just drop me a d-mail.  '
