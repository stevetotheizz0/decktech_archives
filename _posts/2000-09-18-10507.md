Strategy: '

General Solo is the frozen captive.  Most of the time youre not going to reteive all 5 cards, let alone 10.  With Secret Plans out, youll only ever have to spend 5 to retreive your starting interrupt.  )

General Solo is Bubo-proof.

General Solo cancels destinies.

The rest of the start is Insurrection, Strike Planning and either of Staging Areas or Do, Or Do Not.  This choice depends on how much of a threat you think SAC will be.

Generals Crix and Lando get pulled before your first turn.  Docking bays come out first Home One, then Tatooine.  Crix usually hits Home One Docking Bay first turn and starts pulling scouts for you while allowing you to activate 2 extra force.

Dont forget that docking bay transit is free from Home One.  Free is free.

Smarter dark side players may assume youre playing with fallen portal, which will make them less likely to attack a later game Crix/Lando duo hanging out under the Tatooine Docking Bay. If you feel inclined, fit a couple in

The flip for this deck is NOT essential.  With 24 characters, many of them able to come directly from your reserve, the deck can play an invasion style, as well as mantain a healthy Or Be Destroyed offensive.

Enjoy.

Post Note  There is an error in the list.  There should be two Leia With Blaster Rifles, not one.
