Strategy: '

I built this deck to be a counter to most popular objective based light decks. There is a counter for almost everything in this deck.

HB - Coruscant, security precautions

MWYHL - Set for Stun, Dark path, masterful move (6)

Harvest - Krayt Dragon -) (trust me)

As you can see I have tried to cover most of the basics.'
