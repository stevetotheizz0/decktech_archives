Strategy: '

-PLEADE IGNORE ALL SAME DECKS BEFORE THIS I accidently kept pressing enter.

First of all I posted this deck and for some reason it wasn’t under my name (it was under some blank name) so I reposted I also forgot to include some strategy notes.

     This deck tries to force drain heavily on Cloud City and also cause force loss with Cloud City Occupation. I just built this deck last night and only tested it twice and didn’t take it to a tournament yet but it won by 28-29 against the Hidden Base and Profit Decks I used it against. Anyway on first turn I pull out Carbonite Chamber and West Gallery (this considerably improves my force activation and is done using I’m Sorry, it is important to check they are in your deck using another searching card such as the objective first). If I have Securtiy Tower or East Platform I also deploy those (Security Tower can be searched for using Sonic Bombardment). Deploy Bespin and Bespin CLoud City as soon as you have them if you are in need of activation, keep them in your hand (and deploy them when you can defend them) if you are activating enough force or if your opponent seems to have many starships. Defend the Cloud City sector using your ties and their matching pilots (I don’t use that many bounty hunter ships because I use the bounty hunters themselves). For Defending the Bespin sytem just be sure you can draw battle destiny and have decent power (Thrawn in Executor or Executor and another starship works very well). After you flip your objective (or while you are trying to get it flipped) spread out on those sites as necessary. Try to get your imperials with your uganaughts for a +4 power and +4 attrition (this way you can draw a destiny of 1 and still surpass the immunity of many charachters). My starting location is Port Town Ditrict. This gives each player one force icon and each player a force drain +1. But one reason that it is worth it is because my aliens deploy -1 there and are power +1. I was also considering to take out the Cloud City docking bay and put in Mobilization Points (just for getting Executor out because I can deal with don’t do that again by putting a starship on Bespin) or Battle Order but I am not sure. Also this deck uses bounty hunting (it can capture in several ways such as All Wrapped Up, various weapons, and hidden weapons) for retrival and is assisted here and there by cards such as All to Easy. 


When playing against Hidden Base play as you normally would, if you think your opponent*s force drains (or force drain blocks) are getting out of hand probe using your estra ships (maybe your bounty hunter ships). 


When playing against Profit you can start with Mara Jade and with Snoova, they can both search for excellent weapons. The only problem is you are depriving yourself of characters that could be working on Cloud City sites. Your opponent might not get to retrieve force because of secret plans. If they set up tough drains on Tatooine you can Just set tougher Drains on Bespin. It might turn out to be a force drain race.


I have yet to play against other decks but I am looking forward to it.


I apoligize for all the inconveniences that occured because of my problems when posting this deck. It was originally posted under the name of Dark City Occupation. '
