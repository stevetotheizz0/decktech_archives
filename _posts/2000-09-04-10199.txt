I think you all can figure it out.  Gets activation of at least 8 on second turn.  Then I deploy to Ralltiir, flip, consolidate to 2 sites (if necessary).  Then it's easy from then on out.  Keep them from flipping you by fortifying, getting AT-ST's for reacting.  Use the Interrupts and Effects to stop them cold.  No, I don't have 18 Vaders, just the 1.  No, I don't have any Maras.  No, I don't have the Emperor or Overseeing it.  This deck still went 2-1 with a +46 differential.  And the one loss was a timed loss I should have won, I just played sloppy.

Strategy: 

Oooopss... I put most the strategy in the card list section.  Well.... you all know how to play Rall Ops.  EBO- get out the Imp Decree, Gravity Shadow, Monnok if it's non unique swarm, etc.  Profit- IG-88 and Sniper work wonders.  Imp Decree takes the saber benefits away.  And so on and so forth.... it's late... oh well.  You all know how to do it.
