Strategy: '

This is an old school deck, is very solid.	Everyone's seen this type of deck and played against or with it.  Do i really need to go into strategy?

Alright fine.

Free Han early or late, depending on the situation.  I usually go
early, but the reason i picked Premiere Han even they I free him right
away is because it gives me the option of waiting if I want, plus
I like his text.

vs BHBM, don't deploy Luke until you see vader, then deploy luke
AWAY from vader, or if you're winning battles, just give him luke.
cause force loss.  Depends on the situation.

How well this deck does is based alot on the skill of the player.
It's a soldid deck that will do well against anything.'
