Strategy: '

Basic Strategy
I always start Security Precautions because I like the extra force activation on the first turn and later on in the game. But any how you want to obviously want to flip the objective ASAP I find that using the Biker Scout Troopers are the best a flipping early because the can react to sites to help defend and I can play High Speed Tactics to get a extra battle destiny or smash a vehicle to the ground. The three most important <> sites to get out are the Forest, Desert, and the Spaceport City cause once you get established you want to pull the Imperial Commander and Expand The Empire. Play them both to the Spaceport City and that gives you a nice bonus in force drains. Ummm&#8230; the rest of it is pretty basic after your settled go crush the rebellion.

Theme Strategies
Vs. You Can Either Profit By This/ OBD
Flip ASAP and pull Secret Plans and go attack characters while draining constantly. Also don&#8217;t start with Mara at the Audience Chamber cause 9 out of 10 time Mara with die and you will have to lose more force then you have too.

Vs. Hidden Base/ SWSTYF
You are already starting with Security Precautions so you don&#8217;t have to worry about pulling it. But you must must must flip the objective ASAP cause this deck has a hard time fighting off very heavy space decks like that, the ships are there to pick off weak targets or prevent them from amassing a fleet. So save the ships in you hand or do as you see fit but once they flip their obj. deploy ships and start probing. If you get the base good for you and at this point it&#8217;s pretty limited on what they can do.  But get out Secret Plans out cause they are probably playing with All Wings Report In.

Vs. Massassi Base Operations/ OIAM
Well what can I say, Flip and then go take over Yavin with Vader, Mara, and GMT. If an attack in space presents its self exploit it.  The odds that they will blow up the Death Star are very slim.

Vs. EBO decks
I don&#8217;t know why but this deck tends to rip them apart. Leave Hoth alone but set up your drains fast because I find that that is the key to winning because EBO is so card intensive. Play Secret Plans to hinder their retrieval and pick off their lone ships.

Vs. Throne Room mains
Well you want to get as much force activation as possible and this is the only deck that I would change my starting effect against so I would make it a Presence Of The Force, deploy it to the Throne Room that way you can deploy straight to the throne room and make you opponent divert their forces from draining to trying to get you out of their throne room. Other then that there is not much you can do except keep a sense ready and waiting to sense their Smoke Screen or stuff like that.

Thanks for the Review -Jake
