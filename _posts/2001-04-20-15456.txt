Strategy: 

***NOTE***
I dont’t have Tala 1, Tala 2, or Blount.  

To ion cannon: The DS can draw multiple destinies.  ECC 4-Lom, Mighty Jabba, ECC IG, and many more.


Ahh, I love this deck.  I love the setup and what it can do.  

Cards:

Access Denied: to stop 3,720 to 1.  I like it better then YISYW(plus I don’t have YISYW)

Turns: Pull COK, pull Wuta, pull a site.  2nd turn, pull Midge, get a ship out.  3rd turn, pull Brooks Carlson, and by now you should have out Gen. Solo. 4th turn, get out another scout, flip.
5th turn, drain for about 5-6.  Retrieve a scout.
7th turn through the rest of the game just drain and retrieve.  I usually win by 10, 15, 20, or higher.

I don’t blow up the Generator because it is too card extensive, but it can help.  I use to blow it up and on one turn, I blew it up they lost 8, and then I drained for 12.  20 force, boom.

I was thinking about putting in Admiral Ackbar to get out my AO faster, so please let me know if I should in the review.

Otherwise, this deck is pretty basic.  

Vs BHBM: You win, drain and kick @$$.  You have no luke, so they can’t flip.  If they duel obi, that is fine.  They get a beatdown next turn from my scouts. 

Vs Court: Go to space and drain on the ground.  Usually, they have no ships or weak ones, so just attrition them away.  Control Tatooine if you see Tatooine Occupation coming.

Vs MKOS: Same as court

Vs HD:  Tough.  I have only played one, and only won by 4.

Any other deck, just drain and retrieve.
