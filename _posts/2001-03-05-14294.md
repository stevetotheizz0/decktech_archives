The Startegy 


This deck is Totally New to me, but I still know the basics of how to play it. Starts out as a basic Hidden Mains Star, but the game has a few little twists. Start Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Strike Planning. Against BHBM start SAC protection DODN/WA. Strt by pulling your Generals, Dagobah, Yodas Hut, Yoda, and Home One docking bay. Put Down Crix to the Home One Docking Bay, pull Geezum and Deploy him to Home One; DB if you can then next turn you can move him over to the TAT DB. Get your sites out to start up Harvest, Celebration, Etc. Next turn pull Tatooine and Tat Docking Bay. Get your character down and then next turn pull Alderaan start you retrival and battling. Drain, Battle, Retrieve, and Win. 


New to me so not to mush strategy. 


Thanks for Reading and Reviewing.  '
