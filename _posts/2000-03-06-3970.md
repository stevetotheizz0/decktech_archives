Objective
Hidden Base  '

Strategy: '

Start either Battle Plan to slow their drains (versud Dark Deal, ISB, or Ops) or start wise Advice for SAC protection and getting out What're You Trying to Push On Us for free. This deck just is almost the same as the Martin Falke version except a bit different. Use Corvettes to load oyur ability 4 guys on. Han, Leia, and Luke go on the Falcon and as soon as you win a battle with them play Legendary Starfighter for some cool damage. Haven should make deploying stuff cheaper.  '
