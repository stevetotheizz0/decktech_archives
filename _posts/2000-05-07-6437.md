Strategy: '

Why Ralltiir? The power available in this deck can easily stand up to the dark side Ralltiir decks and has the same drain potential as any other operitive planet. Now on to why I have (and in some reason havnt) incuded some specific cards...

Zev- Makes the flaps immune to alter.

Farmboy- I have him insteadt of EPP for a few reasons. Cheaper deploy, activates on every turn, immune to attrition, and can screw Hunt Down (hide him in a speeder).

Ithorians-Adds one to drains and activation.

Incom Engnieer- Adds two to battle destiny and speeders are immune to attrition less than 3.

Clash- I did not include this because I have no sabers and even when they have POTF you will still win the drain race.

T-47 Battle Formation- I dont have more of these because I dont need them, just one is deadly and there are huge drains available wihtout them.

Landing Claw- Everyone has something to counter this.

This is probably one of the fastest deck out there. The speeder deploy dirt cheap and the people do too. Flip quickly and oppenent drains are -1. Get the flaps out and start deploying your speeders, if they come to the planey you can kill 'em easily. If they dont, you will have HUGE drains. The drain potential in here is astronomical, the adders (although some are not technacly 'drain adders') are Ithorians, ops, and t-47 battle formation.

Vs rallops- Battle them with flaps out, beatdown, drain when possible. Use harc seff to stop thier drains (if somehow they manage to drain).

Vs HD - Cancel visage. Have luke in a speeder (he cant be epic dueled then) and there objective wont flip. Drain and battle if they come down.

Vs Court- Drain, Drain, Drian.

Vs ISB- Use lost in the wilderness on 5D6 with a tracted destiny. Play I Hope Shes Alright. Drain.

Vs Big Blue- Mech Faliure will hurt 'em. Battle, drain.

Note to everyone Battle Plan will not hurt me that much, most that play it have thier own system available plus I have ralltiir and kessel with the starships to hold 'em. This really is not a problem at all.



UPDATE Take out one Incom and add Wise Advise.  '
