Strategy: '


		    Set up echo base ops with your Baraguins
		    and Lea if possible. Give her the
		    electrobinocs and use her for on the edge.
		    Get luke on Red 5. Have one ship sit
		    at each system then just hyper escape
		    away or use Rebel barrier (there are 2 I
		    forgot to add). This way you can track your
		    destinies with the binocs and know when to
		    use On the Edge and Surprise Assult. Suprise Assult can REALLY hurt with all those sevens
		    Figrin Dann ALmost never loses with the
		    great destiny in this deck. Use the 3
		    Baraguins you can get out to lose then
		    retrive 3 weapons or devices each turn.
		    THis should stop some force loss, but you
		    should do fine with your Figrin daan and On
		    the Edge. Hasnâ€™t Lost 10-0 against
