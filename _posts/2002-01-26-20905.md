Against Profit Start either Jabba and Ephant Mon, or Chall Bekan and Lyn Me. Start the latter if you think you will have trouble getting enough force, or they start the camp. Hold the Audience chamber with a bunch of guys, and none shall pass anyone that deploys there. 


Against QMC Get all three ships out to bespin. If they overpower you there, move to Cloud city for drains. Put a few guys down on tatooine draining and making them lose to your objective. Send in little strike forces of bounty hunters to CC from time to time.
