Strategy: 

ok this deck if you play it right can force drain for 12 a turn. Maybe more if you can shut down your opponent’s objective.

First turn activeate and then depoly any sites you have in your hand then pull a dimond site from your reserve deck. Now depoly any effects you have in your hand, then pull up your activeated force. Do this for a few more turn till you have a strong force of people in your hand. 

Your main fighting force will be Maul Vader Tarkin and Boba Fett and lightsabers. Always keep janus and the emperor together, imperial commander and Commander Igar on tempest 1,Admiral Chiraaneau on the executor, and always arm Coonnel Davod Jon with the assult rifle.

After you have a good defence set up at your ralltir sites use your fighting force to start to take site from your opponent.

Some reasons for cards...
Disruptor pistol hit peole are lost right away same with the assult rifle,

DS2 DB so as the emperor can be deployed,

Imperial commander for the force drain bonus at SP city,

Boba Fett for the 2 extra batlle destinies with vader,

and IG-88 in IG-2000 for some looseable space force if needed.

some match ups

vs. WYS,get your objective flipped the attack palace raider first almost all WYS have them then keep it a drain race and not give up any of your sites

vs. Profit,get out secret plans asap

vs. light saber combat, keep vader and maul on ralltir at the docking bay together

and those are about the only light side decks you see in the tatooine area.
