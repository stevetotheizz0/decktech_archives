Strategy: '

I've cosidered adding another Lateral Damage. For those of you who aren't familiar, this is what these 3 cards do
Commander Merrejk When at scomplink, once during deploy phase may deploy one battleground system from reserve deck.

We're In Attack Position Now
Each pilot deploys -1 (-2 if an admiral) aboard a capital ship. Each capital ship with a pilot character is immune to attrition lees than 4 (or adds 2 to immunity if starship already has immunity). During each of your control phases, opponent loses 1 force for each battleground site your general or commander controls that is related to a system you occupy.

Something Special Planned For Them
Deploy on Table. For opponent to move a starship from same location as your star destroyer requires +2 force. Also, when opponent has just retrieved force using an interrupt or utinni effect card, that card is placed out of play. (immune to alter).

I set up my drains at other systems with no intention of flipping the objective. My starships recieve great benefits from the admiral's orders. I usually start with Something Special.., IAO, and then whatever I feel will be best used depending on what my opponent is using. Pretty straight-forward big blue deck.

NOTE I AM NOT TRYING TO FLIP THE DAMN OBJECTIVE. I DO NOT NEED BIKERS OR WALKERS OR MORE ENDOR SITES )

Aquaris will not hurt my dreadnaughts too bad. I will just move in with my Star Destroyers and take it over. But I do appreciate the concern. If I did drop the dreadnaughts what would I use instead that has that nice of destiny?

Vs. MWYHL
 I haven't had a problem vs. this deck. Even w/o the rumors I get nice drains but I think maybe 2 more systems will be in order.

vs. Super Falcon
My ships all have enough forfeit to handle 1 attack from the Falcon. next turn I will punish them with a severe counter attack and a Lateral Damage. I think I'll be able to work it out....

Edits
CHYBC is now another Lat. Damage.
Tyrant is now Chimaera (just got it)
D* is now Mon Calamari (the 1 less icon but 1 more drain is worth it)
1 Grand Moff Tarkin for Captain Godherdt (cancels landing claw at same system)
1 Dreadnaught-Class Cruiser for Dengar in Punishing 1
Officer Evax is now Admiral Chiraneu (sp?)
1 DSSD is now an Accuser	'
