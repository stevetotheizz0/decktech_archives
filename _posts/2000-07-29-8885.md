Strategy: '

Honor of the Jedi may be out, but I still wanted to try and make a Hunt Down.

Start Prepared Defenses and bust out Mobilization Points, Imperial Arrest Order, and Oppressive Enforcement (or Decree if they start generators).

Search for Rendili before you activate, and then deploy the Executor Docking Bay via Imperial Arrest Order.  Every turn grab another docking bay and you can occupy three battle grounds quickly and painlessly.  Lord Vader holds one, Mara and saber holds another, and walker with pilot holds the third.

Use the Imperial Barriers to protect yourself from massive beatdowns.  Once you spoil his attack, deploy walkers and stuff and apply beatdown.

If your opponent is playing spies, as many EBO decks will, just set Vader or Mara at the Holotheatre and slap Presence of the Force down there, instant battleground, (just don't drain).

The deck just uses quick massive force activation to get out walkers and star destroyers.  Once you have up Visage and Search & Destroy with the docking bays out you're set.

The deck playtested fairly well and if not solid then it is fun to play at least.  Please post up any suggestions you have to better the deck.	Thanks. '
