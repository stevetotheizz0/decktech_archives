Strategy: 

Based on ALL previous reviews this is the final design of the Operations in a can deck. It was advised that I put in more blue machinery: Blizzard 2 for ground, Vaders Shuttle for space. Through countless hours of playtesting I learned that Ominous Rumors was rarely canceled. However there were those freak accidents, so I limited Rumors to 1 and I threw in Deyer who prevents it from being canceled. I have never had it canceled in the early game. It was advised that I play with the Reb Base docking bays for decree. However this would defeat the purpose of my very tech-y Forest and Swamp. If there is no reason to set up decree in the game then with the docking bays I would have wasted cards. The forest and swamp can deploy to Y4 for Decree should I need them, OR IN THE EVENT I DONT they can deploy to Endor giving me even MORE drains in space. This deck is incredibly fast and I have established a drain of AT LEAST 4 by the third turn in every game (The average third turn drain was 7). I think this is a very solid deck...judge it for what its worth now, Im probably not gonna change it more. This WILL be the last version sent in to decktech. For strategy see the original v 1.0 release of the deck.
