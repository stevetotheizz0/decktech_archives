Strategy: '

***UPDATE - Take out the podracer, 2 tramples, and A * indicates a 3rd possible starting effect.


This is my Walker Garrison that Ive been working on lately and I need some feedback with it.  The basic idea is to stay on Hoth doing massive direct damage with Occupation and You May Start Your Landing while getting big drains with the garrison at the 3 hoth sites in the deck.  Decree and Battle Order keeps the opponents drains in check, and when they finally have to try and stop you, tramples and commands will make short work of the rebels.  The fleet is meant to hold Hoth and prevent Menace Fades if possible.


Use IAO to get docking bays and commands to get piett to get merrejk to get systems.  YMSYL gets you the 3rd marker and a garrison to boot.  After setting up your generation, establish dominance on hoth and commence the big damage.  Its that simple, but here are some strategy notes for why certain cards are in here


Locations - all pullable somehow.  Fondor gives a cheap executor, which Im thinking about throwing another one of in.  No other Hoth sites but the 3rd marker and the docking bay because I hate drawing 0s for destiny.


Characters - Your typical admirals and generals here to use with commands.  The 2 most powerful Vaders and Tarkin can go off Hoth to mess with the opponent or help on Hoth.  Arica and U-3PO block drains.  Igar is a monster on the walkers and Evax is 7 forfeit which helps a lot in either space or on the ground.


Vehicles - I may need more here, but this has worked so far with Battle Deployment getting them from reserve for me.


Starships - 2 Chimaeras because thrawn is a beast on it, and I may add Guri to make it the ultimate ship to defend the occupation.  Like I said before, a 2nd Executor or Mob Points may be added to get it quicker.  The rest are just solid.


Admirals Orders - Battle Deployment is just awesome in this deck.  Only 1 destiny for the opponent on Hoth and messes with X-Wings as well.  Dont forget that walkers come out of your reserve also.


Podracer - I know my chances are slim, but I like to give the opponent at least somewhat of a fight for the race.


Interrupts - 3 garrisons is the right number since you wont need more then 2 to be played to win most likely and you get 1 to start.  3 commands seems about right, although Im thinking about changing it around.  Trample is tough with the low destiny in this deck, but you can usually trample UC spies and annoying characters like Harc Seff with relative ease.  A little tracking helps too.  2 advisors because there are a lot of effects that are needed.


Effects - something for everything you go up against.  No Escape because I need the early damage to get through Honor.  Fanfare stops scramble and OTE while allowing me to pull the grappler.  Evereything else is pretty self-explanatory, but I want to fit an Ice Storm in here.


The deck has performed well so far, but i believe there is room for improvement which Im hoping everyone here can help me with.  The destiny is low, but this is a walker deck, and sometimes its inevitable.  Thanks for reading,


Brad
