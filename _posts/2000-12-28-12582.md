Strategy: '

OK Basically you can flip your ojective on the first turn.

Use Insurrection to pull Tat. DB (3rd site) pull Bo shuda(but don&#8217;t deploy it just yet) drop an Elom/Tessek/Tanus at the Audience chamber, and deploy two other cheep characters to two other sites. Flip the objective, and drop Bo shuda. If you still have force left (and have a Signle) get out order to engage and deploy it.

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU ALWAYS SAVE FORCE SO YOU CAN REACT WITH YOU SPEEDERS 

I think this deck is very versitle (but I know it needs work.)

And now BHBM isn’t as much of a problem

You can play this deck in a variety of ways (speeder/flaps/Elom beatdown, super drains, and sneeky traps and reacts.)
