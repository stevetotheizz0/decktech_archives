                      First of all this is a semi-fun, but meant to be tourney usable deck, I felt like a change. 

                      The third effect you start with all depends on the type of deck your playing against, the
                      default effect is most likely Battle Order, it dosent really matter. 
                      If your up against MWYHL or WYS start with Secret Plans, if playing EBO start Imperial
                      Decree. 

                      Before you activate pull out Gall. Deploy Palpy to Endor: DB, sure you may say
                      hes open for a beatdown and if youre the kind of person that is
                      cautious then put him at D*2: DB, but I like to have a force drain on my second turn, also
                      you can pull Force Lightning to protect him, and you may even get Sim, Janus or a
                      Projective Telepathy in your hand. 

                      The deck is simple, BEATDOWN!, if your opponent is chicken @#$% just sit and drain at
                      all your locations, TK-422? No problem, Trample, Han-ish pancake. 

                      Now you may be thinking Visage Of Palpy? Well here is why, first of all, I want to try
                      something intuitive, using the exact same deck for too long just gets boring. You use
                      Masterful Move to first pull the Holotable, then get out Visage and deploy it there like a
                      character, this will give you an almost gauranteed drain of 1 the rest of the game, you
                      may be thinking just 1 isnt much, but it will slowly but surely eat away at your
                      opponent. Also if your opponent gets sick of it, they may deploy Projection Of Luke
                      there, and battle to get rid of Visage, fine you have a good chance of winning that battle
                      and thats another card stacked under Insignificant Rebellion. Not only all that
                      but Visage is a great destiny, Well-Earned Command makes the drain at the Holotable 2
                      and it adds to destinies on Igar. If anybody says that this cant be done, since
                      Visage says deploy on Holotheatre or Conference Room, then you need to read the
                      Glossary under Dejarik Rules. NB: in the end game you can increase your differencial by
                      one (not much, I know) by taking Visage back into hand from the Holotable, and using
                      Reactor Terminal. 

                      Also very small tech - If you so require, at one stage in the game take Visage into hand
                      from the Holotable, use Janus to track you a nice healthy 7. 

                      Do, Or Do Not/Wise Advice is no big issue, you just have to be careful with Sense &
                      Alter, only use them when it comes to the crunch and you absolutely have to. 

                      Arica is cool because you place her at a site with Dr. Es gun, break cover and
                      take out a site, dont be dumb and do this at a site that has Luke, JK. You can,
                      however, have other people at the site, so when Arica breaks cover, she cant
                      be beaten down on, but that sort of defeats the purpose. 

                      Three Vaders are enough for the deck, I always get them within time, and you
                      shouldnt rely on Vader, what if Luke, Rebel Scout gets to him? 

                      Against major decks: 

                      MWYHL: Gall is in here for that very deck, since it has a parsec of 9, you can deploy the
                      Hounds Tooth there, load it up, and move on out to Dagobah. There you will
                      find Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me... err, or maybe you would just prefer to
                      kick the little green elfs head in. 

                      Profit: Deploy Jade and Xizor there at the start, when your turn begins, deploy Palpy,
                      Jades Saber and take Force Lightning into hand, secure? I think so. Then get
                      everthing you have and crawl all over Tatooine. Beat down on those who stand in your
                      way. 

                      EBO: Start Imp. Decree and have a camp out on Hoth, beautiful Summer weather
                      isnt it? 

                      WYS: Start Secret Plans, and smuggle your goons around to take out their smugglers. 

                      TIGIH: There was never good in him and there never will be! You beat on them, they
                      beat on you, tough, but the Darkside always has more power.
