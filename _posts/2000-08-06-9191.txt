Strategy: '

This deck is fairly quick and has two sites with a drain of three. The ability to block two drains with Hidden Base and one with rebel fleet are a huge asset. I have included most of the major played planets in my play area so they can be targeted by The planet farthest from. The destiny is HUGE, drop EPP's and watch your opponents jaw drop when you hit Vader}.
Please dont be too brutal as this is my first posted deck, Thanx.
