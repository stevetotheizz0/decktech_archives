Strategy: 

The idea is to use Power of the Hutt to pull the barge and passenger deck early and pull the 1-0 DB&#8217;s and drop some charcters early for force...the idea is to drop everyone on the sailbarge with Ephant chilling at the Passenger Deck. As soon as possible you use Hutt Influence to get unmodifiable drains at the Jundland Wastes and Lar&#8217;s Farm going with A Ton of Characters at each to stop the onslaught of Mains or Eloms. Use the SAC to stop key interrupts and the Executor and BUS to help against those Space Decks that spread out late game.

With duplicates of all the key cards or the ability to pull them from the reserve, you should do well

Without understanding how decks with change with the new cards from JPSD, I cannot do a real strategy section...maybe after the worlds or more testing I will update it.
