Strategy



Vs. Mains 

You have all the tools to waste this deck. battle effectively until the time is right to duel. You can easily hang with anything he can possibly throw at you on the ground. Use Choke Vader, Sniper, You Are Beaten, and Trample to their fullest. Eventually, there is nothing he can do to stop you from dueling Obi and Luke, and that will polish him off. Oppressive gaurantees he doesnt stop my tracking. I suppose it depends on the player, but this is a matchup that leans heavily in your favor. Ask Matt Lush how hard it is to beat this with a mains deck. 


Vs. EBO 

Ketwol isnt problematic, unless he gets lucky and draws his Transmission Terminated early and pulls the lock with it. Otherwise, Visage will bend him over, along with S+D. Pick Vader up and try to duel. Sure, Ketwol decks have mad destiny, but you win every time when you track or use Tarkin. Against Wings, set up as fast you can, you have to deal as much damage as possible while he scurries to set up. Eliminate his spies. Be wary of Barrier/Ice Storm. Use ships wisely. Bossk and Zuckuss are money when you track. 


Vs. Agents in the court 

This game is pretty easy. I advise you not deploy Vader to the Hutt Trade Route first turn unless you know or seriously feel he doesnt have a Sandwhirl. Some Speeder versions dont use Aliens and Bo Shuda, so sit Vader in the AC if thats the case. If not, put him at a DB until you are given another Tatooine location to put him at where he is safe. Throw your crew to Tatooine, and whip his ass. Fans arent too much of a problem when you Choke, Trample, Sniper, etc. Speeders have always been somewhat difficult, but Visage is so very often   '
