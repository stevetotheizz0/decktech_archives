Strategy: '

this one throws caution to the winds by relying strictly on its’ dueling and its’ personalities’ personal honor to win.  


oni/goblin players won’t usually expect the extra duels like Test of Might and For the Empire...and the extra oomph of Judgement to capitolize on their dishonored peeps.


other cards to throw in  Outmaneuvered by force, Deeds not Words, Imperial Edicts. '
