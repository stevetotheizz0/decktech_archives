Strategy: '

The object of this deck is to win the podrace, then capture luke and get back to the Throne Room. If you can’t get Luke deal them 3 a turn with Your Destiny, drain at the holotable, and drain at a docking bay with Vader or Maul. 

Always get out Palpy to his throne room first or second turn, along with Emperor’s Power. 

If they do give you Luke, play Rise My Friend or DB transit back to DS2. Ininitiate a duel with Vader and Luke, play sith fury. You should draw really high destiny. Win the duel...They lose 9 force. 

This isn’t the most powerful deck, it isn’t going to win an open or worlds. But it can win a local tourney, is fun, and is unexpected. Give it a try.
