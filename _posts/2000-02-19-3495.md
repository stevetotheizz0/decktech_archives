Locations
Use Careful Planning to start Throne Room, Farm, and Swamp allowing you to pull out Nudj's and letting you start first. The rest of the locations, with the exception of Kessel, are for activation.

Characters
They old either have built in weapons or ability 4. Basically for battling and stuff.

Ships
They're just basic ships. Tantive can deploy without presence, Spiral can deploy as a react, the leaders have battle destiny capability, and Lando has good power and immunity.

Interrupts/Effects
Battle PLan will make it extra costly for them to drain and against choke that hurts alot. Beggar will hurt their depleted force. Don't Forget the Droids is for Odds and Courage and Glancing Blow are anti-duel. Frozen Assets and Goo Nee Tay hurt because they won't be activating alot. Tunnel Vision aids getting cards you need. Transmission Terminated is good for Visage and Smoke Screen's are good for battle destinies. Traffic Control is there for stacking destinies and stuff. What're You Tryin To Push On Us is for stacking interrupts.

Others
NUdj's absord DS force icons and Landing Claws are to fulfill Battle Plan.
