Strategy: '

 
Control/Set for Stun should be Control/Set for Stun x2 .

Setup  You always start with IOA and Mob.Pts.
        The default choice for third effect is
        Battle Order, or OE/TINT, if u think
        of moderate to heavy sac.

        On your first Turn, use Imperial Arrest
        Order to look for your Coruscant Docking
        Bay and Rendili. If the DB is not in 
        there, grab the Cloud City one instead.
        Use Mob.Pts. for Rendili.

        You should immediately deploy some
        characters to Xizor, Vigos and Emperor
        at best, because you deploy them for
        free. Move your characters over to the
        Coruscant DB for more force on turn two.

        Turn two  deploy either the Tattoine
        DB or the Cloud City DB (if you don´t 
        already have it on table), deploy some
        more guys to this DB, move your guys
        via transit over and flip.

        The next effect to get would be OE/TINT,
        followed by Search&Destroy and Hutt
        Influcence.

        Usually you will want to concentrate on
        one site first, then slowly spread out
        to cover two, then three BGs to satisfy
        HotJ. When draining at the docking bays
        be aware of Fallen Portal.

        Should your opponent deploy Luke, you now
        have several choices to deal with him 

           You can track one of your docking bays
           still in reserve, or - what will be
           common at this stage - your drain
           location, the Downtown Plaza to Over-
           load his weapon. You can use Palpy´s
           Lightning to kill him, or if your 
           opponent was stupid enough to draw
           twelve cards, Set for Stun him and
           Monnok Luke to the used pile. Of 
           course, that only works with a Luke of
           Ability five - then, you can kill him
           in a good, old-fashioned battle.


When flipped, you can use the objective´s GT to
get a card in used pile, good for tracking,which
helps counter Grimtaash, btw. and in addition to
that, you can look at the cards in your force -
pile, knowing exactly which card lies where, and
how many you should draw.

Matchups 

WYS  Control of the Tattoine System, is what can
      win you game. Without it, he can´t use
      Tattoine Celebration and its a sure bet,
      he will have to pay for each drain via
      Battle Order - most players agree, that
      including additional space locations would
      be counteracting the force-choke.

      So, you should use all of your vessels to
      hold the system. If he comes to you, you
      can Overload any starship weapons, use
      Set for Stun on Dash or Han, to reduce his
      destinies. If he isn´t playing with 
      Raiders and Patrol Crafts , you can get
      Guri up there, too. Use Dengar on the ground
      for pest-control and the Walker to protect
      from EPP Weapons, Sandwhirl and Lost in the
      Wilderness. You can counter Bacta Tank,
      and the high attrition, combined with some
      multiple destines/character removal can
      win you this - just beware Lando´s Vibrator
      and Luke, who can trash Guri.

      If this deck is very popular in your area,
      switch the Masterful Move, Monnok and Ghhhk
      for two Grabbers and Ghhhk/These Rebels ...

      Oh, watch their Lost-Pile for interrupts.

      EBO  Probably one of the hardest matchups.
            How you play it, depends on the
            version youre facing - i believe, the
            X-Wing Swarm version will be the most
            dangerous, because you cannot really
            contest in space here. Dengar in Boat
            really is an asset here, you will
            need Guri and Xizor here, as well.
            Hutt Influence will ensure, that your
            drains and DD comes through.
            Try not to burn your barrier too
            soon, wait till the number of x-wings
            reach a critical level, watch their
            force-pile for a possible Spiral.

            Deadbolt could kill you, if he does
            the lock - for this you could switch
            in one Omni-Box and Main Course.
            Wait, till they play Assets, use
            Main Course, and shuffle their Lost
            Pile, so that no Docking Bay or the
            Assets itself come up.

            With the Baragwin-Retrieval Version,
            you have to be careful. Expect lots
            of high destinies in the seven-range,
            therefore, be mindful of Superfalcon
            and other stuff.

            Overall, with EBO, you have to play
            very smart, or the drains, combined
            with the high battledamage/retrieval
            will do you in.

End of matchups. I will add more, once i get to
playtest this deck fully.

Some card explanations 

Resistance  better than Imp.Decree in here, cosz
i have to occupy three BGs anyway, and i won´t
risk holding two systems, that would leave me
too vulnerable.

Overload  kills EPPs, Luke, Intruder Missiles and
X-Wing Cannons.

Control/Set for Stun  Keycard. removes unwanted
threats and stops Icestorm/Sandstorm - cancels
some high drains.


If i had room, i would try to fit in 
Lateral Damage, a second Sniper/Dark Strike,
a second Barrier and perhaps an AO to counter 
I´ll take the Leader. Fighter Cover, would be
nice, because i still could retrieve with First
Strike and get a drain bonus at the DBs.

Why no Sec.Precautions  Hidden-Base Flip is not
very popular right now, even though, if i wait
and concentrate my forces, i should be able to
do without it.

Why no Projective Telepathy  Mainly, cosz there
is no room. I would have liked one, but then ...

Oh, if those dammed HDWGITM decks are played in
your area, add a Shocking Rev, some grabbers and
Look Sir, Droids.

Hope you like the first deck.
Feel free to comment on whatever you want.

Yours,

Black Leader
