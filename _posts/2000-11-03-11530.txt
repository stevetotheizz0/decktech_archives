Strategy: 

General Idea - Use Janus and sit your big guys
at the Death Star Docking Bay and use Put All Sections on the Alert , Barrier , and The overall
high destiny of the deck to inflict damage on the
opponent. Janus is rough with the high destiny in
the deck because after using him twice you should have high destiny you know on 3 from the bottom , an unknown destiny , and a high destiny you know on the bottom of the deck for battling or Epic dueling. I don’t use Vader’s Saber because its a card slot and you can just throw out EPP Vader when you want to duel.

vs. HB - Security Precautions. Visage and Search
and Destroy = rough game. This is probably the
best deck this deck matches up with.

vs. Anything else - Docking Bay Hunt Down has been around a long time so you should be able to have a good shot versus anything.
