Strategy: '

Okay. Basically, use the good activation platform to set everything up. Then drop 2/3 Senators to flip the objective. 

Win the podrace, to eliminate 6 cards from their deck, and retreive any force you’ve lost by then {probably not more then 6, or your in trouble}.

Use the objective to get your Political effects. Use the political effects to control your opponent and to make Coruscant Maul with The Phantom Menace the best fighting force in the planet. 

Also, if your able to, use the objective to keep their handsize.

This deck is a killer. It beat Micheal Carr by 43/46 some.

Please review this deck fairly, as I built it mostly out of random cards from a box, with a few tweeks here and there to it.
