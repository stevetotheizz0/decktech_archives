Strategy: '

	 First thing you probably Noticed is the 5 epp vaders in this deck, your thinkin grimtash is gonna hurt him.  Most likely not.	I have a twilek and 2 reactor terminals so that any extra vaders i have will go to the reserve.  Event then people put how many grimtashes in there deck, 0, 1, maybe 2?  And with 3 Dr.e and 3 you are beaten epp Vader Can hold his own as well or better as any other Vader. Using Epp vaders also elimates using vaders saber.  3 vader's sabers would lower the destiny in this deck alot.
    Then I only have 5 Sites, and none of them are tix sites.  4 are 2-1 and 1 is a 2-2. Basically all of them give me 2 force and a battle ground to deploy vader at.	If i added Twix sites it significantly lower the destiny.  And with only 14 characters and a vehicles how much activation do you need?
    I also dont have security precautions. Basic reason for this is no good plays hidden base around here.  The only people that do use the special edition x-wings that suck, Basically fett in Slave 1 could take every ship in their deck.  If i do Take it to a regional or something I will probably Replace Oota Goota Solo with security precautions.
    I only included a very light SA Package because When the objective is on the 0 side you basically cant sense anything with the destinies in this deck.  I also included 2 shuthim up or shut him down for D* plans and Bacta tank and a Masterful move for savrip to cancel the more anoying effects instead of more alters because they are both six's.
    I have It's worse in hear because basically anyone who plays It could be worse loses the game when you play it if you have saved up enough force.	And recently some people around hear have been playing with ICBW. Its also a trackable 6.
   This deck has real high destiny with 21 cards 5 or above.  You can hit most people with ease.
    You use tracking to set up your destinies for a duel, but if you are losing or you see that your opponent has really low destiny and you know they dont have glancing blow in their hand or if they dont have a saber you can blind duel. Using dark path first to set up your first destiny as a six or a seven you should win. If you have tarkin along with vader you will win.

I think i covered it all.'
