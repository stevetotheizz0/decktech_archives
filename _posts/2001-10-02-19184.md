Strategy: '

This is ds senate deck i made, its not based on anything else that someone has made so similarities are only coincidental.  Dont smash it cause of that.  Should take control of senate, but be weary of ls type 2 senate decks that can apply beats with new leadership strikes in the initial turns. Use lott dodd to get your watto location and other combo cards like space package use keder wisely.  Use interupts to try and win the race...this deck has opted to just annoy the ls with the podracing...well as the ls senate deck this helped me win a qui so hope both those decks help you out in type 2 tournaments.  Although i had fun with the environment i feel that its to limited rigth now for players, with reflections 3 and theed the type 2 tournaments might fair better.  Good luck and enjoy the decks. '
