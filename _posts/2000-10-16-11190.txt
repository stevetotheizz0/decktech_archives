Introduction I am sure that all of you realize that this is an adaption of the World Champion Dark Deck made by Brian Terwilliger and played by Matt Sokol. I made the deck because I felt with the Tatooine Occupation, it is better suited to play MWYHL with Testing, which is a very big deck in my area. A few of the main differences between the decks are that I dropped other ISB agents for all Outer Rim Scouts and I dropped a Blizzard Walker and the Projected Telepathy’s in order to add 2 Tatooines and 2 Battle Deployments. I also threw around some other various cards to help deal with the decks that are big in my meta.

General Set up some major force activation early and then try to get out the Executor or another ship to Tatooine and set up Battle Deployment and Tatooine Occupation and blow your opponent on Big Drains and direct damage and the sort, of course this is all under perfect conditions, but you should be able to win without any of these cards, just using big drains. One Suggestion that I have is, if you get Tempest Scout 1 out, put two Scouts in it and set it up at the same site as the Sandwhirl, that way,  it is protected and it can react to heighten power at any other site for free. Well, now on to the specs.

vs. MWYHL - This deck is really set up to face up well against all versions of MWYHL, almost all MWYHL decks use power mains, and with decks, a few good Sandwhirls and most of those mains are out of the game. Set up your big drains as fast as you can without putting your Walkers in danger of mains, and drain to death, if they get out JT 1, set up Tatooine Occupation and start to use that for direct damage.

vs. Mains - Another easy win in my oppinion, Sandwhirl some mains, and then beatdown the rest and drain.

vs. EBO - You can usually quickly outdrain an EBO deck, but if you don’t think you can, put down two of the walkers at Hoth and knock them out there.

vs. Profit - Another easy win in my humble opionion, he is usually stuck inside Jabba’s Palace because of the sandwhirls and from in there he can’t really get much going.

vs. Speeders - This is the one deck I really fear, just try to not spread out too much and try to make sure you aren’t losing too many cards from one big battle. With speeders though, you can usually afford to bunch up and just drain at a few sites.
