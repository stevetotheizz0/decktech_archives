Strategy: '

wait before giving me a half star and read if you dont understand dont review send me a message i explain in detail

you just have to put a tie everywhere wait and drain if he deploy imperial barier after that beetdownfor victory
if you expect sense or frozen asset then put more than 1 tie
you got big drain with this deck if your afraid of opps you got bright center you cancel 2 drain with u3po and starfleet + counter assault
this deck is pretty easy to play and have no weekness if you play well and if you wondering why i dont have security precaution?? well you dont need it against space you dont spreed your fleet you wait ubtil he deploy than fight lateral damage+40power+first strike = victory
so you dont need the damage of sp
sorry for my english and have fun killing people '
