***Update #2***
Ok, Bryan, I’ve read your comment, I just don’t agree with it.  I don`t know why you are making it a American vs Canadian/europeen player?. Believe me, all deck that I post on web page here are well tested and are High tournament level.  And by the way, I mentionned the change I made in my first update, you should have read it.  Emperor is not the only character now.  Hey and don`t worry boy, you will probably win the card anyway ). Why attacking Canadian, I think we have proven many time we are good players, not scrub? anyway, I appreciate it...

***update***

Following your critics, I pull out Death star assualt squadron and twilek for 2 EPP vader.  I also pulled out one All power to weapon for a Merrijek. One overload out for There is no try.

***End of update***

***Comments***
I don`t used Always thinking with your stomach and counter for one main reason.  Tie bomber have destiny bonus only in battle destiny or weapon destiny, and since those aren`t the case, il lower my chance of hitting opponent hard. But thx -Avatar-

Also, X-wing cannon aren`t a problem at all since they are destiny 5 and overload kill them pretty easily, this was explained in the deck strategies,  Thx anyway - Jedi Padawan-

Ok here is the tech.

First of all let look at our starting effects.

Oppresive infocement Prevent from having interrupt and effect to lost pile when altered or sensed.  Give a +1 destiny to your 3 dreadnaught and finnaly make your grabber ccost zero.	Very useful card we could say.

Mobilisation Point Mostly for the ability to get Wakeelmui into hand before activating on tuurn one.  Also allow you to activate alot while emperor at docking bay.

Planetary Subjugation Essentiel card while using bomber. Prepared defenses helped this deck alot by the used of many effect right from the start.  Let just say all your bomber are destiny 5 in destiny draw and weapon destiny.  Your scimitar are 7 , not be to negleted.

General Strategies This deck is made for good player for tracking destinies.  Overload need a tracked destiny, missile also for shooting home one down ).  Overload are key strategies in deck (idea come from Mikael Mikalivian(sp?)).  You can easily track a 0 destiny for a fatal blow to .. Jedi luke with saber, Obi with saber, leai for super falcon, han with blaster for profit, X-wing laser cannon (easy draw) etc.  It probebly the easiest way to get rid of han with blaster in a profit deck. Specially while he is with ben kenobi.	Lose a tie from hand of from battle, retrieve it (or went to used pile) track it and kill the bad boy with a weapon.  You can also overload your missile in a end of game for more retrival (short range fighter). Tie bomber dosen`t have much forfeit (2) but scimitar have 4 (useful with SFS to recycle it) those scimitar are destiny 7 in battle and weapon destiny.  Needless to say it help alot.

Offensive strategies Beatdown is pretty easy to make, you don’t need a huge hand.  Just a few ties, lateral damage, dreadnaught and a APTW. Many all power to weapon provide the ability to get many ties fast for early fdraining and/or beatdown.  Having all 2 drain potential location beside kessel help hurting opponent with not much space.  Also, this deck have.. 40 DESTINY OF 4 or more for battle destiny or weapon destiny.  Needless to say you will draw very high in most case. Also, Overload can be used as a very offensive card such as killing leai in a battle agaisnt super falcon, reducing is total destiny by at least 2. Now here is a offensive card, Dearth star squdron.	Why? sinply because once deployed, it is power 12 combined with a all power to weapon give them +6 and immune to attrtion. .. Also retriving 3 for deploying it

Defensive strategies First the retrival engine that is pretty hard to stop.  You have a potential to retrieve up to 21 card pretty easily and maybe even more if there are some battle going on (recycling ties).  Emperor on docking bay is invincible unles hit by a weapon which you should take care with a well place overload.  No battle damage, immune to attrtion allow you to drain alo in space without paying a ton of fore for battle plan.  Grabber help for sense/alter/retrival cards or annoying interrupts.	As a defensive you can also use the shield/sword ability to react with emperor or in space to retrieve 3 then lose it.	Next turn you get him back with a single tie .	Also, you have recycling 7 destiny with missile and scimitar squadron.	If you cannot fire them, lose them from hand and retrieve it and track them.  This way you will have always good destiny in battle.

Finally, you should`t have problem draining them out before he does.

Variant of deck
Some may prefer using Merrijek to get system out, that ok.  Asteroid filed could also be a option, but it a 0 destiny. First strike could also be used, but could goes against u on docking bay. Battle order could be useful, but I take the risk to play without it.

Agaisnt orher decks.

D* 2 objective  Well, if you are lucky or fast enough you can get rid of Luke wirth overload on first turn or before he get to your docking bay.  Once that completed you should overdrain him or beatdown him in space.

Profit Mostly a speed game since profit dosen`t used most space and if he used some he will get killed.  Your retrival should give you the edge and a well tracked 0 overload will slow him down on Han with blaster.	In most case, you will have the edge because of your better retrival and draining possibility (9 a turn).

Hidden base Probing should be a problem, get your force for a beatdown then spread, barrier, ghhhk will help to prevent beatdown from their sides.  Be careful against swarm deck. If this deck is very popular in your area, insert a battle order, this will slow them dow alot.  Don`t be afraid of x-wing cannon, there are lost with overload pretty easily. Avoid, battle, drain, hide, play very carefully and you will be able to get the edge over him.

Mains and toys Easy matchup because you smack him in space and dosen’t do you any battle damage on the ground. Watch out for sense alter grab them fast (using twilek to get grabber)

Others Just play wisely and you should get a win or a very low differential lost.

Don`t forget that when you win, it is with a very high differential, and this is needed to get the edge in high level competition.

I would also like to mentionned that there is a contest this month on Worldnet, one Lord vader will be drawn from all games played on cardtable and reported to it.  One played game = one chance of winning.  Anyway, Send me constructive review and I don`t care much about the prises given for best deck.

I am willing to discuss strategies and what you dosne`t like about this deck.

Thx for reading
