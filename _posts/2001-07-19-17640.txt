Strategy: 

OOps, there should only be two POTF. My bad.
Response to reviews: Well, in the current metagame, the LS tends to give me plenty of battleground sites so packing my own would only lower my destiny. EBO Podracing would not win the Podrace against this deck and EBO is a tough but doable matchup. Putting in Security preacautions and five ships (nor worth putting in any less than five ships IMO) would dilute an otherwise very powerful ground beatdown deck either by lowering my character base or my average destiny. HB is mainly coming back in response to decks like this (see Brian Hunters deck). In other words, if you fear Hidden Base, you should not be playing Hunt Down/Podracing. This is one of the main reasons I am retiring the deck and putting it up, so I can have a decklist of my deck with the best record ever (although Ill concede is just locals.)

Believe it or not, I came up with this idea independently and built it the day Tat came out. I realized the early pressure of Hunt Down with the awesome force swing of podracing (with the threat of more with dueling) was just awesome.

This deck has gone 8-0 in local tournaments, but podracing is getting to be big and people are starting to meta against it so I may switch to something else soon.
Not many sites but you dont need much activation because it goes up as you put down Vader and Palpy and lots of LS decks give you plenty and its more force efficent than it seems...the power is in the interrupts.
Sebulba always wins the podrace. Podracer Collision them if it looks like they might win. Hit Racer and Pit Crews also have their place.
Ive never lost an Epic Duel with this deck. Vaders Anger is a good dueling card because it lets you put your top used card on your reserve. Very good with Operational As Planned, either to stack OAP or put down Visage, move Vader, then duel and stack the Visage. Vaders Anger is also good for helping to hit Qui Gon.
Limited Resources is good after a Podrace has thinned their hand. 
There Is No Conflict helps keep Vader around in this multi-destiny world.
Aurra rocks with Weapon Lev.
Why three Maras and no Mauls? Because I needed a spy and another dueler. I could cut an Aurra, but I would also want to include Mauls saber and I cant find room for that...in the mean time, Aurra uses my oponents sabers =)
Strategy is pretty straightforward...attack early and often. Beatdown when possible because Vader is a one man army (choke you, YAB you, duel you...), otherwise take control of their battlegrounds and POTF them. Qui Gon is a pain, but Mara or Aurra with saber can take care of him if he runs from Vader. If you really cant chase him down, well, the Podrace should give you more staying power.
Dont worry about losing much early on...youll probably retrieve it back. Remember to save for Aim High.
Deck matchups:
vs QMC
Take over the site that lets you cancel drains. Tricky to deal with head on because of Path and other evasion tricks. Win the podrace. Duel if their foolhardy enough to try. Fortify the drek out of a site to prevent Path beatdown...youre set up earlier and theyre just pinging you until they flip, and the fact you have lots of guys on Bespin messes them up. Make them burn paths evading duels.
vs RST
Kill Crix. Take over the landing site or back door, whichever is easier. Save a character or two in hand and some force if they try to go for the bunker. RST is very card intensive so if you win the podrace you have a good chance of taking out some key cards. This deck DID beat a version of Scott Lingrells Podracing/RST. Duel if you can.
vs. WYS
WYS has always had problems with Choke Vader. Run, Luke, Run is unique so if they try to use that with the tripler duel Luke...even if its a blind duel the nasty beat down may mean you have little to lose, and WYS often doesnt have dueling protection beyond RLR. Take over the Cantina. Xizor hurts. Ponda/Dr. E with a guy with saber hurts. Theyll probably be able to cancel Visage with TTs from the lost, though, so hopefully you can set up a decent drain at the Cantina by then. Prioritize rebels who can be targeted by On the Edge in battle. 
vs. Other podracing
Sebulba always wins. If youre worried, start No Escape instead. Remember to start the podrace with their podraces gametext in case they get out Honor.
vs. Mains and Toys
Well, most of these use lots of twixes to set up, and you can give them a run for their money by starting POTF on their starting twix. If its shmis hut, its not worth it because you can deploy at the arena. Mara also invades twixes. Mainly, you want most of the battles to take place at somewhere you can drain them for a lot more than they can drain you. Duel Obi and Luke if you can. 
vs. MWYHL
Tough match...you need to wear them out before they finish. Hopefully with Visage, Podracing, and POTFd bay you can do it. If they test to 2 you can probably win whatever ground battles happen if you just pile guys at the arena.
vs. EBO
Another tough match...you can either hope your direct damage destroys this relatively card intensive deck and set up a big drain at the arena after the race is over, or try to invade Hoth. Fortunately, its not big any more because of Walker Garrison.
vs. TIGIH
There Is No Conflict pulls cards from their stack. Usually TIGIH is a scouts deck, and DVDLOTs hurts scouts a lot. Kill Crix with Mara if you can.
vs AITC
With their guys getting hit by weapons and choked and the podrace damage theres just not much they can do. Take over one of their good sites and hold it and theyll probably spend the rest of the game tying to unload Chadras/Eloms to get rid of Vader and crew.
vs. MBO
Invade Yavin. Take over any sites that hurt attack run. They cant deal with an invasion of Yavin and huge direct damage. 
vs. Flipping Hidden Base
Im not going to lie or exclude it--this is pretty much auto-loss for you. This is why Brian Hunter built Flipping HB to deal with podracing Hunt Down. No, I dont have any ships, but unless Im willing to use 5-6 it does me no good other than a hollow sense of security. Even if I did use space, itd just get beat down and hasten the inevitable. If you are supremely lucky you will win this match by killing their HB marker with podrace or Visage damage. If the CCG Gods smile upon you your opponent may carelessly topdeck their critical card and be unable to flip so you can set up a drain at the arena. If theyre using a universal site to set up Menace or aboid Battle Order or something, count yourself lucky because you MIGHT be able to push through some battle damage (or even dueling damage...remember you can pick up Vader with the 0 side). If you have a barrier you might leave Vader alone so they put down a suicide main and you can smack him. This match is all about your oppontent trying to do something on the ground and luck.
vs DBO
Because I needed something to lift my spirits after the HB matchup =). I have to playtest to see if starting No Escape instead of Wattos box lets you smack around DBO more, but right now Im leaning towards the Box for the retrieval. You invade Datooine. Its Datooine Base Operations vs. Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi. That and if youre opponent is playing DBO hes probably not the greatest. So, yeah, invade Datooine and win.
