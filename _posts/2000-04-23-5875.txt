Strategy: '

Insert ASAP. Make them lose to Odds + AFA. Send an EPP down. Battle, retrieve 1, they lose 1.  Swing, hit, take another person out w/ attrition. Send EPP to tank. Repeat. Simple, but VERY deadly. The destiny in this deck rocks. Get 5’s all the time w/o tracking Went 2-1 at the Washington State Championships, losing only to a guy I caught cheating the next game when I played him again. It kicks @$$. Major props to Scott Lingrell for crating the original deck.

I will be posting a v2 of this in 10 days... '
