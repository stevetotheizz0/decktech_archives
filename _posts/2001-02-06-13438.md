Strategy: '

**That should be None Shall Pass x2. My fault.**


Classic MKOS. Retrieve, battle (not necessarily in that order), and have huge destinies. The game text on the flip side of MKOS is huge, especially when you can draw multiple destinies. You flip with one of your two Abyssins (easy to get because of Ornament and Chall Bekan) and then use Myo to block drains or destinies, battle with him, and send him to the used pile. Thats why Abyssins are the best species for this. Then you pull out all your JP sites and set up Galid + Search and Destroy. Thats amazing damage, and your opponent will have trouble stopping it thanks to No Bargain, None Shall Pass, Barriers, Projective Telepathy, etc. Some particular choices


Sniper/Dark Strike More versatile than the original, despite the lower destiny. Great for setting up beatdown, acting as Dr E, or getting rid of undercover spies. Hutt Smooch is in there for the same reason.


Elis Helrot One is enough, and I wouldnt waste a card slot on IAO. Insurrection is too popular to play more than one, but it can mean a beating if it gets through.


Three Ships? Its all you need. This kills EBO and Hidden Base because of Hutt Influence anyway, but now you can retreive and clear systems because of the destinies.


Jabbas Through With You Adds a destiny for firing a weapon. Youll do that a lot.


No Vibro-Ax? Honestly, I want to, but I cant find the room. If you want me to put one in, tell me what to take out.


Sandwhirl Mad tech for making mains go missing. Any mains deck that cant get into the Palace will try to set up the drain of 2. Sandwhirl stops that.


Baby Jabba Immune to Alter he makes Scum. That is key. Getting Scum Alterd sucks.


Low Activation? NO Everything in here goes dirt cheap. And no 0s floating in the deck. Thats a good thing.


Deckmatchups you can figure out on your own. I trust you. If you have any questions, d-mail me, Ill be happy to hear them. Good luck.
