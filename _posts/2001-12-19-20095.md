Strategy: '

 OK, so I know it is not going to win worlds, but the purpose of this deck is fun. And it did win a tournament here in my hometown last week.


The basic strategy is this. Get Chewie with a Jedi set for a beatdown. Target a key character of the opponent. If the character is Maul or Vader you may want to play Jedi Prescance as your first action. If not play wookie strangle before you even battle. With Merc armor on, and playing Jedi Prescance you will have a 27+destiny against against their character’s power+ability+destiny. Otherwise there is no way they can beat you unless they cancel the card. And that is wy you need Wise Advice in your sideboard in case your Sense/alter counter attack fails. The Wookies will make Wookie Strangle a used inturrupt.


So, if you have Obi, Chewie, and Han in a battle, you will have power of an even 40 with bonuses to your destiny and them minus their most powerful character at that sight. That is, if all goes well. 


Remember, to add a sideboard that defends you, but I would make sure the grabber, WA, and DDTA are in there.


Alright, I don’t have time to explain the cards in this deck. But remember to use Grim and pull him with ST.


Thanks '
