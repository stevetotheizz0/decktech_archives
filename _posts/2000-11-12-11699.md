Strategy: '

First thing to do is pull the generals and then activate. Then use Insurrection to
		 look for a docking bay and to check whats in your force pile. If you drew a signal
		 or ANSB play it and get what you need. If it all goes right you should always
		 have it set up second turn. On the second turn all you need to grab is EBO, if
		 you didnt draw it. Get Incom Corp. out quick. Use the Baragwins and Figrin Dan
		 to retrieve your cards. The catapults are in there just for the destiny. Drawing a 7
		 really hurts the other guy. I hevnt taken this to any tourneys or anything yet, so
		 any advice is appreciated.  '
