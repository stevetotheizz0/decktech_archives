Strategy: '

This deck is great.  It is perfectly balanced between the ability to battle and the ability to drain for lots.  Heres the run down.

vs. Hunt Down - Start Wise Advice.  This stops most SAC.  Be careful.  There are a lot of different Hunt Down archetypes around.  From the Big Blue to dueling to Mind Over Matter.  Cancel Visage quickly and start draining.	You'll win most duels with the high destiny adverage and the duel cards.  Youll drain at the CC sites vs Big Blue and then beat em down when they arent expecting it.	Not too hard.

vs. Ops - Start TPIFF and go beat the hell out of them.  Not hard.  Try to put a ship, any ship, at Dagobah to prevent it from being cancelled.

vs. IAO Beatdown - Drain on Cloud City, and beat em up when they arent looking for it.	Usually they'll drop Vader, Tarkin and some weenie guys at a site.  Go there, exclude Vader and knock the hell out of the remaining guys.

vs. Anything else youll want to go Wise Advice.

This deck, if played properly, is VERY strong.	I guess it takes a while to learn to play for some people.  It took me a week or two to get used to it and then from then on I was almost unstoppable.	I guarantee you it works.'
