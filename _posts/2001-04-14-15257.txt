Strategy: '

Stategy This deck is basically your non-flip, overpower Endor Operations deck. On your first turn, before you activate, grab Perimeter Parol with You Cannot Hide Forever. Then deploy some people down to Endor to set up Ominous Rumours, which you grabbed using the objective. On following turns solidify your control of Endor locations and make sure you control Kessel, Dagobah, Sullust, Endor, and the Endor locations so you can drain for 22 a turn once everything is set up. Use Commander Merrjk to pull the systems. Okay, now I’ll go over the cards in my deck, and why they’re in there.

Endor Operations/Imperial Outpost- I can grab Ominous Rumors
Endor Bunker- the objective makes me deploy it and it’s where Perimeter Patrol goes
Endor Landing Platform- the objective makes me deploy it and I get activation bonuses from Mobilization Points
Prepared Defenses- so I can grab 3 effects that deploy for free 
Imperial Decree- if I control 1 site, and 2 locations, Revolution, and force drain bonuses for my opponent are ignored.
Mobilization Points- so I can activate +1 at Endor Landing Platform (Docking Bay) and +2 if I control.
You Cannot Hide Forever- as stated previously, so I can grab Perimeter Parol
4-LOM With Concussion Rifle- if any EPP beatdown squad comes in, I can cancel their game text
Admiral Chiraneau- good pilot and force drains are +1 at all my systems where I have a Star Destroyer
Admiral Piett- good pilot and so I can grab a commander or Battle Deployment
Arica- in case my opponent is playing EBO and the draining gets huge at a system, this is why I have Arica instead of Mara Jade
Commander Igar- to pilot Tempest 1 or Blizzard 2
Commander Merrjk- to pull systems
Darth Vader with Lightsaber- power also in case of There Is Good In Him, I don’t have room to pack his saber
Guri- power
Grand Admiral Thrawn- good pilot
Grand Moff Tarkin- ahhhhh the infamous duo
Prince Xizor- great fighter, okay pilot
Snoova- power and to capture some @#$%gots
U-3P0- to spy on the traitors
Boba Fett In Slave I- beast with shear power
Bossk In Hound’s Tooth- another beast with shear power
Chimera- Thrawn’s flagship
Dengar In Punishing 1- him and zuckuss are @#$%
Devastator- good power
Thunderflare- some nice power here
Vengeance- just a Star Destroyer so I can get Chiraneau’s bonuses at all systems
Zuckuss In Mist Hunter- him and dengar are @#$%
Blizzard 2- an AT-AT to kick some @#$% and take some names
Tempest 1- for Igar
Tempest Scout 2,3,4, and 6- power and mobility
Vibro Axe- for Snoova
Ominous Rumors- for the drain +2 at other systems
Oppressive Enforcement- SAC protection
Perimeter Patrol- so if some hot-shot that doesn’t read game text sees my Commander Merrjk alone, he has to lose 1 force and the cards he deployed cannot move or battle for the remainder of his turn, so when I move in the troops, he starts to cry
Reactor Terminal- I can’t live without this card. I like to draw, and this allows me to put back the cards I don’t need
Secret Plans- more force drain bonus protection
Security Precautions- for those losers who play Hidden Base
Something Special Planned For Them- goodbye Harvest, and the extra movement force might wreak havoc on their plans
Sunsdown & Too Cold For Speeders- ANSB/EBO/EBG is big here, so drop this on Hoth, and byebye speeders and I can come down with my Vader and Tarkin and destroy the rebel base
Defensive Fire & Hutt Smooch- byebye Bousshie Woushie
Ghhk & Those Rebels Won’t Escape Us- cancel Hyper Escape for X-Wing swarm pussies, and the cancel all remaining battle damage sounds good too =)
Imperial Command- take 1 admiral or general into hand, or I could prevent my opponent from drawing more than 1 battle destiny against my admiral or general or I could draw an extra battle destiny with my admiral or general
Lateral Damage- byebye Mr. Home One
Evader & Monnok- X-Wing Swarm pussies, I’ve got news for you
Sniper & Dark Strike- knock off some mains before the battle
Twi’lek Advisor- pulling some effects baby
Battle Deployment- jeez lueez read the card, it’s awesome for this deck
Endor Back Door- drain for 2
Endor Dark Forest- drain for 2
Endor Forest Clearing- drain for 2
Dagobah- drain for 5 with Chiraneau and Ominous Rumors also force drains at Dagobah sites are canceled if I occupy
Kessel- drain for 4 with Chiraneau and Ominous Rumors also deploy -1 and Kessel Run is canceled
Sullust- drain for 5 with Chiraneau and Ominous Rumors also if I occupy when Haven is canceled, opponent loses 8 Force.  

Thanks for reading all this @#$%.
