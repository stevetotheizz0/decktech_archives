-------------------------------------------------------------

First of all don´t complain about the fact that most of the cards are twice in the deck, I just like it this way

I won´t explain you how to play Profit since most of you have played it before and will get bored.

If you are a newbie and get angry when I say that then just go to my page and look at an other version of this deck.

But I will at least try to explain some of the card choices because it is all the deck is about-)


Card Choices


Characters


I won´t go into detail about using Jedi Lukes and so on I will just let you know why I use for example the B´omarr Monk.As you could see on the decklist there are a few twixes in here and if it comes down to a drain race, this guy is a god.For example at Obi´s Hut You can drain with him for 2 without being stopped by that stupid Imperial Decree.(S)He??? is also an ability 4 character and seems to cancel opponents JP gametext, so he can´t deploy his Chamber.


C-3PO - the main problem this deck had often was that the locations didn´t came out on the table and stayed in my deck.So I decided to use the first time ever an C-3PO in one of my decks to solve this damn problem and to do some easy tracking.


Mains - I use 3 Jedi Lukes cause he is the Pimp and that´s all I have to say about itWell, actually he is destiny 6 and probably the strongest light character up to date.(Qui-Gon is perhaps second; not to mention the one and only Lord Vader for Dark).

The other ones are also in here for direct damage via objective and because of therir nice gametext.

No I don´t use Chewie cause Chewie is gay


Interrupts


Tunnel Vision - addition to C-3PO.


Battle Stuff - Smoke Screen is just a god c  '
