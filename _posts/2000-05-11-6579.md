Strategy: '

This is an EXTREMELY high destiny deck.  It has
a lack of locations, but that is no problem, you
don't need tons of force, and you give the opponent,
count em, 1 icon and only 1 battle ground.

So search for those docking bays from your reserve
with IAO, and plop vader down on the death star.
Go hunting with mara and IGy, and if needed,
vader.

The sheer speed of this deck combined with the
drain of 2 (lightsabre) on the d* plus the visage
loss is too much for most decks to handle.  Combine
that with extremely high destiny, and you're set.
If they decide to battle Vader, Lone warrior,
vader's eye, and put all sections on alert will
make them wish they hadn't.

If they get on the executor, you can always chase
em down, seperate them with you are beaten, and
have mara/igy beat up on the one who runs away again.

Vs Hidden Base
flip your objective and move vader to the meditation
chamber, and get out Security precations as quick
as you can.  With vader sitting at the chamber,
you can draw destiny at one of the systems, and
you're immune to godly amounts of attrtion due to
there destiny's being -2.  Monnok could screw
them over too, if they wait until there system
is probed to smack you down.

Vs speeder/ops
I never see this in my meta, and have never played
against a good version.  My best suggestion would be pray.
if they come to beat up vader, hopefully you got
lone warrior, vaders eye.  you'll waste there forces
and hopefully will only lose vader.  Drop another
vader and commence clean up.  Monnok if you can,
that's why there there.

Vs Throne Room non revo
You'll have no problem beating up there guys.
if you want, mara can go Nudj Hunting.	they'll
have to come to you, and this is where put all
sections on alert plus dueling will easily win
you the game.

Vs throne room Revo
Never see it around here.  If you're worried,
add another Evader.  If you're really worried
about it consider starting with Crush the Rebellion,
although with only the one battle ground, it's
a risk.  Your choice.

Vs Profit
Easy.  Kill Han, kill there other characters,
duel.  You win.  Also, Always thinking with there stomach
can really screw em over if you catch han, luke,
or obi with it. '
