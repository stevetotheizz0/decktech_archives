Strategy: '

Well this deck doesn’t use any Walker Garrisons cause I don’t have them, and they take too long to set up.  However, if you replace the Tempest Scouts with Imperial Walkers, take out Voyeur and put it in.  Anyways...


Expand the Empire is the coolest card I’ve ever seen in SWCCG.  Put it on Defensive Perimeter between Docking Bay and North Ridge (or Ice Plains, whatever) and drain at all of them... 2 from Docking Bay, 3 Defensive, 1 North/Ice.  So that’s 6 from drains.  While you occupy North, Ice, and Defensive so that’s 3 from You May Start damage.  9 a turn from relatively safe locations?  Sweet.  That is, if you can get the Walkers out, but with 11 AT-ATs, it shouldn’t be hard (I really need more, stupid Tempest Scouts).  This deck also activates tons of force (you need to to deploy the beasts).  Use your characters to beat the hell out of him in places, and the 2 Destroyers to hold a cruicial system.  Also, if they aren’t playing Don’t Do That Again or The Camp, then you can deploy to the 3 non-battleground docking bays and activate loads.  Any suggestions (or trade offers with Walker Garrison) would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you, enjoy. '
