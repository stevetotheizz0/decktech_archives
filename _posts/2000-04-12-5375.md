STRATAGY
Well, Normal Start is Imperial Holotable, Twec, & Presence Of The Force (on the table). Try to get one of the Visages out on the Holotable fast and then sit back for a healthy drain of 2 for most of the game. The monnoks & Ghhhks are in there for backing up Visage but they can be used very effectively if you use their game texts. Masterful Move also helps when you need a dejarik or that visage. After setting up the Holodrain proceed to harass your opponent whereever he/she is. On ground you have Darth, Fett, GMT, Mara, & company, and your air fleet is very intimidating with Exucuter and his pals. If you are nuken it out on the ground set up a nice air drain or vice versa to add to your already pesky holodrain. This deck is a lot of fun and normally does well.
