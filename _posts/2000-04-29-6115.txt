Strategy: '

	 First deploy Tatoonie Jabba's Palace (Unless their starting location is that, if it is I start with Tatoonie) and get my Jabba Palace places out. Then I gradually get more activation to have some fun with. If they make the first move I beat them down. If the game is getting boring I force drain at my drain drain locations. '
