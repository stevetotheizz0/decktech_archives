Strategy: '

This fits my meta well using heavy space with just enough to cover ground.
I have no numbers protection, because I haven’t ever seen a numbers deck in my area(Yeah, I’m a scrub).

Counters
BHBM- Give them Luke and just don’t lose battles in space.
Hunt Down- Be careful on the ground, but you should have no trouble in space, since few HD decks risk using the Executor.
TDIGWATT- Get Boushh and TK-422 down to Cloud City.  Try to keep control of Bespin, to keep them from using CC Occ.
SYCFA- A tough matchup.  Just try to use Interrupts well and get OTE out quickly.

Sorry about the short strategy, but I have to get off the computer now.  I will try to add more later. '
