Strategy: 


 Against all dark decks except CCT or a deck that starts at JP you start careful planning/tosche station. Against JP you do the same with the LS jp. Against CCT you do the signal for Scrambled Transmission. This deck works well at getting a good card advantage over the opponent. It then can beatdown with cards like smokescreen and clash of sabers. It has done really well against HDADTJ and ops. It may need a grimtaash or two. Alla round solid good deck with the answers to most common DS decks.
