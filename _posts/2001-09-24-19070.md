Strategy: '

I start off by getting down my undercover spies to block early drains. Then I have many flexible choices Do I use A Gift and have Artoo go around stealing weapons and releasing captives, or do I put him with Chewie and C-3PO for 3 battle destinies?

Do I need Boussh as an undercover spy or can I use Liea for retrieval?

If you can dish it out, this deck can take it. Its main purpose is to be able to win with a large diiferential.

I haven’t gotten around to collecting many E1 cards so feedback on new cards I should use for this deck is greatly appreciated.

You can probably figure out the rest of my game plan, so bring on the ratings '
