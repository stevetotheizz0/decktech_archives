Strategy: '

UPDATE #2 You guys are impossible to please Yeah, IF I play against a super SPACE heavy ISB, i’ll have problems. Yeah, IF I play against a variant TIE deck, I might have problems. GEE, I GUESS THIS DECK MUST SUCK Look people, you can’t prepare for EVERYTHING. Yeah, it WILL have problems against ISB, and I can’t guarantee it will win, but not everyone plays ISB. As a matter of fact, most people DON’T. So lay off the fact that it doesn’t have space. I KNOW THAT What’s important is that it’s a hyperdrain deck, and it can hold and keep the ground against any deck that uses some ground. I could win WORLDS with this deck, and you’d still call it crap. I sometimes wonder why I bother posting my decks.....



Update #1 Ominous Rumours? Are you kidding? That card will almost never see play again just because Menace Fades exists. I doubt I’ll ever see Endor Ops played again for a matter of fact. But yeah, I’m weak against it. )


This is the antidote for Invincible Court as well as a host of other decks. This deck has power, speed and has a variety of suprises.

I’m not much into writing long strategies, but I’ll give the basics.

Vs. Hunt Down If he’s playing Epic Duel, make sure to get the RLR’s and his life will be difficult. GooNeeTay hurts a lot. The only counter to Visage is Horn, but Luke or Ben should always be out anyways. HD isn’t really competition anymore for Profit.

Vs. SYCFA Free Han fast, do damage fast. His drains will set up only slowly, and most versions of SYCFA are space oriented. If he goes in space, it’s a drain war, but you can spread quickly and not be vulnerable to beatdown. Use characters sparsely and keep a reserve for anything that might come down. Ground decks are even better. GNT hurts and quick drains will do him in.

Vs. Court More difficult, but the SAC will be very usefull. Alter Scum asap. He’s not activating much, and GNT will still hurt his non-bounty hunters. Frozen Assets will be invaluable against this deck. Your characters are better, while your interrupts are only battle oriented.

Vs. BHBM That’s what Scout Luke is there 4. But use infini-Luke as often as u can before u give him up. Those 2 BiffShuffles/Desperate Reach will give you a lot of leverage.

Vs. Jabba’s Prize This still isn’t a problem, and carbon freezing decks should be treated exactly as COTVG.

Vs. Agents of Black Sun What’s the point of that objective again?

Vs. ISB I’ve never played vs ISB w/profit, but i’d imagine it would be the closest of all. It would be a drain war, but he’ll have to watch for beatdowns, while I won’t.

This is 1 of 2 decks I’m considering for RamapoCon3, and if enough of you that want to see the 2nd, I’ll post it as well.
