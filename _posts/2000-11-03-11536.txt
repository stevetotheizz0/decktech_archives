Strategy: 

Note: This deck’s only loss was to Brenston by one, in the first game I had ever played with it, so it can win very easily.

Pretty Standard, Just get out agents to flip fast then drain.  If they come down, send walkers and vader, or just run away.

vs. EBO: Decree=Win

vs. HB: Probe, and drain fast. this will be a tough game

vs. Profit: start Chall Bekan and Mara, get an ORS with Chall. Try to keep decree going and keep an agent on tatooine, you should be able to drain them out.

vs. Mains: deploy carefully, and use ghhhk when you need to.  If they have a beat squad, send a bunch of ability 2 guys and walkers, battle and play stunning leader.  Now it is just your people vs. chewbaaca alone. Alter order to engage first, as this will kill you if they have a lot of power.

The reason I put in The Imp. Square instead of Couruscant is so if they play blount, I can put 5D6 there, play Never Yanal to kill blount, and then my objective flips back. That way I don’t need to waste any Characters on Couruscant.  Never Yanal is usefull anyways, to kill undercovers and cracken.  I tried to use as many pilots for agents as I could, to pilot walkers, and I don’t use probe droids because they don’t have ability.
