Strategy: '

I know, i thought this OBJ Blew (pun intended) too. But I built this deck, and now I am not soo sure. The main purpose is to fight with the mains. Im sure you all know how to do it.

I made a mistake in the deck When u review change out an Undercover for an Order to Engage. Also, there are 2 starship lists for some reason. It should be the one with the Redemtion Disregaurd the other.

VS OPS blow the shield with weenies. fight with mains

i think this deck has potential. tell me what u think
