Strategy: 

Incomplete, please do not rate yet.

As this is a really strange deck, I guess that I will have a lot of strategy to type.  I would like it if anyone that rated this deck had read the strategy.  A lot of the cards may seem random, but they aren’t.

First off, this deck has gone undefeated in 3 tournaments, and it wins most of its side games.  2 of the tournaments were locals, and the third was the endor regionals.  It beat John Hawkins by 24.  So, it does work.


Most decks tell u what to do for the first few turns, I won’t do that b/c it varies.  The point of this deck is to go after your opponent and destroy his gameplan.

Choices
What is with the start?  This deck has 57 cards left in reserve when your oppenent will have as few as 50.  I don’t need to waste the four slots on effects either.  Basically this gives me more versatility.

Imperial Holotable
  Believe it or not this has a secondary function.  i will explain later.

P-59 x3
  He is just about the most efficient character available.  I also pack an interrupt that makes him nastier.

Maul’s Ship
  Locks down Han, Chewie, and the Falcon.  All in all helps out space.
