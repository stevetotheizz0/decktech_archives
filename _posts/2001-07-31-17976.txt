Strategy: 

**There are 2 free card slots, I don’t know what else to put in.** 

First Turn-
 If you dont’ get one in your starting hand, pull out a DS Gunner. 
 Also pull out CPI so you don’t have another 0 floating in your reserve deck.

Second Turn-
 Put Gunner in used pile, pull Superlaser.
 Pull DS: War Room
 Move to Parsec 1

Third Turn-
 Pull something that says Death Star, try to get the Gunners out first.
 Move to Alderaan

Fourth Turn-
 If you want you may attempt to blow up Alderaan.
 Pull somethin with Death Star.

During each of your turns draw up so you can start getting ships in your hand. Use Mob. Points to pull Executor. I think that’s it.
