Hey, i’ve decided to delete a couple of reviews so it’s actualy rated higher or something.. seeing as this was one of the best decks i ever played i feel it should be rated higher.


plays like bastians(like no tracking) wys. It has a lot of my own prefrences. people wanted to see it. if u dont know how to play it heres a small low down.


get a guy to tatione or cantina first turn.

get a guy to the other locaion and flip.

set up beat down while draining.

beatdown.

win.


To beatdown do the following. get opponent to no force. get less power then them at a site, then battle. Ive got a bad feeling about this, to double or triple it. on ground, run luke run, in space power pivot and use dash, also arto, ive got a bad feeling. draw ur 2-5 destiny then see ur power is greater by 10, double or triple it and win.


To prevent a smack do the following. Stay flipped and use barrier, hyper escape, and dodge. remember playing stuff from lost pile is good. anyway ur power and total forfeit uslualy comes to a total of 10+ so u cant really be smacked, and plus if they do u just smack em back for a lot more.


oh yeah if you dont understand how to play the deck then i suggest you make it and just play around with it. Then, if u still have trouble then i guess the deck is a little to complicated to play.


this has lost 3 games total. 

once to brian twigg huntdown.

once to jamie abel isb space w/ shaft.

once to david irvines hd with 5 tramples and 7s.

one of those loses shouldnt of happend cause i played it wrong.


oh yeah here are some tough situations that u can plow through with this deck.


force choked? u activate 11 force max on ur own with ur deck, thne with beggar ull be fine.

fast damage? on the edge. battle in space then move away form them with hyper escape.

visage? lose interupts.

ties? beat them up, quick beatdown everywhere.

isb/decree? beat them up and set up menace, this deck dose not lose drain races.


any other questions just ask.
