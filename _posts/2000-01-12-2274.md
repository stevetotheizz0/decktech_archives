Wise Advice '

Strategy: '

The deck uses its flexibility for it, and with the huge number of high destiny cards along with adders, even restricting the destiny to 2 of them wont keep the DS characters on walkers alive... It can drain in space and at the holotable, has order to engage + landing claw to irritate and confuse DS space decks (and make them lose 3 force every turn just for TRYING to drain you at a location).. also has DTF/FA + all those weapons/adders for beatdown and carries duelling protection, Vader protection (OOC), Manipulation Protection (shock), numbers protection (DFTD) and isnt impotent as far as drains.. it also has spies to make it onto the executor and cancel visage, nabruns to teleport if they dont play IAO, and even if they do, strand them at a long location and battle.. tons of nifty stuff in there and lots of paths to victory as well as ample force generation and methods around CHYBC and things like that.. with a little bit of tracking, anyone can win with this...
