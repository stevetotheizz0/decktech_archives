Strategy: 

********************************************************
answer to some reviews -
I use hoth db cause I dont lose it if I lose home one
Bantha droids deploy for two force and If I could I would
just use 4 8d8’s
I chose ackbar cause I got him in foil Hashan would be a bit more wiser though.
SAC is rare in my area cause lots of people play anti sac so i’d rather not waste more than one card slot
Thanks for the reviews and what is mara and no escape gonna do to this deck you dumbass lets play a game Ill let you start with mara and no escape and well see how long you last cause I dont think it does any thing to me in fact lets see people put mara alone cause I will hurt her!
And what part of no escape effects me? I have no non unique sites and I dont play honor so does it mean that when they take the top card back they win or something? Agentsd is a dumb@#$%!
Oh and I actually did leave out a ooc/tt combo card there should be two!

Strategy:
Use how did we get into this mess to get what you need into your hand and get your sites out quick. when your putting back your hand you can put it back in any order so it comes in handy cause you can put destinys back in any order and count them plus mains can go together so if you time it right you get only your mains back and destinys are left.  First turn drop any sites you have and search for a docking bay. If you have them then drop a droid and use how did we get into this mess to draw a new hand and then deploy any more sites you pick up or just draw your force. Other than that is basic mains and toys. Also this deck went 3-0 for me at a geelong tourny and the TD used it and went 2-1 with a loss to me.

VS huntdown.
Main idea is to get vader while hes alone.  use bith shuffle to ruin tracking so he doesnt duel and if he does you have a little protection and you can win(i won 1/2 of duels against me). If not use draw thier fire/Frozen Assets  and battle with Luke, Obi, gift, tfiswto, ands any one else so your power ten plus five destiny minimum to his power 6 or 7 plus destiny. With two sabers you should be able to do a lot of damage. you can even use tfiswto and luke by himself but better the other way. So far ive only played it in a tourny and it went 3-0 for me with wins on average about 16 and the td used it went 2-1 (losing to my huntdown) but the two games he won was by 30 and 31 which makes it obvious that I gotta learn to play! 

Vs Court, MKOS, Scum
Take over the chamber use out of comission to stop aliens coming back.

VS Ralops
Take over the docking bay if they use it and deploy a falcon. Clear thier side of the site and take some people off to flip em back clear space and battle order will make em pay use the minor sac to get rid of some effects and interrupts and if they have lone people at the dbs to use mob points then use corran horn and some cronies to smack em. Flipping them back is what I think the key to victory is.

VS ties (Havent played against)
If they have a vanguard use Bastardized falcon/Draw thier fire/Frozen on it and call it a night but be careful with this cause they might come back next with a swarm and it could be over for you too. If played right most likely a win.

Vs SYC. (Havent played against)
Dont go to the DS unless u have to or they flip other than that hope they put down a battle ground or you will have to go to the ds 

VS BHBM (Havent played against)
Kill Empy. Invade the throne room Dont lose Battles and Try to get Vader and Emp Out of play if not give em jk luke and sit back and battle whenever you want to. Frozen assets, bs/dr will stop barriers.so you can battle whenever you want also be careful of sac and numbers.
