Strategy: '

OK,
This deck uses tibana gas miners clound cars and clouds to drain for at least 3 at each site. all you do is bunch up on 2 or 3 sites and drain like mad, if he/she wants to come to cloud city beat the ship out of them with the mains.

first turn- you would usally get a clouds a tibana gas miner and 2 cloud cars the first hand, deploy the clouds and a cloud car on the cloud. then deploy the site/s and lay down a gas miner.
Hopefully he/she won’t go and kill the miner first turn but be carful.

turn 2- drain for 4 and play more sites and backup for you guys. then hopefully you’ll get Pucumir Thryss which adds 1 to drains.


Do this with the whole game, just make sure you don’t die in space or on ground. Also use the big ships and Lauching the assault and camp on bespin.

This should work and its really fun to play.
