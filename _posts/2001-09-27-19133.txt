Strategy: 

-Edit-
About the activation, this deck generates 14 force on it’s own, and all of the locations are pullable.  Add in the fact that most light decks will give you a few icons from their starting stuff and/or other locations, and activation isn’t a problem.  As for the doubles, yeah, that’s a problem.  The idea, however, is to start getting the ships out of my hand asap, so I deploy as soon as I get a system down.  Remember that the interupt cost 5 to use, so most players don’t use it in the early game.  And if all else fails I can get some of my doubles back with Sith Probe Droids and/or the race.
-End Edit-

Okay, Its for the E1 enviroment only, thats why there are no Vaders or Palpatines.

As I said above, Ive yet to see any sort of light space decks, so setting up a drain of 5 a turn in space alone is pretty easy.

Malastare lets me wait until Ive got the race won to deploy Wattos Box, which is nice.  Ive yet to have problems with the race, the interupts, SAC, Raider, Probe Droids to get back key cards and the good avg destiny has been enough.

The Battleships are great, they draw a destiny with any starfighter, all the Light side ships are starfighters, so all I need is one at a system to get a destiny draw.  Its easy to take out the QRS and/or the Rad VII with the guns, which deploy for free and as a react.

Vs Hyperdrive:  Maul is immune to attrition, and he deploys for free, so getting him over to the Junkyard early is easy, esp. with 5 of him, between 2 of his sticks and 3 Maul strikes, getting his stick is simple too.  So now all theyve got to do at the junkyard is oust Maul and his stick, if they have Qui Gon there Im adding destinies too.

Vs Senate: There are different types of Senatate decks, but I dont think theyre all that strong.  If theyre using Naboo, send Maul there and kill off their people, if theyre using the space/site control deck, that could be harder but overpowering them in space isnt that hard as dark just has more Raw power in space.

Vs Jedi Council deck:  Dont see them, but Id imagine that TPM + Maul + Maul Strikes is golden.
