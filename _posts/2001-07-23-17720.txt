****************************************
Ok, the Tournament was going fine(me losing every game as expected) till I brought this monster against TJ’s Chyna deck, and bladow, the Dark Lord gets hit by the Pedigree.  So, Gangsta B*tch and Afro Puff hop onto Silver Surfer as passengers and pull a drive by on her loppy a$$.  
And, all but 4 cards(Ben Kenobi, Careful Planning, Ardon ’Vapor’ Crell, and the Foil Dark Lord) were white boardered.

If you want to see the 3P0 Family, look for them on the Ghetto Squad page, pictures of all but Indian Chief are there. '
