RESPONSE TO REVIEWS


First off, I have gotten some very good reviews so far, everyone has valid things to say thank to those people.


Now for the actual response bit


More solid space Yeah I know, I would like to add the Falcon and a Captain Han if anything, but no matter what I do I cant go gung-ho in space with this deck, and the best space-players will exploit that. Keeping that in mind, I just use the ships I feel will give me a fighting chance against heavy space, (DSII Wedge on Home One with a pilot in AiR5 is very solid), and to out-fight small space packages.


Secret Plans, CHYBC, and SSPFT should not be a problem True, they should not be a problem...but they are. The lower destiny of On/Off and the diffculty to fully use them, is just to unapealing to remove cards like Smoke Screen and Gift and of the Mentor to make room for them.


”More Strategy” Do you want me to tell you how to play mains? If you are a good player and if you want to become a good player, you need to figure out how to play mains by yourself. This deck is straightforward, an old concept, and is something everyone can play. You don’t need me to tell you how to beat people with it.


I should have played this deck at states...dont know why I didnt. Speaking of states, I play in Washington, and I knew I could win WA states this year, all I would need were the right decks. Unfortuantely, my light deck (a spinoff of Holmans DPC deck that did very well in playtesting), went 1-2, losing to the eventual winner Nick Jones and his Huntdown. The other loss was to eventual runner-up Douglas Harvilla and his Huntdown. My dark deck, (ISB space), went 3-0, beating Derek Snooks WYS, Michael Fortmans WYS, and Matt Byrants Ketwol HDWGITM deck. Going into the last game of the normal tourney, I was 4-1 with +89 differential, I lost that last game to Harvilla who finished at 6-0, whereas the other guy who made it into the final finished at 5-1...+89. Damn. All I had to do was win one more game and I was in...oh well.

	Anyway, the reason I spent time telling you this story is that this deck doesnt need much explaining. It run smooth, plays fun, and can beat everything...not everytime, depends on who play of course, but it can. The only strategy Im going to give is to explain some wacky card choices. 


DSII Wedge Of course I was going to use Corran, using this Wedge just seemed obviouse. A LS Tarkin in the right situation.


Hasshn A scrub for activation that saves me from Lateral Damage. (But be sure to deploy him to the H1 DB)


1 Leia, 2 Hans Against Huntdown, Leia is the most useless character, whereas Han can still battle and drain. 


1 Grabber Brangus Glee...yeah, Brangus Glee.


Dagobah Tunnel Visions I only use TV to get cards, even when I use the combo, all I seem to do is use it to get cards, if a drain is really a problem, I use TV to get a character or ship to stop that drain, I never seem to use Control, so the higher destiny just makes sense.


Only 2 Twixes All you need. With 3 DBs, TVs, and Mirax, 2 is all you need.


Run Luke Run Anti-duel, high destiny made recylable by Mirax, and a chump card for FD against Scum.


Artoo in Red 5 Great ship when used with DSII Wedge (Turn anybody into a Red Squad pilot), and with Mirax you can recycle it easily.


No Retrieval Secret Plans, Come Here you Big Coward, Something Special Planned for Them. The elite players are ready for retrieval, make them waste card slots and get more room for battle

cards.


Thats it, thats my deck. Its good, real good. 


Later, Keith Watabayashi



P.S. I recently re-played Harvillas Huntdown with this and beat hime by like 20 cards. Its good.    '
