Strategy: 

don't tell me blount will beat this deck, you will have so much force with this deck, you will rape blount as soon as he comes down, barrier him, leteral damage him and pound the crap out of him

this deck is based around docking bays, and the fact that if you control the hoth:docking bay and yavin 4:docking bay, the objective flips and imperial decree is in effect

start with imperial arrest, mobilization points and either decree, resistance, or oppresive enforcement depending what kinda deck you are against.  First turn, deploy a 1/0 docking bay and throw down s cheap isb, you should draw one.  Next turn, you generate 6 force by yourself and give your opponent no force.  after this , keep your force generation advantage and take control of hoth and yavin by moving the people off the docking bay you put them on at the beginning.  then concentrate on outdraining

against hidden base : there is enough air in this deck to take out hidden base, get drains in on the ground as best you can until he flips, then get security precaut. out (find it or twi'lek) and find his hidden base with the ships in the deck, there are plenty

against profit : cancel his modifyers, outdrain him and make sure you don't leave yourself too vulnerable, fortify where you go and try to get imperial barrier in hand.  get 5d6 on tattoine to make his drains -1

against training : cancel his force retrieval with come here you big coward, if he gets around this, make sure you get his on the edge with there will be hell to pay.	because of the presence of the force, you can drain for enough without modifyers to kill him

against ebo: just cancel his modifyers, the deck is designed to do it, then he's screwed, jst outdrain him
