Objective

Hidden Base/Systems Will Slip Through Your Fingers

I decided to tell you why each card is/isnâ€™t here.



What, I have no Transmission Terminated/s or even spies
Me thinks they are unnecessary. HDADTJ will die quickly, they need Vader down 1 destiny 1 character. They lose lots. I know, last Sunday all 3 dark decks this deck played were HDADTJ. I won them all.
Numbers defence? Okay that was a joke.
An 'All Wings Report In' would help but I have one not

Strategy: '

The notes beside each card should suffice as a strategy.
Whoooops, forget parsec 1 - 8 rule. replace second dagobah system with another hoth or kashyyyk, whatever takes your fancy. ************Also the strategy beside the astromechs is supposed to say; high destiny, adds power and hyperspeed to corvettes so they can go from coruscant to corulag.************ ************Also beside Toryn and Wedge it is supposed to say; Ability 2 Add 2 pilots with high destiny.************ '
