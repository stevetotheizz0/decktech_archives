Strategy: 

Too much deck space to blow up bunker, the weapons , interrupts to get weapons, the epic event, its easy to flip, plus u drain for a @#$% load, it works, play it


Once they belong to endor they count to flip objective.


This deck uses the new objective to generate and drain for insane amounts.  First turn you will get 6 by your self while giving them 1, awesome. You will be able to pull almost all your sites that give you ton of force that give them only one.  But thats not the best part, that is they all turn into at least drains of 2 if not 3, or maybe even 4.  Well people say well you have to spread out, well not totally, but in case my characters ride skiffs.  Cancel their drain modifiers, so no walker garrison, cancel them from reacting with beezer. Wow.  
First turn before activating you will pull madine and solo.  Activate your usually 7( if they only give you one) Then drop madne and solo for 5 at rebel platfrom, go pull Geezum which for 2 force lets you pull sites, then pull back door( not necessary, if they need the force dont pull it,  pull in later on.)  Then next turn drain pull Panno next turn to help activate MORE!!!!!  Then just keep pulling scouts depending on which cards you have in hand.  Flip you objective hopefully you have a skiff so you can react if they intiate battle or 1 its a trap.  You should drain for tons, plus they cant modify your drains where you have a scout so dont worry about imp decree.  Awesome deck, 7-0 so far
