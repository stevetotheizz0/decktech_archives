Strategy: '

I have never lost a local match with this deck, it is very strong in the air, and almost an even match on ground. It is about the equivalent of a dark side big blue deck, only using starfighters instead of cruisers.


Reasons for cards

Luke and Blaster when against anyone with a high defense value, why the need to track destinies, just take away their immunity to attrion and make them forfeit them instead.


Insurrection lets me get my DB’s out and therefore I am activating 10 force by my third turn or so.


Careful Planning lets me start with 2 locations that give me 2 icons each at the beginning, and this combined with Insurrection, leads to a quick start.


My Starships are all pretty strong, and immune to attrion, which gets even better when i get My admiral Orders out.  CAF gives me a nice power bonus since i use a lot of weapons, and it also gives me 2 chances at hitting things once per turn.


Ten Numb in Blue Squad. 5 fires torpedoes at a +5 destiny against capitals and a +3 against starfighters.  Combine this with Steady Aim, and you have a +9 or +7 destiny draw.  My 3 X-Wing Cannons also have bonuses when fired by Red 8,Red 9, or Red Squadron 4.  With +4 destiny draws that make starfighters lost, this deck can easily take on most TIE decks.


This deck may not be strong against specialized decks, but adding a few cards can block against decks like Podracing etc.

This concludes my deck, I hope u give it a score based on its well-roundedness and reliability.
