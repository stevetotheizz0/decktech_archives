Strategy: '

CARD CHANGE -- Instead of the 2nd Boushh, there should be 1 Legendary Startfighter in this deck


Allright... To win with this deck, you must Harass your oponent with Inserts, Drains in Space and an occasional EPP or 2.

To probe, your opponent must have a spy ship, a ship with hyperspeed 5 or a Presence of the Force. Ships with Hyperspeed 5 are all starfighters... trick is to Barrier them and then shoot them with XWing Laser Cannon. Presence of the Force can be cancelled with You Are Beaten or relocated with I Have A Bad Feeling About This. Spy Ship... well, there's nothing you can do against Mara in Jabba's Space Cruiser, but fortunately that combination is quite rare

Hunt Down & Destroy
Try Bothan Undercover for Visage, flip when nessecary, insert, Undercover Spies to stop drains, Inserts, maybe a Suicide EPP's, whatever it takes just keep on harrassing and draining in space...

Scum & Villainy decks (new objective)
Shoot the Bountyhunter ships, Undercover their drains, play inserts Control of Bothawui makes Undercover immume to Hutt Smooch. A Gift if very nice too.

Endor Operations / Big Blue
This will be a tough match Just hope your space fleet will do fine (fire on their starships, if possible... usually they'll have ZIMH or Boba/SI) Also make use of your Docking&Repair

Ralltiir Operations
It IS possible to win from this deck, but it's a very hard matchup. Best thing you can do is trying to deploy EPP as soon as you can, to give the impression of an EPP beatdown deck, then insert. Control Ralltiir early on Use Tibrin to get good cards back... Xwing Laser Cannon to shoot ships. Undercover their drains, grapple Trample...

In all cases, We're Doomed late in the game is a life-saver. It cuts battle damage, drain damage, direct damage, any kind of damage... With R2-D2 it also rounds that damage down. Usually it isn't Grappled because it's late in the game and your opponent has already grappled your other cards.

Figrin D'an has a destiny of 4 when you occupy Clack'Dor.... You can go either extreme numbers when you see your opponent hasn't got defenses and still have a suicide EPP (or EJP) main if you want to fight a little.

The thing that usually wins you the game is the drains on Coruscant and Kiffex, together with Legendary Starfighter damage, while you 'control' the damage your opponent can cause you with ICBW, Flipped HB, It's A Hit, UC Spies and We're Doomed.  '
