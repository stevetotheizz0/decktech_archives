Strategy: '

After you look at your opening hand, go into your deck and grab Rendili and take it into hand.  Then activate.  Use Imperial Arrest Order to immediately get the Death Star II Docking bay and deploy the mighty Emperor there.  (unless playing against WYS, but Ill explain that later)  Youll be activating for a minimum of 9 on your 2nd turn.  

Solidify your Hoth and Yavin Docking bays with a few characters, but nothing too strong (make sure that all your characters down are at least ablity 3).  You want the LS to commit to one of those locations and when they do play Stunning Leader.  Then on your turn, come down in force and exclude all the mains possible and pick a fight with a smaller character.  (Sniper, YAB, capturing with Iggy....you get the idea)  This deck wins because It can duel successfully, and it inflicts a mass of battle damage.  

Now on to how I play it against certain decks.

Standard WYS  Instead of Deploying the Emperor to the DSII docking bay, deploy him to the Tatooine Docking Bay and immediately grab your Force Lightning.  Back him up with a strong force and wait for some action.  Stunning Leader your way out of any tight situation at the docking bays and in the Cantina.  Then let the dogs out.  

Lewiss WYS  Use the grabbers to get the fallen portals and the harvests.  Dont mess outside for too long unless you get an escape card early.  Concentrate your drains in the cantina and at your docking bays.  Get by Battle Plan by putting a couple of your ships at Rendilli.  Dont mess with Tatooine unless you are sure you can get away with it.  You have to duel against this deck so dont keep the Emperor on Tatooine too long or hell get fried.

HB Mains  A very fun match-up that you will win.  Set a trap at one of your docking bays and wait for the fun.  When the smoke clears, your big guys will have slaughtered some scrub while everyone else just paid admission to watch.  

HBX  Set up at your docking bays ASAP with a saber at each of them.  Once you get Luke, get him up to the Throne room and start dueling.  Search and Destroy and Imperial Decree will insure that your doing much more damage to them than they are to you.  Security Precautions insures that you dont get beat down trying to probe.  

EBO  Same game-plan as with HBX.  With decree going, the game is easy.  

TIGIH  DO NOT DUEL unless you are dang sure that you are going to win.  Otherwise, treat it like a mains and toys deck and wait for your opening. 

Now for some card explanations

Imperial Holotable  Do not deploy this unless youve seen a couple of TTs already hit the lost pile.  Do not deploy this against WYS at all because they can still use them from the lost pile.  

JQuile  I just love this guy.  Tired of Protector Chewie?  Hes excluded.

Rise, My Friend  This card is the pimp. After your opponent is done moving around, play this and get Vader and his stick back into your hand to deploy wherever you want.  Make your opponent pay dearly for trying to spread out. 

Stunning Leader  My answer to the fall of Imperial Barrier.  It basically cancels the battle as long as you dont gap and deploy a scrub when your setting things up.  It works at all enterior sites.....yes, this includes docking bays.  

Why no SAC protection?  Because there isnt a single top level light deck that uses SAC anymore.  Its wasted space.  If you happen to run into one with this deck, just play smart and make them waste them on stuff like the Masterful Moves and the Operational as Planned.  They will use them just so your not setting up your destinies.  

This deck is very fun to play with and it stocks enough hate to cripple the best decks out there.  All the tools are in it, its just all about getting them out and playing it right.  If you have any ?s concering the deck, feel free to D-Mail me.   

Editors Note 4/7/01  Okay, I never expected for this deck to surface on to the top 10 a month after I posted it.  There have been some revisions.  Thrawn, Chammurra, Guri, and a Monokk are in....and I took out Dengar in Punishing one, Security Precautions, Jabba’s Through With You, and Blast Door Controls.  Yes, I sacrificed a little bit in destiny, but it makes it a much more well rounded deck.  And the destinies are still extreemly high overall.  

Why isn’t this a Hunt Down?  Actually, this was my dueling Hunt down deck initially, but everyone in my local meta was seemingly running all anti....so I decided to change it to BHBM.
