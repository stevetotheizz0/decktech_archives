Strategy: '

Bassicaly get out a docking bay each turn, deploy someone to ot so you get activation of 3 at it. Get myoom onith to the Executor docking bay so they canâ€™t move there. USe her and all your force to kill off all unique males in thier hands. Then monnok any doubles. Then if they manage to get anyone else out, just beatdown with your charctors.  Be shure to get vader to a battleground so they lose 3 force from Your Destiny. Luke should stay out of the game, because he will keep getting lost from myoom onith. Have fun with this one, It got me 4th in my last tournie. '
