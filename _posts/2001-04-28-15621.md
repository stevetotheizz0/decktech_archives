Strategy: '

This deck basiclly requires you to do kessel runs.  Normally do them from Ralltier with the Frighter Captain because he doubles the force retrieved (note if possible have a unique smuggler on board the Pulsar Skate - hopefully Melas - so the frighter captain can double x + [ability of unique smuggler]).  If not, then go from Corellia.  Whenever you retrieve force with Kessel Run (starting with your second completed run), be sure to retrieve at least 1 kessel run because then you will be able to do a run again. <g>


Even with the high deploy cost, I prefer to have leia because if I’m in need of a ’lost’ card quick, I can use reflection.  She also adds 1 Light side icon (at extierior sites) so I get some extra force.  Her deployment cost of 13 is offset to 10 if she deploys to Tydirium.  She can also use Anakain’s Lightsaber.  I use the reflections II chewie because he’s a smuggler and has defense value of 4 (and ability 4).


I know/Don’t Get @#$%y are used interrupts when I’m With You Too/Count Me In on table so they are ideal destiny adders to finish off some DS butt.  Place Advantage and Lightsaber Proficy on Luke (at least that’s what i prefer).  The WHAAAAAAAAAOOOOH card is for DS creature decks and for it’s destiny of 7.  Use blaster deflectiion in it’s ’used’ form to stop Leia and Luke from being hit (this especially ticks off DS player when they are using a light sabre).


Remember that the core of this deck is to Kessel Run and keep retrieveing and don’t _EVER_ forget your objective bonuses (to get some more force generation, get some smugglers down on the table to flip the card).  I hope this deck wins games for you as it did for me
