Strategy: 

*response*  I do not need more death star sites or CPI, i can pull cpi twice per game from reserve or lost pile with the card A Million Voices Crying Out.  And death star gunners can be retrieved with an interrupt.  

I will try to add Arica and U-3P0-once i find room



I was sitting around thinking about making someting besides a hunt down, or watto, and this popped into my head.  Racing with SYCFA.  

Hereâ€™s How it works: Jam there racer..draw some high destinies... retrieve 11...flip...retrieve 3 for every star destroyer...sit back...drain

This deck starts out rather slow and that is why podracing was incorporated.  In the time it takes to set up the gunners and some protection at the death star 11 force will most likely be retrieved.  

Not soon after (about 1 turn)  the objective is flipped, systems are pulled, and Thrawn plops down on his Chimaera and drains for atleast 4.  

With Chiraneau and presence of the force this deck can drain for 17 per turn.

If you see any problems with the racing cards I used please tell me.  Also I am thinking about using Arica and U-3P0, but I cannot find room.  

All advice is welcome..

Thanks
