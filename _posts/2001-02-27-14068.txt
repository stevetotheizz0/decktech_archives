Strategy: 

UPDATE: *CHANGE HYPERESCAPE TO MENACE FADES*

HISTORY:

After first seeing the Watch Your Step objective, Clint Hays and I discussed its potential.  He mentioned using Palace Raiders for site control and piloted starships for system control.  Then while attempting to construct the best WYS, I realized the full potential of multiple destinies and the unbelievable game control achieved with indefensible SAC immunity and recurring interrupts.  After a meager Harvest WYS version was finally constructed, I consorted with renowned Decktech editorialist Matt Lush about some of the finer points of WYS tech, and (after some further tweaking and playtesting) ended up with what you see here.

STRATEGY:

The basic strategy is simple: CONTROL THE SYSTEM!  If you lose control of the Tatooine system, you lose the game.  So your first few turns, pull out your pilots and their ships (deploy them to the SP:DB for fewer Force and fly them up for free), and make sure you get 7 ability there (for Zuckass defense).  Then you flip by dropping a Raider or two at the docking bays and viola: youre in business!  In the mid-game drop the Farm and the Lars family to the Farm and start Harvesting all your lost cards back (use the C&TVs to get them out).  Once Battle Plan, Menace Fades, and Tat Cel come down, game over.

QUESTIONS:

How do you deal with the Cantina?
Obviously the Crafts cant go indoors, so I usually let Luke and a couple random smugglers (Talon Karde and Chewie are always good) deal with the Cantina.  If the opponent fortifies it heavily, just spread with Crafts outside and out-retrieve the damage.

Why the R2 & 3PO + Artoo, IHABFAT combo?
In detailed deck analysis, two of the problem matchups were heavy Star Destroyers (with multiple destinies using Commands, Bossk, Thrawn, etc.) and ISB/5D6 shutdown.  Therefore, this two-card combo solves both problems.  By putting R2/3PO on a ship: R2IHABFAT wrecks ALL the opponents destinies (by only playing it during the opponents turn and constantly retrieving it with Celebration in your turn), and 5D6 is no longer a threat (just attack him).

Why no Kessel or Kessel Runs?
With Battle Plan as one of your strongest commodities, you cant afford to provide your opponent with an alternative battleground system for his ships.  Also, the Force deprivation this deck allows can only suffer by deploying Kessel.  And finally, the drain of 3 is unnecessary for victory.  As far as Kessel Runs go, they arent worth it; the Harvest retrieval engine is much more efficient and cant get totally wrecked by a tracked zero for destiny. 

Why Houjix and not the Houjix combo?
Sunsdown & Too Cold For Speeders is game over for you.  Therefore, the two Houjixs are included to cancel Sunsdown.  Also, they are helpful vs. a beatdown so you can spread your forces more easily.

Why Nar Shadaa & OOS and not the higher destiny Nar Shadaa?
The Out of Somewhere function on this combo card can work wonders.  If your forces are thin, you can save one Patrol Craft in your hand with this card.  Then when your opponent piles on you and attacks, react by deploying the Craft, then play Out Of Somewhere to deploy a Raider on it from your reserve deck.  Then you get an unexpected 3 battle destinies and you get to watch your opponents jaw drop.

Why Ill Take The Leader?
This AO does everything you need.  You get added immunity to your ships.  You cripple TIE swarms.  Relocating your forfeited starfighters can sometimes be helpful.  And most importantly, your two docking bays get added drain bonuses.  This card is great in this deck.

Why just 3 ships?
Trust me!  Thats all you need.  Play it and youll see.

Just three extra locations?
Any more would clutter the deck.  The four Tatooine locations provided give you more than enough breathing room to set up a formidable Celebration and a modest force drain.  Your activation will be plenty with the bonuses from WYS and Staging Areas.  And besides, the Raiders work everywhere exterior, so wherever the opponent goes, you can go there too.

What do you do about Dengar w/gun?
If your opponent tries to ambush your Crafts with this beast, you have some options:  you can Barrier or Fallen Portal him away; you can just take the hit, Houjix the damage, then avoid him altogether; or you can let Chewie cancel his text until you kill him.

What do you do about Guri?
Guri can be nasty, but she can only hold one location.  EPP Luke is a good way to get rid of her, but if she survives, just avoid her.  If she comes to space, just keep fighting her with your one destiny draw until she dies.  Guri is the single most problematic card against this deck, but shes not THAT bad; you can always deal with her somehow.  Just play smart.

What if your Harvests get grabbed or your opponent puts out a Stormtrooper?
Who cares?  You can still retrieve with Celebration, and your battling capabilities should still be able to control the opponent enough to win the game.  Harvests are a luxury, not a necessity.

DECK MATCHUPS:

VS. Huntdown
Cancel Visage whenever your OOC/TT comes up (if it gets canceled somehow, just play it again from the Lost Pile).  If you can, kill Vader with attrition whenever possible (and look for opportunities to OOC him).  Once you have the system under control, your opponent will be struggling to deal with your retrieval and your drains will save you.  This can be a tough matchup if your opponent has all the right cards in his deck, but you will always have a good chance of beating a HDADTJ opponent.

VS. Scum (Court, MKOS, and SYC/Scum)
Since Bounty Hunters have a hard time fighting in space, this game should be a breeze.  Once the system is under control, Battle Plan and Celebration wreck havoc on his alien swarms.  The Patrol Crafts are immune to weapons (other than Dengar), Disarmeds, Hidden Weapons, and any other tricks so your fighting capabilities are uninhibited.  And since most aliens have measly forfeit, your high destiny draws will clear sites with ease.  This opponent is usually no sweat.  But a quick Gailid setup can be problematic, so if Scum is big in your area, swap in Menace Fades and game over.

VS. BHBM
You can use Luke early for some extra activation at the bays.  And since BHBM decks are usually just glorified Mains and Toys, your battling engine with the Harvests and Celebration tricks will give you the game almost every time.

VS. ISB
This can be a difficult opponent, but you have all you should need to win.  Use R2/3PO to whack 5D6 and try to fight off any remaining agents where possible.  Take full advantage of your Admirals Order and the Cantina (if possible) for drains and let your retrieval outdo your opponents damage.  Play smart and you should win.

VS. TIEs
This is a very difficult matchup.  If your Admirals Order doesnt work, you will probably lose the system.  Play chicken as much as you can with his fleet so you can satisfy Battle Order and use Mirax to track your Harvests around so you can keep a steady retrieval going.  Move to Wakeelmui when possible to increase his deploy costs.  Otherwise just spread and drain as much as possible and with some good play and with a little luck, you should be okay.

VS. Endor Operations
As long as your opponent isn’t using Bikers, you should be OK.  Just work your deck as intended and ignore Endor until you have a decent setup on on Tatooine.  If your opponent does actually go for the flip, i might recommend invading Endor earlier.  Once he flips, your added destinies are meaningless and you could have a hard time battling.  But just play smart and you should be fine.

VS. ROPS/Walkers
Move a ship to Ralltir early.  Use your Raiders and aliens on Ralltir exclusively.  Your high-forfeit and massive battle destinies will win this game.  This game is a breeze as long as Ralltir stays unflipped.

VS. ROPS/Bikers
This is by far the most difficult matchup.  Since High Speed Tactics absolutely owns your Raiders, you cant use your Crafts.  And since all the bikers are Stormtroopers, Harvest is useless.  And as long as ROPS is flipped, you have no drains.  Basically, you should do your best to keep your opponent on the 0 side (move a ship to Ralltir early, drop swarms of aliens at his sites, etc.) or you lose.

Basically, this deck has the capability to handle almost anything thrown at it.  It has amazing battling potential, invincible SAC defense, a strong retrieval engine, and versatile playing options.  I have played against and defeated several decks that were built with the specific purpose to beat this deck (i.e. decks with multiple grabbers, Secret Plans, Something Special, Guris, Imperial Commands, TIE swarms, etc.) not to mention several other basic Dark decks.  In my opinion, this is by far the most solid Light Side deck on the market (placing 4th, 5th, and 6th at the Normal DPC) and will continue to be a formidable force in the future meta.
