Strategy: '

Well there you have it. This deck has done well for me, although it hasn't seen tourney play (like all of my decks because I don't get out to tourneys that often). I'm not sure if mixing Sabacc with Hunt Down has been done or is even a good idea, but I like Sabacc and I like Hunt Down, so there P

Here are some notes on cards that may not seem useful on the surface

The walkers are in for protection against Lost In The Wilderness, which is a card commonly used against me. They also augment the shortage of characters.

A Real Hero-gets Lobot from Reserve (Used), or gets you 2 extra battle destiny with Lando or the ability to cancel an opponent's battle destiny. Combine with Tarkin (cancels w/Vader) and Crush The Rebellion (opponent draws no more than 2 battle destiny at mobile sites) for extra fun ) I should probably put in another of these, but I can't find room.

Any Methods Necessary-I just KNOW that people are going to question this...my only defense is that it gets the Security Tower which gets your Lando out early and Boba to back him up or BFiS1 against space decks.

and finally, the Sabacc...I have read a couple people's thoughts on Sabacc being an underrated strategy, and I must agree...especially with Lando at the Casino, he can add or subtract 1 from your total and retrieves 3 Force when you win. Plus if your opponent draws more cards for their hand to beat you, then if you win you get to see more of their deck plus pick a card to be lost or stolen. Played early and often enough, this could potentially get anti-HD cards like Glancing Blow/Courage and maybe TT out of their hands before they can use them.

Also, since the deck has the same start every time, and I don't get much experience against different deck types, I feel that I can't provide a list of how to beat certain LS decks. Your basic strategy is just to get Lando and Vader out early to play Sabacc and duel, respectively, and then play according to the deck you're facing. I know that this is probably not detailed enough for some of you, and I apologize for that, but like I mentioned before, I don't get to go to many tourneys so I can't be more detailed.

Enjoy
