Strategy: '

Ok before I get any more ’fluff’ about this, I recieved several rulings stating all i need to do is reach the Home One db.  That’s what this deck is built upon.  I have yet to see nor hear rulings otherwise.  If your local TD rules otherwise, then take the extra turn, or use the damn speeder, and hit the bridge.

*** Deck Edit - dump blount, and add Order to Engage.  That Card is GOD***
*** I would like to add Aim High, cant think of anything to take out...***

This deck is from the genius of Aaron Kingery, old skool Team Albnay who will find ways to beat any deck with mining droids.  He also has a reputation of makeing a really good deck that either gets erratad by decipher or plays less than 8 charachtrers.  THANX AARON

Anyway the deck starts off slow, but as long as its played correctly can be a nightmare for the opponent as your retrieval will overwhelm them.  Let me start by saying, NO, starting secret plans doesnt touch me.  In fact it allows me to delegate when I should retrieve, keeping me aware throughout the game rather than dropping it when I cant turn back.  So the deck startegy is to pull Dag and the hut for early force.  Drop all your dbs, (hoth is anti ”the beast” b/c that deck is a pain) and begin to set up.  Playing 3 tunnel visions ensures you will get the cards you want at the right time.	By thrid turn you should be activating 12+ force, along with any the oppoent gives you.  It is KEY to get Alderaan and Home One db out so that you dont loose them by accident, b/c then you are screwed.  So from here its a mains and beatdown deck that can handle space and ground.  The deck, as you can tell lives off of OMDO, which was erattad to target the Alderaan system.	So Mikey Ds old dockingbay tansit, cash in didnt work anymore, but we found another way.  Get Home One to Alderaan.  And as long as the Home One DB is out, you are all set.  Pick a Rebel, target Alderaan.  He makes the trip and cha-ching hes on the Home One DB which is on Home One which is At Alderaan.  COllect your force and watch the opponent go nuts.  The big retrieval also allows you to play cards like Weapon Lev lost, Controls, and Tunnel visions multiple times each game due to the retrieval factor.	Now for the flaws, there may be some, but this deck can handle Hunt Down, (yet to loose a duel), BHBM, Skum, I outlast big blue space Kippel Style, Hone one is a wrecking machine and people dont realize it, and the Prodigy b/c sac hurts it, along with Aim High (still trying to add).

Now.  Why do I play Rogue 1?  Its a bad card, I know.  Well in the last game of the Civil War when Dan Sokol, PILED every dark charchter in the Home 1 docking bay, it made retriving, hmmm IMPOSSIBLE.  This way the rebel can transit in the ship, then walk to the bridge (safe from the DS) and make the retrieval run.  Also, having an enclosed vehicle if the opponents starts sandwhirling or Ice storming isnt bad ( i know its a reach, but you NEVER know...)

Now for the matchups

BHBM pull jedi luke to the Home 1 db and activate force like a champ.	Set up and track your destinies to force the oppoentn into battling you at the right time.  Use Jedi Presence (right little twigg ;-) to surprise them and bury them in force loss.  Their obj will catch up with them, and even secret plans cant hold this beat down squad from retrieving alot.  You SAC will also seem, endless with Wise and the retrieval.

Hunt Down avoid early dueling until you have your cardz.  Use the visions to get them, and then stcak destinies, and then shove your mains right at him.  Ordet to enguage will make them battle alot and you should play your cards right, a timely fallen portal can be devastating.  All in all you will outlast the oppoentn in this game.

Skum  Sac hurts them as well as your retrieval.  Hook the gkk, Sense the projected telepathy, and you will be all set.  There is no try doesnt hurt, since you WILL get your cards back.

Prodigy Jump on the Deathstar sites and drain.  Hook the All sections on alert and sac everything you can.

Big blue Space Claw their biggest drains until you are set up.  SAC they goofy stuff like barriers and Commands and OVERWHELMED.  You can use the super falcon or the Beefed up Home One to do alot of damage.  Retrieve and tackle them on the ground.


The deck is solid, and it wins.  What else do you want from a lightside deck???
