Cards explanation


I am your father  destiny 6 and if the other guy pull out a luke with stick or a master luke... and your LV

grabs him, the LS is just about done for... you win against luke ONCE he lose 3 force, luke power = 0, therefore

he cannot win any duel afterward (and you can’t deplete the lifeforce, but who care if you know you can’t stack

enought card anyway), so he’ll lose 5 forces per turn just with that.


Emperor’s Prize / All too easy / sniper & Dark strike / Carbonite Chamber well if you have those, 

just before going back to DSII TR, make a lil stop to CCCC and freeze luke with sniper/all too easy.

can be devastating ^.^


most of the rest is biker stuff... lot of surprises that can caught your opponent off hand and make you

win little battles easy to stack cards.


Comments


I know I should have more vaders, but I think 3 is enought, anyway you can search your reserve deck every turn,

janus can download the top card, so just a lil tracking is needed to get a vader.


heh, I would have liked to include a  Vader Obsession, Imperial Decree (against EBO) and a Secret plans

but no more room, maybe if I find something better and as fast as speeder bike, I’ll add them... but I think that Biker Scouts on DBs are total mobility and can retaliate about much decks such as (I never played against a Hidden base deck so I can’t realy say I can do something about it.)


EBO go spread fast and occupy these 5 hoth site, it’s easy with a landspeed of 5, it takes a minimum of 2 turns and the whole hoth ground is covered.


WYS it’s easy the tatoiine DB is already out, just go beat those smugglers on tatoiine but beware of Chewie Protector, Fallen Portal and such, use your guns to snipe out these low DV smugglers.


Profit same thing here, just cover tatoiine grounds, having barich, misik, high speed tactics and such can wreak your opponent havock...just fear lando with vibro ax.


Mind What you have learned you could as well shuttle down your bikers on dagobah with bossk in bus while Vader and the other guys look for luke elsewhere. '
