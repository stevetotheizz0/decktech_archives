Strategy: '

	Goo Nee Tay is the best start against Hunt Down,
but against Ralltir Ops go with Echo Base Garrison.  It makes the unique T-47s (Rogue 1-4) immune to attrition <6 when their matching pilots are aboard, and gives you considerable help putting these guys on the right speeders.
  It also lets you go get Bacta Tank or Lone Rogue.  If you start with Echo Base Garrison, you can get a unique pilot/speeder combination set up quick.  T-47 Battle Formation would be a waste in here.  Not that kind of deck.
  Once you do, they absolutely rock.  With Yoda at his Hut taking 2 off the attrition against you, these things basically become immune to attrition <8  To make things even more disgusting, there is an extra bit of walker-killing tech in here.
  Power Harpoon deploys and fires pretty cheap.  Draw destiny, add maneuver.  If the total if 9 or greater, the walker crashes, taking it right out of the battle.  Since most of the matching pilots add to the maneuver of their speeders, this combined with the high destiny average makes it almost a guarantee.  Not card intensive at all, and trips walkers reliably, taking them out of the battle unlike the weaker Dual Laser Cannons.
  Put Dack or 'Lock' or Wes on board to inch the total a little closer, or just track destiny.  There are a lot of high-destiny cards in here.  To really force the issue, go get Commander Wedge Antilles with Echo Base Garrison and use his game text to grab One More Pass.  Adds the pilot's ability to the Power Harpoon total.
  Basically, if you want to kill a walker, it is yours.  Served up with some fava beans and a nice chianti.  SLUUUUUURP  This gives Ralltir Ops a real hard time.  And pretty much all decks have reason to fear the Luke/Han combination on Rogue 1.	It's the SuperFalcon on land	Two flips, 4 with Don't Get Cocky, and virtually impervious to attrition.
  A good space complement rounds out the deck, along with a lot of defensive effects and interrupts, which get SAC protection from the objective game text and Wise Advice.
  Oh, and if your opponent is playing Set Your Course For Alderaan, the best strategy is to invade the Death Star big-time.  With Boushh undercover somewhere, her game text keeps Come Here You Big Coward from canceling the force drains (read both cards), so your mains can run amok.
  Enjoy, and don't blame me when people start to hate playing against you.  (g)     '
