ok, so i know the deck doesnt look like much, but if u arent an idiot then u will be fine.  first off though, dont rate me based on my grammar or spelling or some bs like that. next, i forgot no escape when i posted this and i am too lazy to go change it, so sec precautions should prolly be no escape(typically the 3rd starting effect), but no one really plays heavy space based HB here anymore, but if its big where u are then take somethin else out.  then i also forgot 2 more highly important cards in YCHF and search and destroy and bad feeling have i, these should go in for any of the meta effects that arent big in your area, i would go with them over a makurth and a barrier and maybe bubo probably, but do what u think is best in your area.  i also know that i forgot some stuff in this since i dont have my deck in front of me and i am doin this from memory, so ill fix it later.  even though i only use 4 sites over starting and they are all 1/1 d-bays dont overlook that as being the true power of the deck.  if u are smart then u will give your opponent no more than a max of 6 force off of your sites during the entire game while u can easily generate a solid 12+ off of just your own sites inside of the first 4 turns.  ok, now u would say, ”what about only doin a max of 6 damage from your own sites”?  i say, u get at least 1 direct damage per turn from obj if u keep xizor goin, plus drains, plus vigo bonuses, plus emp damage for obj, plus search and destroy, plus presence, all in all u can be doin around 10 damage in between yer turn and opponents, and the upside being that u only need to control 3 sites to accomplish all this.  now u say, ”what about beatdown decks and weak protection for xizor”?  is my protection so weak, i dont think so, i may not look like much but i can do a lot in a turn.  now then, let me go through the first couple turns for ya.  first turn, i activate, go get <> d-bay from deck or deploy from hand (only had it in force pile once, and it didnt matter), now i move xizor over to the bay to flip, put a card on the bottom of your used and look through yer force pile, find go characters/ints/effects grab em ( particularly u are lookin for bad feeling have i, barriers, guri, vigos, makurths, and another xizor, more or less in that order, barrier and 1 force left back should be all important)if its @#$% leave it and wait a turn not a big deal, now u are done, there go.  they usually leave poor defenseless(hehe) xizor all alone and try to set up on there own play style for obj etc, especially since they only get their starting force +1 and that not much of a beatdown against a 5 power +destiny ground tank who has high immunity and denies them a destiny, most people thinks its better to stay away, they normally deploy some guys and start to set up and/or draw, back to u.  heres where u have to start pickin yer spots, thats the only real power of the deck.  look for bad feeling and get it quick from obj/twi leks and get it down, u are now playing defensive to loll yer opponent into leaving u an opening or feebily trying to come to u. ok, so now yer 2nd turn, u typically get 7+ what they give u in generation, now u hit them for 1 off the obj and 1 to drain, drop a card from habd to see whats in force and start lookin for helpful cards in the match-up this should become a priority, now pull a second d-bay and drop emp at coruscant + move xizor if u got an emp, otherwise xizor chills and u deploy a vigo and/or some monkey to another d-bay,now then u draw down to where u wanted from what u saw before u need to be looking for twi lek, vigos, and presences along with the 1st turn tech now.  then it goes to them, they keep settin up since they only have 2+ their own sites for activation most still consider it an unwise move to come after me this soon(their mistake), they drain and deploy then draw and are done.  back to u, u keep lookin for cards with obj if its stil flipped(every turn that its flipped u cycle cards, its tech), now keep lookin for drain modifiers and pull another site and weakly deploy to it, u should be doin 3-4 cards damage at the lowest end if no battles came up yet, they will be forced to do somethin about this now as u deprive them of force and can easily now generate 12+ force independently thus making them fear the beatdown as u havent deployed heavy yet(u should have bad feelong, barriers, and solid characters by now, dont spend them to deploy too heavy, just sit back a couple extra turns if its necessary to build a solid hand, but try to keep the size low), now u start the mental half of these games, always look through your force and always seem dissapointed when u do regardless of what is or isnt in there, keep your hand size as low as possible and ask constant question but avoid ones that will cause them to potentially see flaws in their own set up, look for weak points and start to try and avoid battles that will cause u to tip your hand or show your true prowess in battle from hunters w/ guns, obj bonuses in attrtions, and sheer force of beatdown due to the severe lospidedness in activation, now play on your heels and try to look like even u dont understand what u are doin, do your steady damage and force them too come too u or spread to keep up, now u give them the table and wait to strike.  they should continue to set themselves up as u will have slowed tjem, down by only giving them 3-4 force and by doing damage to force them to conserve cards, now is when most people think that u are weak and will try to finish u quickly before their chance for a huge victory goes away,normal skill level of players or even better ones who think u are weak will normally in there first few turns try to toss out luke or take down xizor to avooid the advantage your obj gives u in damage races, barriers are power here as u can back up your fighting force and they will have a much more difficult time of it plus your obj makes them lose more people and your d-bays have high costs to move to or from (especially endor/ds, ouch), now then as they begin to spread out or try to take u out now is when your massive activation of somewhere near 15-20 after the first 5 or less turns lets u deal massive damage off of a single battle and thgis is where the few ints and characters get to show what they can really do, 4-LOM and wounded wookies say that your opponents EPs dont do anything so why fear em, IG gives another destiny and caps weak people for attrition or power, dengar shoots twice and trackin is easy with card cycling ability so get rid of those pesky mains, snoova is big and cheap, guri stops destines from piling up, and makurths can be a steady 5 force for 3, while they vigos give 3 power and soak up decent attrition with guri around, for around 25 or a little more (which seems like a lot but is really only 1 or maybe 2 turns max of ativation) u can have upwards of 30 or more power while u deny the opponent extra destiny, pick off their characters with hunters, cancel text and immunity multiple ways, and u have massive attrion if u can keep the obj flipped.  what i am sayin here is normally if u set up well and play well then u can have a steady amount of damage each turn while choosing a place to deal massive amounts of battle damage and character losses in a single battle as well.  if your opponent tries to keep up with your previously described 10+ damage per turn once set up they will have to spread or try a beatdown (eithe rof which = a solid chance at a swift victory for u) or they will have to respect the beatdown pssibility and try to conserve power and sites(both of which can be gotten around with smart plays) in which case u can deal more damage as well as have much less commitment to cards on table allowing more fodder losses for u and much less for them.  anyway, i talk to much and i dont know that anyone understood that crap or will play/alter the deck correctly anyway so wtf do i even bother, o ya and for all u monkey s who will make assanine remarks about this deck design it was made for correlia, not wherever u are so if it is missing meta for your area and has something u think is useless the tailor it to your needs and dont @#$% at me for it, also i forgot grabbers which are a viable addition for some of the afore mentioned worthless meta.  thats it, im done here

PS
