Strategy: '

As I finally got Mara I decided to sit down and make an effective dueling deck. I looked around the net and found docking bays and Gabe's deck looked good. So I made each and melded them into one deck, hopefully that still works well. Now I know this has been done before and all but still, don't review based on that. Review based on the deck and the cards used. Thanks.

Deck by deck--------

Mains Advantage me. I can battle and duel efficiently with this deck. IG88 is a menace. He wrecks them. Use visage when you can. You should win convincingly.

Inserts Get set up, use torture when possible. Duel hitnrun EPPs. Battle others. Drain when you can. Take inserts if you have too.

Hiddenbase set up drains. Get search and destroy goin. Send ships up late to probe. Duel. Duel. Counter Assualt too.

I think this deck is 'gas'. Thanks.
