Strategy: '

This deck flat-out kicks butt.  You can pull 14 characters out with Strike Planning and Madine.  3 of those characters have matching starships.  Thats a good space fleet so far.  Out Of Nowhere is perfect.  It shouldnt be too hard to draw one site after pulling the docking bay with Insurrection.  Then you flip.  Start retrieving scouts.  Heres the general strategy

vs. Hunt Down	Luke should be hard to cross, but even so, keep him with General Solo to work as a LS Tarkin.  Use Honor Of A Jedi to fight visage.  If youre feeling daring, you can send a Tala pilot to the Executor.  Shouldnt be too hard

vs. ISB HA this deck eats ISB for breakfast	Put the Tala pilots in their ships to boost the spys deploy costs and make them lose force.  They cant affect your drain when youre flipped and it shouldnt be too hard to do that.  For fun, put out Menace Fades.

vs. BHBM Use Luke to win battles, then lose him.  Soak up the damage with Honor.  Beat up the Emperor.  Fairly easy win.

vs. Court watch out for the BH ships.	They can hurt.	Soak up the Objectives damage with Honor.  Drain them to tiny pieces

vs. ROps rarely seen it played in my area.

Heres the cards
-Major Panno adds to your activation and is vital to this deck.
-Corporal Midge adds to your drains at cerain sites.
-Ithorians boost your activation/drains
-Obi-Wan is a general
-Ackbar can pull AOs
-Close Air Support RULES in this deck.
-So does Insertion Planning and Take The Iniative
-Taking Them With Us lowers most scouts deploy cost, defense value, and forfiet
-Capital Support is an awesome way of direct damage with 4 generals in this deck.

Well, thats it for now.  Please be constructive.  Thank you
