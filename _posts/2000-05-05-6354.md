Wise Advice '

Strategy: '

Oops. Forgot to add Tibrin (battle ground for battle plan, plus grabs #s back). I'd dump a signal, but thats because this area has so much HuntDown. If that is not popular in your area, dump a trans. term.

BTW no one plays resistance (at least in this area), and when I have faced resistance, I won anyway. Mains occupy BGs all the time, and to the idiot who thought I couldn't occupy a BG unless I get my Tibrin I start w/ a BG. Move a Nudj from his site, stick Tawss Khaa down, #s total is still 13, and I occupy a BGfor resistance.

This deck is SOLID. It covers all fronts, and is teched out to kick ass

I got a lot of feedback on my last version of this deck, so I modified it to include the feedback. It was pretty unanamous that I needed some grabbers, and a few said add more ships. I also added demotion (stick on Navy Trooper Vesden...booyah)

Fairly easy to use. Get #s and AFAs running, throw down an epp, battle free, retrieve 1, they lose 1, hit 1 of their guys, take out another w/ attrition, lose EPP to tank (to keep #s total up). Rinse and repeat. All the Comments I got on the last version were implemented, so you all should like this version.
