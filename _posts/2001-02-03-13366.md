Strategy: 

This deck will never lose force

first deploy electros on a charactor which is in the trash compactor.

deploy light sabers on all the charactors 

use electros to get a its a hit in hand and it could be worse

it could be worse makes the you lose no force

It’s a hit cancels ITs worse

Force drain at alot at the trash compactor and lose no force.

I Know this isnt a long strategy but it works.
