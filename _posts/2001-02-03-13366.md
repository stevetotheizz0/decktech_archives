Strategy: '

This deck will never lose force


first deploy electros on a charactor which is in the trash compactor.


deploy light sabers on all the charactors 


use electros to get a its a hit in hand and it could be worse


it could be worse makes the you lose no force


It’s a hit cancels ITs worse


Force drain at alot at the trash compactor and lose no force.


I Know this isnt a long strategy but it works.
