against any kind of space decks

Old school Luke
Against BHBM deploy him to H1 DB in your first turn. Also useful for his ship.


Why only three ships?
Go to space if you can beat him down with Superfalcon and/or Monster Dash.

Why no SAC protection?
I did not see SAC for a long time


Matchups
Against space decks
Start Obi`s Hut with Insurrection, St. Areas and YISYW. Search for I hope she`s ok.
Try to drain him and retrieve. Go to space when he does not expect this. Landing Claw will be helpful.

Against Scum
Start with Obi`s Hut and the palace, but only if you can convert his JP.
Play like a Mains and toys.

Against Dark Side Mains and Toys
Start Obi`s Hut and Ins., SAreas and YISYW.
Play smart, retrieve, track your destinies and try avoid battle unless you want to battle.
