Strategy: 

vs. Ops - Get A Bright Center out.  Start drains in space and beat down.  Let Visage do its fair share... if it gets cancelled with a Spy to the Holotheatre, grab Come Here You Big Coward.  Walkers kill off Operatives fairly easily.

vs. HB - Drain on the ground and search for ships... then when they flip deploy like 3-4 ships and probe.  Then late game is when you bring the pain.  Drain at their systems and on the ground with sabers and so forth... I'm usually draining for 6 plus late game.

vs. Profit - Profit sucks, you should win.  Drain in space, beat on the ground.

vs. MWYH

Well hey I gotta go Ill finisht he strategy when I get back
