Strategy: '

Start by pulling all 3 docking bays. With Staging Areas you can get 13 force by turn 3. Also get Han out as fast as you can by overpowering your opponent or Boushh and Someone Who Loves You. A lot of people don&#8217;t deploy to the AC so try to make a strong 1st or 2nd turn flip. Once he is out move him to Tatooine Jabba&#8217;s Palace and Bo Shuda the Audience Chamber. Use the cards to keep Han alive and keep him in the Docking Bays on Tatooine so you can use the Fallen Portals. I don&#8217;t have Ben Kenobi in here because I don&#8217;t have him. He also doesn&#8217;t protect Han from capturing. Instead I put a lot of Narrow Escapes in and a couple of Fallen Portals. Deploy Tessek to the Audience Chamber. You use the YWTMTJN cards on him first. Now you can use the Eloms and B&#8217;omarr Monks to add to your force drains. Make sure you put and Elom at Home One Docking Bay for an easy drain. Make sure your starships are deployed to places where they can stop Decree. This is very important I dont have any On The Edges in because my destinys arent very high and they arent really worth it. If your opponent tries to get in a drain war with you or doesnt go near you just out drain him with all the drain bonus. If your playing Court start Aim High instead of Uh-Oh. Also try not to get dueled.
