Strategy: '

Cards That I'm Adding and taking Out
  Put In (4)  CrackShot, Slayn Korpil Facilities,
	       proton Torpedoes,Blue Squadron Bwing

  Take out(4) L. blount, Tala 2, C. Cracken, Tala 1

Due To popular Demand I put JT#6 Back in1
Put in Proton torpedos too...

Crackshot is EXCELLANT Addition to this deck because you'll hit everything you encounter in space, And Then they'll lose more...

Blue Squadron B-wings are better for this deeck because of their Bonus when Firing Weapons. So I took out Tala 1 & 2 and their Pilots.

Slayn Korpil Facilities - Just an extra card Since I have Roche anyway, Could be good for retrieval earlyin thegame.

Technique/Strategy
------------------
Against Bring Him Before Me or Hunt Down and Destroy The Jedi on Turn 1
 send Yor Insight Serves you well to the lost pile to retrieve
 Honor Of The Jedi


For Jedi Test #5 Try To Track a 7....Against BHBM your should try to track
 R2 in Red 5 so that when You defeat Vader in a BHBM duel, Luke will not
 cross to the DS.

At Peace is in here For Protection Against Broken Concentration.

Once The Training Grounds is out, Search for a Jedi Test During EVERY TURN,
  This includes Your Opponents Kepp all Jedi tests in Hand at All Times.

Intruder Missles arent just here for Destiny Tracking, They can deploy on
  EVERY Starfighter in the deck except R2 in Red 5 and Red Squadron 1.

Super Falcon = 5 destinies after completing Jedi Test #6
  Han, Lando, Liea, Nien Nunb

Sense Alter Protection	- I know it will be hard at first with the +4 and
the high Destiny Deck, But After you flip, which doesn't take long, You
should be able to keep your opponent from playing any devstating effects,
or intterupts.

Retrieval, against Something Special Planned for them, Being able to retriev 18 cards should be good enough...Having that card placed out of play shouldnthurt you too bad.

ROCHE - Its a Battle Ground system where your opponent cant drain you, but youcan drain him.   '
