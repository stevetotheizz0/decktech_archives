Strat
this deck was made for fun and for side games at tournaments and to play with friends, butdont automaticly rule it out as bad.  the element of suprise with stunning leader and you overestimate...... is good plues they get 2 force from u.  i only play 1 battleground because i intend to fight on their turf.  i usually dont deploy vader until luke is out just cause i dont want to get him beat up.  also if they put luke out first and isnt much defended i can beat him for an early card on IR.  keep in mind 3 of my scrubs r leader so they are out of the battle with stunning leader.  and for u who say sack is gone cause of WYS ur wrong cause u go swarm their tat sites and can prob keep them out of space with 2 dest(1 with emps power).  they over all dest of this deck isnt too bad cause theres tons of 4(drednaughts r 4 with opressive enforcement) and lots of 2/3â€™s.  make sure that your at an interior site with stunning leader.  and my question is can u do it at interrior/exterrior docking bays, like the ones that r both.  im almost posative u can i just dont want to be missing some big glaring rule.  this deck is pretty self explanatory so i dont think it needs a matchups.  i dont take this to tournys, i take isb scum, but this is still a cgood competative deck that is extremely fun to play.  hope u like it, ciao.
