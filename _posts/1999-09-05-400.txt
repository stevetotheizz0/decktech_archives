Strategy: 

guard rendili with exacutor and a couple VCSD (at lease have a couple VCSD at rendili before deploying rendili stardrive) firepower helps keep weponds on table, rendili helps recycle VCSD, twe'lek adviser helps get all effects and icant shake him and heavy fire zone are great for weponds high destiny and gets weponds on table, resistance helps against dagobah decks and echo base decks by cutting back on force drains and insert cards, use monnok to keep your opponent 'honest'(so he doesnt deploy 7 corrilian corvettes at a time)
