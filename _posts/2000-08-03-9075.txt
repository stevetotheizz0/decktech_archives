Strategy: 

To start, play Prepared Defenses to deploy Imperial Arrest Order, Crush The Rebellion, and Mobilization Points at the start of the game.  On your first turn, deploy the Death Star II: Docking Bay from your Reserve Deck with Arrest Order, and deploy the Emperor there for a quick 7 Force activation on your second turn.  You can also take The Emperor's Power and an I Have You Now from your Reserve Deck.  Continue to deploy your docking bays with Imperial Arrest Order so that your characters can easily move to any planet on which your opponent intends to drain.
Deploy Vader, Mara, (preferrably with lightsabers) and your walkers to control three battleground sites to get by Honor Of The Jedi.  With the direct damage from Your Destiny and Search And Destroy, you can put serious pressure on the opponent.  Jabba and his bounty hunters in this deck are extremely important, adding battle destinies in space and on the ground.  The downloadable Executor and Lateral Damage are awesome for quick victories in space.  The general strategy is to win as many battles as possible and eliminate as many of the opponent's cards from the table as possible.  The flip side of the objective is merely a bonus.
