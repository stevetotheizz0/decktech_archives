Strategy: '

Ok, this is like a WYS BEAT . And people are not ready for it. And there is no walker admit on cloud city, and you don’T give the cantina to your oponent .... And there is much more destiny adder to make the deadly kill. + there is path of least resistance witch is huge to increase your power. And pretty good for defensive card. And you f*cking activate 

You play that deck much like you play the falke deck. And you start with battle plan, so you dont get drain to death in 3 turn. And you battle for free.

I should have played that deck at my proviencial, but I had played so much palace raider, that I decided to stick with them. but that deck will be even stronger after the release of the new Tat cards. So I will start practicing

If you donT know what I mean when I say you play this he same way you play the falke deck its simple.

You start the game ,if the guy is playing space, go to ground to drain a little. Else, go in space. Get your beatdown crew ready. 

If the oponent decide not to come on CC, you drain him for 4, retrieve 3, and YOU donT pay for battle plan. So he will loose if he dont come. When he comes beat him down with the triple card and huge power. With celebration, battle plan, and menace fade, he will come ;)

Well, I donT have more time for strategy, play the deck and you will see
