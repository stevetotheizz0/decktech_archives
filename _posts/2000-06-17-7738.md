Dantooine Ops'

Strategy: '

Deploy the swamp first, then a nudj. make sure there's a nudj at each site. use the sic sic, hemnthe, and Goo Nee Tay to make it expensive 4 the opponent 2 get 2 dantooine. if they do, u've got plenty of mains. use the rebel recruits 2 save ur epps from attrition. then use the squadrons 2 drain in space and fight them on the ground 2. add s foils 2. the theyre on dantooine is 2 slow down the new death star decks. use boush 2 cancel visage of the emporer if they're using hunt down. it usually works, but isb is tough 2 beat w/ this.'
