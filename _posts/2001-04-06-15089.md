Strategy: '

This is a basic EBO deck that uses Strike Planning to pull out your ground forces and to make EBO work faster.  I have 5 The Signals in here, I think that’s plenty enough to get one in your opening hand to get ANSB going.  Anyways, pull out General Solo and Crix, or if you have 1 of those in your hand, pull Calrissian.  Use The Signal to get out ANSB and deploy it.  Deploy Echo Command Center and Docking Bay from reserve with ANSB.  Next turn, get the other Echo site and Echo Base ops in your hand.  Deploy Crix to an Echo site, then pull out Cracken/Blount from Reserve and deploy them to another.  If you have enough force, deploy another character to the other and deploy EBO.  Next turn, pull out Hoth and deploy whatever ships you have there.  Next turn, deploy another planet.  Deploy ships, then next turn, do the same, etc.  Make sure you get Hol Okand to Kashyyyk and Lepira to Anoat for the extra 1 to the drains.  You’ll get goin fast, and only a dedicated space fleet will take out your ships.  Use OOC/TT to get rid of pesky Visage and whatever else.  Deploy General Solo and COK to a location where opponent is the weakest or doesn’t expect you have to have any kind of ground forces.  Make sure you leave about 4 force to cancel his battle destiny this turn and next.  Keep more force if you’re afraid he’ll do some kind of tomfoolery on you.  Have fun. '
