Strategy: '

Deploy ur speeder bikes and Tempest 1 to defend ur people on the ground, then grab ESB first, then OR because you donâ€™t wanta spread out too thin.drain in space and ground to kill them. you should get huge drains with esb and or.  Use COmbat response to pull ur ties. drain in space and ground to kill them. you should get huge drains with esb and or. use power of the hutt to grab ephant mon on ur first turn, to solidify perimeter patrol. use mob points to get the extra activation. make good use of secret plans and search and destroy i cant shake him and watch ur back. use ychf and twilek advisor to get out per. patrol.

matchups

Swarms- Match them up. Force drain on the ground or go after them on the ground because most swarms (except maybe hidden base) have some kinda small ground help.

Profit-Go after them on and kill Han asap to flip the objective back. Your space drains will hurt them bad I believe

Agents- Your drains will be matched up by their drains. It will be close. You can put your characters on the ground her and there if they don&#8217;t think you have any. Save them up for a massive beatdown. Your space drains will go untouched usually.


TIGIH- Get Vader to Luke and hold him steady. Don&#8217;t lose battles. I know it is easier said than done, but your main objective in this deck is to overpower and then force drain. If you lose, you may lose the game. Beat them down
