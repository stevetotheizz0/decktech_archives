Cards


Turns  Pull Crix and/or Solo, Pull COK, pull Wuta, pull a site. 2nd turn, pull Midge, get a ship out. 3rd turn, pull Brooks Carlson, and by now you should have out Gen. Solo. 4th turn, get out another scout, flip. 

5th turn, drain for about 5-6. Retrieve a scout. 

7th turn through the rest of the game just drain and retrieve. I usually win by 10, 15, 20, or higher. 


I don’t blow up the Generator because it is too card extensive, but it can help. I use to blow it up and on one turn, I blew it up they lost 8, and then I drained for 12. 20 force, boom. 


I was thinking about putting in Admiral Ackbar to get out my AO faster, so please let me know if I should in the review. 


Otherwise, this deck is pretty basic. 


Vs BHBM You win, drain and kick @$$. Give them Luke, and drain. They get a beatdown next turn from my scouts. 


Vs Court Go to space and drain on the ground. Usually, they have no ships or weak ones, so just attrition them away. Control Tatooine if you see Tatooine Occupation coming. 


Vs MKOS Same as court 


Vs HD Tough. I have only played one, and only won by 4. Cancel Visage, don’t deploy Blount or Cracken because of Put all Sections on Alert  Then they drop a beatdown squad.  If that happens play It’s a Trap and that will save you, hopefully.  If you deploy Luke, watch out for Dueling.  Just drain.


Any other deck, just drain and retrieve.
