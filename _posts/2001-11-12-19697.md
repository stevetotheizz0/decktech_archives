Strategy: '

early get out sites. flip as soon as you can, since it cant flip back. establish a ground force and drain.


mid game get out cc celebration and retrieve and drain. keep a hold on bespin and cc.


late game use on the edge to replenish force. drain to win.


card choice  

Awing cannon green leader adds 3 to targeting, plus destiny 4


on the edge you can use off the edge if you want, doesn’t matter.


2 chewies i know there are 2, if you get both, just stop paying for one so you can play the other.


cloud city casino if you play the casino, people may think you are sabaccing.  they might waste a sheild. if not, its 2 force for you and 1 for them, and you can land ships here if nessecary.


match ups


dark deal stop the opponent from getting it out. if he plays occupation, control bespin and cancel it.


rall ops ignore opponent, you’ll probably drain for more, and you’ll definetly retreive more.


carbon chanmber chop the ugnaughts. get a ground force to stop the transport of the frozen guy. if they actualy freeze him, use it could be worse to block the damage.


any space deck use dash/outrider to knock down executer, wedge and tycho or corran to block a destiny, and xwing lasers to waste bounty hunter ships, and use i’ll take the leader to mess up bounty hunter ships.


deck won 2 of 3 games it played at a local tournament, losing to a lightsaber combat objective by 2 force. '
