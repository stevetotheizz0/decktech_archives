Strategy: 

Well, this strategy section might be a little short, but that's cuz the deck is self-explanatory. ALWAYS start Tatooine and Combat Readiness for the Palace. You'll convert everything that Profit has, and you get good activation, you pull an alien, and you don't need to draw Tatooine to set up Occupation. Fighter Cover will help protect your characters since it adds 1 to each of their weapon destinies and 2 to their immunity. You can't take Vader out with a Smoke Screen. Your ships are the best that there are and they can deal with any threat. I have never lost the system in all my games, and I have beaten at least 2 EBOs. Speaking of EBO, the Lateral Damage and the Masterful Move x2 and Monnok x2 will help to take that out. The Super Falcon isn't that scary because of destiny tracking and the Imperial Barriers. Those Barriers will also protect your lone characters at Tatooine sites. You can then beatdown as you see fit in the turns thereafter. Not as much SAC protection because I don't see it much around here. Play with more if you like, it's a meta decision. Oh, and one last thing. Always Thinking With Your Stomach is TECH against the new Light Side objective. That is how you kill that objective with one card. Props to Cody "Legolas" DiCara for discovering that one. That's it for me. If you have any questions, d-mail me. Later.
