Strategy: '

The strategy is very simple, just get your locations out of your deck and  than start draining your opponent with sabers and Gailid. You should have enought power to win on the ground and in space... Well if you’re lucky you might win the game agains space deck.
I won’t write more about strategy becouse like I said this deck is supposed to be fun deck, and winning isn’t the most important. So have fun and thanks for reading. '
