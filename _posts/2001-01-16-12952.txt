Strategy: 

The basic thing you do with this deck is set up ralltiir then start
pulling out cards to battle. and retreve with first strike.


Against the smugglers I play basicly super chimera and play the prince and his hoe in their ships
wich can haddle about anything. their really notihing more to say about execpt to drain at ralltiir and to fight in space or on the ground
