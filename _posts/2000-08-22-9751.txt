Strategy: '

This is the revision of my Raltiir deck posted several days ago. I took out Torent and some of the red for Shocking Revelation and Omni Box. I also added in Chimaera, a second Dreadnaught, and Blizzard 2.

I played my old Rops deck around March-May where it only lost 3 games. All its losses were to Derek Halpern (1897). Now that DSII is out, I am remaking it with some new cards. The title is inspired by the Dreamcast game Gundam Wing Sidestory 0079 Rise Up From The Ashes. Here's a revised strategy

Basically you pull a Raltiir site, Executor Docking Bay, and Wakeelmui on your first turn and put some dude at the docking bay. Then you get a minimum of 7 force. Then you keep pulling stuff until you have alot of activation and you flip. Then use the flip side of the objective to pull stuff from your reserve and battle them with +3-4 to your battle destiny. You should be able to kick them off most of their locations plus Overseeing It Personally gives you extra drains and Empire's New Order can provide retrieval (especially against Eloms).

Locations The generic sites and Raltiir are necessary to flip. The Hoth sites are for activation or for setting up Imperial Decree. Wakeelmui and Executor DB are for activation while Kashyyyk is for a battleground system.

Characters Most of the 2/2 guys are decent pilots and can go to Executor DB for Mob Points +2 activation. These guys are also good with Imperial Arrest Order for forfeit fodder. Vader and IG-88 are for battling and the Emperor is for setting up Overseeing It Personally. Janus is for support on Raltiir or maybe battling somewhere. Igar and his walker are good to battle with and the AT-ST pilots are for automatic draws with the AT-ST's.

Ships The bounty hunter ships all have neat effects on the opponent's ships. Dengar is to get rid of Home One, the Falcon, or some ship with immunity as well as swarm decks. Zuckuss makes it so they need 7 ability to draw battle destiny. Fett can hold a system by himself, Bossk is an automatic draw, the Dreadnaughts are for loading pilots up on and battling. The Chimaera can have pilots put on it and battle around in space with it and it has immunity.

Vehicles The AT-ST's are for reacting around, protecting Raltiir and Tempest 1 is for Igar. Blizzard 2 and a 2/2 pilot can hold down a site hopefully.

Interrupts Ghhhk is for your guys at the docking bays or if they just beat you down with like 10 Eloms. Prepared Defenses is your starting interrupt. Barrier is to protect from beatdown and Shut Him Up or Shut Him Down is to cancel Bacta Tank or Death Star Plans. Shocking and Ommni Box are recycling 5's. Use them to track. Ommni Box against people who are tracking and use Shocking if they use Oola.

Effects IAO is to help you pull docking bays, help out your 2/2 guys, and to prevent Nabrun beatdowns. Mob Points is to pull Wakeelmui and to give you extra activation at docking bays. Secret Plans, Come Here You Big Coward, Battle Order, and Imperial Decree help stop drains or retrieval. Oppressive Enforcement so your grabbers get out free and for S/A. S&D helps punish non-interactive decks or to close up a game while Empire's New Order helps you retrieve when your opponent uses aliens (especially Eloms, Operatives, and Ewoks). Overseeing It Personally gives you a nice drain of 2 at each Raltiir site if Emperor is at a Raltiir site you control. Grabbers are for abusive interrupts. Security Precautions is to help against Hidden Base or to give you some activation. Reactor Terminal puts cards back in your reserve deck and let's you track. Lateral Damage is to hurt space decks like EBO or HB.

Now this is customized to my local meta. If you want to include SAC just pull out some junk and you can add another grabber or add odds protection or anything you want. I think a Trample or two would be nice in here and maybe an Overload. Here's some strategy

Vs. Profit
Should be pretty easy. Use IG-88 to capture Han back use your massive battle destinies, drain on Raltiir and in space. Use walkers to keep your guys from getting Fallen Portalled.

Vs. Mains
Pretty hard. They get lots of activation and can beat you down. Try to set up fast with lots of activation. React around to prevent beatdown.

Vs. Eloms
Hard matchup I think. Use Empire's New Order to retrieve when they lose Eloms. Set up fast and in space. Reacting is big here as well as huge destinies.

Vs. There Is Good In Him
Flip fast, drain, use massive battle destinies and Lateral Damage and your bounty hunters ships. Might want to grab Luke to like Executor docking bay or something like that.

Vs. Endor/Farm
Same as above really. Use Lateral Damage, BH ships, massive battle destinies and kill him with drains on the ground.

Vs. Hidden Base
Don't deploy until after he flips and then probe all the systems. Search and Destroy will hurt him. If he goes to the ground beat him down. Early ground drains will hurt him.

Vs. EBO
Try to set up and flip. Get Decree out and drain him on the ground. S&D might help and if he comes out beat his guys down. Use space fleet and Lateral damage. Pile up pilots on the Dreadnaughts and the Chimaera.

Vs. Anything else
Just flip and get the deck going. Battle him where he is and if he comes to you react and kill him.

I tried to cover most of everything. Your suggestion are welcome.
