Strategy: 

Forgot the objective, Hunt Down and Destroy the jedi. Take out Lt. Pol Treidum.


Drop down your characters, drain away, Ghhk any excessive battle damage. Use Tarkin and Vader to take out mains. With Visage and draining this deck kills the opponet quickly and efficiently. Use IAO to pull out the rebel base sites, then get Decree started quickly if needed.

VS. Hidden Base, Use BH ships to probe and drain. Drain away at the sites. Stop any retrieval with Secret Plans and Imbalance.

VS. RTP, try to get Vader down and kill Leia quickly. Then simply drop and drain. They won't be able to do enough damage to kil you before you kill them.

VS. Mains and toys,  Start draining and get out Bad Feeling ASAP, kill off Obi and Luke with Vader and Mara, you should be able to drain/visage them to death.

VS. EBO, Get out decree ASAP and just hold on to the rebel base sites. Invade hoth, mess around with the bounty hunter ships. If you keep decree going you will win the drain race.

Vs. Profit, Start Mara and Jabba. Drain them ASAP. Fight there mains on Tatooine, drop lone characters elsewhere.
