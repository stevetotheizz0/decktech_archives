'

Strategy: '

This is a Hunt Down deck that I´m thinking in playing in the next tournament. I´m now playing a SYCFA, but I would like to change a bit. Please tell me what do you think about it.


Starting the starting locations and visage are clear so as starting interrupt I would play Prepared Def. and as starting effects Secret Plans, YCHF and IAO.


In my second turn I should have deployed Vader and 2 docking bays (normaly Executor and either CC or Endor (to stop QMC or RST).

From here to the end you must try to duel Luke or Obi-wan and thanks to the high destinys there are in this decks, quite surelly win them.


Match-ups


Vs HB hard game as they wont deploy easely to ground, but you can confront them with your solid space. Search and Destroy will hurt it a lot.

Vs QMC really easy game.

Vs HB Mains look for Luke and Ben and duel them both.

Vs RST same as above.

Vs RTP It´s not very popular in my area, but I don´t think is a hard game, try to keep YCHF on table as many of them play numbers.

Vs WYS really hard game. Is on of the most solid decks I´ve ever saw. Play smart and carefully. Go to Tatooine and try to control it´s sites.


I hope everything is quite clear. If there is something not enoght explained please d-mail me.

Thanks for reading and rating it. '
