Strategy: '

Yes, thats right, I attemted the impossible and built a flagship opps deck. I think this deck is  more fun then it is good. 
first start off by pulling wakeelmui, and the executer DB. start up by putting a presence at the meditation chamber and puting vader there and flip, though its not necessary. get a twilek to pull sienar, and start the retrieval in space. if you get the executer sights out set up FO and your destiny 5 bombers will now be deploy -1 and destiny 7, don’t worry the executer won’t die, seeing its immune to alll attrition. get mirrajik and pull the systems, and drain and retrieve. use the meditation chambers gametext so you can get destiny every where in space, also make all thiev destinies -2.
this deck is fun as hell to play, but a little weak. i’m still having trouble getting the other 2 executer sites out. 
go ahead try the deck out and have a blast with your friends. 
if you have any good suggestions d-mail me.
thanks for your time. '
