Objective:
Raltiir opperations/ In The Hands Of The Empire



Strategy: 

This my version of my friend Martin Akesson's Raltiir-deck. When I saw him playing it, I decided it needed some changes. I added: Bad Feeling have I, Another AT-ST Pilot(5) and Torture x2.
I removed some Alter's and Evader's.
Now, just make sure you get a fast control on the ground of Raltiir and keep it that way thruogh your reacting AT-ST's. If you have Bad Feeling Have I, opponents most dangerous characters will cost +4 to deploy. This is a great advantage in your quest to keep the control on the ground. When the time is right, use your high destiny's to wipe out your opponent. This shouldn't be too hard, considering you can search your reservedeck for the cards you want with your flipped objective. Navy Trooper Vesden and the pair of Torture's will provide the extra protection aganist odds...
