Strategy: '

Start Scramble if they put down mara and fett, otherwise start do or do not.  rescue han when you have 9 or 10 lost cards. 2 ships and 1 claw just to slow an omnious rumors deck.

vs.hdadtj 2 obis, 3 lukes, 2 leias in a battling deck will keep the objective's '0' side up. also with the obj., i can retrieve the force i lose to visage early on. i have dueling protection.

vs.isb a gift works well if they play 20 ors, also i can spread out on tatooine and make them lose like 10 a turn, and beatdown lone ors.

vs.cotvg i've never played cotvg, but if i did, i'd try to rescue han before they get set up at the chamber. then use mains and stuff to battle them.

vs.cctthey freeze whoever, i lose 8 force, next turn flip the obj, retrieve 10. while they try to get to the chamber, i set up my beatdown crew on tatooine, and spread out the mains so they lose force from the objective.

vs.tdigwatt i may need to go to bespin to fight, but send a few mains there, spread out on tatooine and flip the objective.

vs.raltirr pick and choose your battles. try not to let them flip. if they do, you'll have to get them to flip back.


vs. omnius rumors start w/ battle plan, dont flip till you have 10 lost cards. use the claw to slow them.
vs.cpi rescue han asap, shuttle up/ get all your mains into space, drain at the other systems they put out while they try to blow up tatooine. thats why gold leader is here instead of red leader you can add a guy to gold's ship.

vs. numbers start ultimatium. rescue han after you lose 10 cards. spread out and drain. then win.

vs. ops start battle order. drain, battle, win.
