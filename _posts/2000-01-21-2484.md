Strategy: '

This deck is still in the development stages so any comments would be appreciated.

The idea is to use Captive Pursuit, Corellian Retort, Someone Who Loves You, Sorry About the Mess, Master Luke, and Ambush to release Han as soon as possible.	General Solo will cancel destiny with Chewie or Orimaarko so take care to cancel that destiny and battle battle battle.  Start with Goo Nee Tay against anything that doesn't look like SAC.  Setup Tat Celeb and retrieve when possible.

vs. Ops.- This deck could benefit from a Battle Plan here.  Although this is a meta decision for me since ops isn't big in my area.  Otherwise beat up people, retrieve with Celebration and you should stay ahead of the curve.

vs. Big Blue- Fight alot.  I've had tremendous succes against big blue decks so far so let me know if you've got some nit picks here.  Redemption/Bacta Tank will help alot.

vs. Manipulation- Again not really big in my area although it does pop up.  That's what the Shock and Grabber are for.  Adjust as with above if the meta is different for you.

vs. Hunt Down/Dueling- This is the big deck here right now thanks to Mara Jade.  That's why I play all the duel cards [Glancing, Courage, and Swing-although they do have other uses for this deck as well], Ben, and sabers.	You also have the Visage counters including Boushh if need be.

vs. ISB- Same as ops.  This isn't that big in my area either although the suggested remedy is a Battle Plan and lots of fighting.

Any other comments then please let me know. '
