Strategy: '

I have played this deck since special edition and
even before then a variant on it.  Hunt down just
made the combo so much stronger.  If you dont know
the combo is Responibility of command and Much Anger
in him.  I have found that the most deadly thing about
the deck is the use of battle grounds.	In conjunction
with Come Here the opponent quickly finds that there
is nowhere to drain (or battle with mains).

Anyway i have never posted this deck.  In tournament
play it is undefeated for over 6 months and it has
taken out good high ranking players.  I tweak it
every once in a while.	I was hoping i could get some
other opinions.  The only deck that really gives it
some trouble is operatives but since the Bounty Hunter
starfighters Battle Order has been much more effective.
Tell me what you think.  Thankyou '
