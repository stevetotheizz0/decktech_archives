Shocking Info


'

Strategy: '

This is a ground deck that basically goes to DB’s and drains. With the extra activation you can get a pretty good beatdown. Another main point is to control Tatooine system. Use Lando in the Falcon, Dash and Leebo in the Outrider, and a freigher captain in the pulsar skate. 

I have way enough space. I played Edwin Harris’s (Edwin on Deck Tech) SFS deck and beat him up in space. Three ships is definitely enough because the Nar Shaddaa’s get the Captains and they pilot the ships with the matching pilots (all ships can add two pilots). Once I flip I can get two smugglers on a ship and add a destiny, giving me 6-8 power per ship with 2 destiny. Dash in the Outrider kicks cuz its power eight and can reduce any ships power by that.

Matchups


vs. RalOps

Control the air above Raltiir, and control the ground with freighter captains and mains. Don’t let their objective flip. Just control one site at a time and you’ll be alright.


vs. Court, MKOS, Black Sun, CCT

A tougher matchup because you can’t really match their alien beatdown potential. You have to do concentrated attacks, and keep a Fallen Portal in your hand the whole time (or in the lost pile once you flip), so their beatdown is slowed. Use Nar Shaddaa and On the Edge to retrieve about mid-game and get a second wind for attacks. A few well planned attacks and you’ll have your opponents on the run.


vs. SYFCA and all other big blue decks

Watch out for these deck, because your drains aren’t much on the ground, and theirs are a lot in space. This deck is featured around battling (to combat most of the popular decks in my area), but a drain race, especially with Sinier Fleet is one you probably won’t win. But if you can do some attacks in space with high attrition, and Dash on the Outrider to reduce power, you have a better chance. With all the sites you can get out automatically you can drain of 4, and you can get them out in one turn, so on turn two you can drain them of four constantly for the rest of the game. This is probably your best bet of winning. Use the grabbers to grab Short Range Fighters or All Power to Weapons or Dark Maneuvers (if they play with it). Over all it will be a hard game to win, with their retrieval all over the place and their force drains will be a lot, but you might have a chance if you play it right.


vs. Hunt Down

Brace yourself for a beatdown. Most Hunt Down deck would kill you with power in battles, but that what this deck was made for. Using the Fallen Portals and OOS, surprise their attackers with more characters and less for them. As against most other decks, attack at the right time and you will win. 


I hope you will find that you like this deck, and if you find anything wrong with it, please feel free to tell me.
