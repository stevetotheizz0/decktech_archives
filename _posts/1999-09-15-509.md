Strategy: '

Basically the same as my Light Fight deck that was criticized for weakness against Big Blue. I bought back 2 card slots by replacing the 2 Premier Obis with EPP Obis and getting rid of the 2 Obis Sabers. I dumped the Gift of the Mentor because the Lightsaber fetch function is no longer usable and very often I like to use ben and Luke as parts of separate strike teams.
 This deck is supposed to fight and force choke. Go for the beatdown. You must be careful not to get your mains stuck on and indoor location only to have your opponent play Imperial Arrest Order. Use Oola and Civil Disorder to keep your opponent deploying things piecemeal. I have only tried this deck against a big Blue type deck once. It did very well. The dark side could not muster enough force to fight effectively and stayed pretty much on the defensive the whole game.

Start Obi's hut. If your opponent starts Jabba's palace or the Audience chamber or both, use Careful Planning to get out Jabba's Palace.
Otherwise (except ISB), use Careful Planning to get out Tochi Station.
Get Obi or Luke to the station ASAP to gain the force activation. If they are playing Hunt Down wait until you have the anti dueling cards
in hand to deploy Ben or Luke.

I have cut back on the Revolutions because most good dark decks tend to imunize themselves by using non revolvable locations. Since most of these locations give the light side a some force as well, you should be activating plenty of force.
Use your opponent's locations against him/her. Revolve them, if this is to your advantage. Drain at his/her locations. Sense annoying interrupts and reacts. Alter Bad Feeling Have I and other effects.

Against Opperatives, go fight. Never let them flip.
Against ISB, use the signal to start Draw Their Fire and go for the beatdown with either Frozen Assets or Beggar.
