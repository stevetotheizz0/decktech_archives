Strategy: '

Improvements  I got Homing Beacon in for Landing Claw or just to converge every ship in the deck to a single location ;) Added Imperial Decree and switched some locations so that it can be set up. Added the Executor for more space power and Igar for a tad more ground power. Bubo to help out v. Undercover Spies or Ops. Other then that it is pretty much the same solid deck it was before.

v. Ops- Start Battle Order. You can mess around on their planet , try to set up ABC2theUni or Imperial Decree ASAP. Setup a few drains on the side. You can harass them like crazy and it'll be an excellent game. Bubo could possibly turn the tide.

v. MWYHL- Broken Concentration start will hurt
them and you can set up Walkers and pilots. Like
I said , ' Suprise Assault what ? ' . Secret Plans and CBHYBC should be able to bring them out and you can punish them when they do. And despite earlier comments I believe between CBHYBC , Secret Plans , Ability x3 , and all the drains I think by the time they flip their objective that the game will be basically be over. Grapple ICBW and they should slowly go off to never neverland.
Off course they'll also probably have to have someone occupy 2 battlegrounds and pay to retrieve
so you can probably beatdown on whoever comes out.

v. Mains and Toys- Spread out, Imperial Arrest
Order will do most of the work here. Battle Plan
kinda forces the EPPS to chose Space or ground
and with them out of one of the theatres you'll
be fine.

v. Yavin 4 w/ or w/o Revo- Death Star w/ Sec Pre
or IAOrder will make them play pretty careful.
Basically like Mains and Toys.

v. Hidden Base- Death Star , Security Pre , Battle Plan will usually slow down HBase. Grapple
Organized Attack and YOU WILL BE ABLE TO OUTLAST
AN X-WING SWARM )

v. anything else- I dunno I think that is all
you'll probably see. Its about a simple as a deck
as you can build.

Miscellaneous Notes Don't underestimate the power to look through your reserve ( M'kae , Secret Plans , Imperial Arrest Order , Twi'lek , etc. Once First Strike is rolling this deck is really tough on opponents.'
