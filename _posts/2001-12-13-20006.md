Strategy: '

this is another one i made for fun using admiral’s orders.  believe it or not, this deck is pretty solid once you can flip the objective.  the destroyers can shoot just about anything with those tracked 6’s, and in combination with Fighter Cover, lord maul + stick and p60/p59 can shoot or chop any jedi the opponent can throw at you.  too many jedi? tc-14 is the only solution for taking out qui-gon jinn, jedi master. 4-lom just doesn’t cut it anymore.  if anyone wants to drain you some other place, you’ve got your destroyers bargaining table, + you can’t lose more than 2.  if they’re draining you in space for alot, just use Tey How and eventually chase them down with your uber-fleet.  if you want to change things up a bit, just add U-3po, rollin rollin rollin, surface defense x2, you cannot hide forever, and maybe "enter the bureaucrat" or something like that.  this deck can easily be made ALL e1, but whatever.
