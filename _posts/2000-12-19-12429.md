Strategy: '

Ok lets get a few things straight before you review this deck.  I don’t care how you review this deck, just make sense.

Using this objective gives me solid force of that bat while providing me locations that I can work with.

1st turn usually goes like this, pull Madine & Calrissian.	Madine deploys for -1 at Rebel Landing Site, then Madine can pull Wuta, Wuta can pull Chief Chirpa’s Hut.

Next turn use Squad assignment to deploy to endor, the real game now begins.

One note, why play 2 Insight’s?  Cause it’s a great card that can pull a lot of things + a lot easier to kill Emperor, if I draw a 6 destiny I can kill him with just a blaster.

Against

Hunt Down, keep killing thier Vader’s with EPP’s, if they don’t put Ephant in Holotheatre invade it, if you cancel Visage you can ignore Vader.

BHBH, ok... use you spies to invade thier db’s and force choke them.  Hit the guy at the db with Draw Thier Fire + Frozen Assets.

Court, invade Audience Chamber.  Grab thier None Shall Pass, etc.  Hit them with Battle Damage & Kessel drain.

Ties, grab thier stuff, hit them with Order To Engage.

Other, invade where they are
