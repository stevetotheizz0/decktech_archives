Well this deck is pretty straight forward.  get out your aliens and run a muk w/ combos. this deck provide plenty of combos. 
4-LOM+Jabba+Ephant Mon+Boelo= mas destruction 
Super Mist Hunter= One ship dominance
Dr. Ev & Ponda+ Dengar w/ Gun= bye bye weeny characters
 With power of the hutt u can pull the sail barge on the 1st turn w/ the passanger deck and u get 2 extra force. also u can put jabba on there and your aliens deploy minus 2(3 if u get scum out).  u can also pull 3 aliens and Jabbas Cruiser late rin the game. Some people ask y i have cards like expand the empire in my deck.  well think about it if u put it on the audience chamber u get 3 aliens when u want. if on the moisture farm u get force drain and weapon destinies +1 @ adjecant sites. Ghhk is for late in the game when ur about to die and need that one character to take an @#$% whoopin and stop a drain. tatooine occupation adds insult to injury when u get tatooine out.J’Quille is the best alien in the Jabba’s Palace set and u better use him.  he get ride of the big nasty(chewy) real quick. Kitik Keed’kek is in there b/c it justs kicks @#$% w/ eight power.
and last but not least Rappertunie takes characters power to 0 in battle.  All u gotta do is get ur cards out and start whoopin up on people. A no brainer!
