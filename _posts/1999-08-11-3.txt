Strategy: 

This deck is just what its called, Dark Domination. This deck is a equal balance of ground beatdown and superior space. You start with either of the Rebel base locations, usually Hoth: Ice Plains unless your opponent is playing a revolution deck. Start with any one of the effects according to your opponents deck. Try to get out sites as fast as possible and get down your effects, the effects are especially important, they are your "white blood cells". Deploy your starships and vehicles and start force draining. With all the effects and interrupts, you are not at any risk of beat down by any deck.
You may want to change the deck around according to your local meta.
