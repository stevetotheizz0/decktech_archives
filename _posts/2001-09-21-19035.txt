Strategy: '

Well, I figured everyone and their sister was playing some form of WYS, so I figured I would try to play it before the Defensive Shield card that kills it comes out.  I had looked around at some other popular WYS decks, and decided I would blend the Kessel Run strategy of Hayes Hunters WYS, and use a little of that Run Luke Run beatdown that everyone is arguing over who started.  I also decided to podrace with a generic Podracer.   I saw Jeremy Lamere play podracing like this at the Denver DPC, and A Step Backwards guarantees the race is yours.  

Since everyone has already played with a version of WYS, and I am the last person in the world to play with this silly objective, I wont insult your intelligence with a detailed strategy section.  Basically, you win the race, retrieve.  Do a Kessel Run, and retrieve.  Do another Kessel Run, retrieve.  When they come to ground, deploy Han and a smuggler, preferably Karrde, deploy Luke at an adjacent site, initiate with Han, play IHABFAT, RLR, and DGC, and kill your opponent in one battle, maybe two.   

This is the first time I am playing WYS, so any help or suggestions you can give me would be greatly appreciated.
