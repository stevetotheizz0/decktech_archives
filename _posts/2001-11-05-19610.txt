Strategy: 

strat
1. flip fast and do dammage.
2. use resistance, projective and stuff to slow what opponent does. 
3. reinforce tat or do hit and run with extra guys

ok first always pull watto from the deck. if you have a cheap guy like korrey or anus deploy them to flip. if not use power of the hutt to pull a guy. else use it to pull hutt influence, that card wins games. flip and lay wattos cube which will cycle into the deck and opponent loses 2.  the next few turns consist of reinforcing your sites on tat and finding defensive stuff. you only really need to hold 3 sites but there are 4 bgs incase something happens.  the walkers+ trample is a good combo. the deck works because you slow the opponent and choke him and so fast damage eats him before he can respond. alternate damage comes from aaa and search/destroy. i may add no escape, but so far i don’t need it. i can get 3 bg fast plus not as many people use honor. 

new dueler-resistance is good. you get good activation so use it. dammage fast.  i’d stay away from naboo unless you have a really strong attack force.

wys-fast damage. trample is huge. his name anakin is also big. use the new card to stop interrupt abuse. its not easy but you can win.

hbflip-hutt influence. trample spys. direct damage. oh yeah theres that 1 card thats good vs hb, whats its name, like security something or whatever

qmc-interesting match. they have good drains and decent retrevial. i would setup lightly (1 or 2 sites) at tat, then try for beats on cc or at bespin. you may be able to make them lose key cards early, which will help.

other-be agressive. flip fast then draw defensive cards. you hve the advantage most of the time so use it.

lmk what ya think.
