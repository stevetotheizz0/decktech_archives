Strategy: 

Ok first, I would like to have some constructive reviews because I’d like to try this deck to a local tourney and I ain’t sure how it’s gonna perform.

The third starting effect is usualy YOU CANNOT HIDE FOREVER to get perimeter patrol ASAP.

This is your standard Imperial command Star destroyer with tempest scout endor operation deck.

No real strategy beside keeping the opponent out of your few endor sites (using perimeter patrol and other guys such as Fenson) and then drain him out in space.

Things I’d like to add: 

- more scanning screws
- Limited ressource
- Lateral damage

and yes I am a scrubs... who need help! ^.^

Thanks
