Strategy: '

Joe Pestro can suck it.  Played this deck for the 1st time post-Coruscant w/ almost no changes (1 Nemodian Advisor for Endor was the only significant change) and it went 3-0 (2 wins over WYS, 1 on time and a win over QMC).  So, I guess the deck still works, no clue how it’d do against senate though, I don’t even know what those cards do yet...


Oh, forgot to mention, this deck is much like a deck I played a year ago which was designed after a deck that Tim Guzman posted here on DeckTech, so props to him.


Currently this deck is 7-0 in tournament play, beating 3 WYS decks played by 3 good players (TJ Holman, Chris Gogolembo and Andy Talaga).


This is how you play the deck

1st you setup in the Audience Chamber (cause losing force to your own objective is lame).  Usually its w/ Jabba (who you get w/ the AC text), Boelo and Ephant Mon (who you get w/ Power of the Hutt) however this is optional.  Sometimes a 1st turn Mara w/ Stick is a good way to put pressure on your opponent.  If you think your opponent lacks characters you can go fetch Gallid to boost the drains a little bit.  Usually itll be the above mentioned 3 though.  From there you pile guys in the AC, but not the guys who go in space.  Clearly Xizor and Guri are to be put on their ships, Danz makes a nice pilot for Zuckuss in MH, and 4-LoM should be held until you know if you need him in space or the ground.


Ideally youll wait for your opponent to deploy to space first, but if need be you can lure them into space by deploying there 1st.  Barrier will help here.  Once you establish control of a system and a site you just sit there and drain, go do suicide runs to retrieve force and kill your opponents characters or whatnot.  Get in a big Elis beatdown if need be.


Why do you play certain cards?


3 grabbers - 3 grabbers is large.  Especially against WYS, dont let them play an interrupt more then once.  W/ 3 grabbers you can grab just about anything, and still have 1 left.


All these jank bounty hunters - Theyre all forfeit +2 and immune to Goo Nee Tay, which is nice.  Jodo cancels that 2nd destiny all those WYS decks are getting.  Others draw destiny on their own which makes for a nice hit and run mission.


Operational as Planned - Helps to increase your average destiny a little, can help setup a tracked 0 to overload something, and leaves you a force to Barrier if your opponent has out I Did It.


2 Overloads - X-Wing cannons wreck you, 2 Overloads means youll prolly see 1 by the time you need it.


The Matchups


vs. WYS - you own this deck  Between Zuckuss and Guri theyll be drawing 1 destiny at most in space, if they manage to get 7 ability (which they have trouble getting early, and trouble keeping as the fight goes on).  You get 7 force 1st trun, which means Jabba and Boelo, although Mara w/ stick is decent if you have a Barrier to back her up with.  They will usually deploy to space early, not prepared for the smackdown you can provide w/ multiple destiny draws in space.  Once you kick them out of space, Battle Order wrecks.


vs. QMC - again, you own space.  Dont even deploy a planet system, just take theirs.  Battle Order wrecks w/ their limited activation.  Elis might even do you some good as most dont play Insurrection.  Theyll play their anti-battle cards but youll be retrieving force and will grab all their retrieval and win.


vs. RST - own space again  Battle Order is big.  If its boomrace, well, you lose the podrace, but who cares?  You should try to prevent them from blowing the bunker however.  You have enough guys to go battle, and you keep retrieving them.  Ideally Mara can hold the AC (w/ Boelo) for you, freeing other characters to go fight on Endor.


vs. Profit - track your systems (youre searching your reserve deck for docking bays) and get them into play.  Drain them there, and fortify the AC.  You can draw a ton of destinies on the ground just as you can in space.  Start off w/ Jabba and Mara in the AC.


vs. Force Choke/Mains - this is your tough matchup.  If you dont get your systems early you wont get much activation and they will come hard to take over the AC.  Even if you lose control of the AC, you should drain them in space.  If theyre playing heavy Revo you basically get bent over, oh well.


vs. Hidden Base - Court damage + drains is enough.  You can put up a nice fight in space, retrieving all the while.  Probing should be no problem for you.  Make them deploy to space 1st, then try to put on a beatdown.  Battle Order comes out once you get a foothold in space, if they come to the ground you Elis and beat them around.  If theyre playing Insurrection make sure you hold enough ground power to fight whatever they put down (usually Luke/Qui-Gon). 


There you have it.  This deck wins, but more importantly, its fun to play.  The Camp really doesnt do much to this type of scum deck, +1 deploy isnt a big deal, and its rarely seen.  Dunno how itll need to be adapted for Coruscant play, havent looked at the new cards, but Ill work on that later. - Mike D.     '
