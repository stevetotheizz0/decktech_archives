Strategy: '

Since there is a good chance just about every
one on here has seen some sort of Throne Room
deck I'll skip to individual cards.
Transmission TermI think this is better than
just going to the Executor as you have to devote
too much.Plus there is still a bothan and
chimes to get to it just in case.Most people
don't use it in this deck,I do.

Alter is in due to the fact that it helps against
a Raltiir starting w/Bad Feelin'(popular around
here)Thats good enough reason right there.

H'nemthe rules early game against Raltiir and Hunt
Down and will make them pay late game as its
harder to get any thing out.Goo Nee Tay only
adds to this.

The ships should be enough to go to space.
The optimun Scenario is GLinG1 w/Claw blocking
a drain while you load up the Redemption and use Bacta Tank. Lando in Falcon is just too good to
pass up

9 sites may be cutting it close but it suits
me.(Take out a few interrupts to add more)

All in all a good deck w/high destinies and alot
of flexibility which is key for the light side.

Sorry about such little strategy but the basics
have been covered time after time and I figure
people are getting a little sick of this deck as it is.

Enjoy
