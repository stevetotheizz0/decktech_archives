Strategy: '

This is one heck of a CCT deck. It uses sabbac to retrive lots and battles big. DOn’t get me wrong, I dont totally rely on Sabbac, but it is a major part of the deck.

This deck is great because it limits off 2 of the lights sides big guns Lando and Han. THis can greatly limit thier space and make them come to the ground. Thats when you lay the smack down.

After you get your hand, pull lando and Rendilli. Activate and search for CC DB. CHeck to see if both of you casino’s are in there. If they arent, draw up. If they are, deploy lando and someone else to the prison to hold han. From there just get out your sites from Reserve and get han to Audince chamber. Get lando, Lobot, Barqun, and mayb boba to the casino to play some sabbac and retrive lost force.

MATCHUPS
EBO Invade hoth, PLay lateral damage on the falcon or whoever and beatdown. Play sabbac to win thier ships and retrive force. also retrive force from scum and your objective.

Hidden Base Tough Game. Plan your battles wisely, play sabbac and win thier ships (MEAN) then play alteral damage and beatdown. SHouldn’t be too hard.

TIGIH Ha Go in and kill luke with iggy and 4-lom and arica. easy game.

AGENTS Try to kill the rep. play sabbac to retrive force.

anything else React to what opponent does.

THANKS FOR REVIEWING
