Strategy: '

This is basically a revision(although barely revised) of the same deck Ohmy Fasudhani used to win the Mt. View Grand Slam.

The deck plays simple, get Vader down and flip the Objective and let Visage do it's thing. The classic start is with Crush the Rebellion. Now heres the key part of the game......dont battle if you can avoid it.

If you take a look at the overall deck, the destinys really dont go very far in a battle. Normally you wont kill off more than 1 person per battle, even less should they have Ben Kenobi. This is why you have to pick your fights....fight only when you need to, run away if the battles get too dangerous for you to handle.

This decks major strength is in its ability to cope towards any LS deck. I think this decks weakness is in Out of Commision. If Vader gets knocked from play youre left with your low destinies and alot of Imperial lackeys to fight against Ben and his buddies. Your Sense/Alters will also usually be sucessful even if the Objective isnt flipped, so try it.
