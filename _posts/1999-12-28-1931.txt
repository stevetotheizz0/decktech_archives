Strategy: '

Hmmm, let's see, what to do with 64 'extra' force during my activation phase.  well I could loop out of commission just a few times to ensure vader doesn't come back, or I could retreive all my lost force with on the edge, or I could get all my EPP's in hand and still have enough force left to deploy them in one big beat down.  Just imagine the possibilities.	I think that right now, if one could activate enough force, the Descent into the Dark/Hiding in the Garbage combo is the strongest out there right now for the darkside.  This deck just needs a couple it can waits for ships at BCC. '
