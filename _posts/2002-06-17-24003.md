Strategy: '

 
This is my first WYS deck and I don’t know the secrets. I played it once to test and it beat a good profit deck (oh man, down to the wire though, had one card left).


Anyway, I want to know what cards seem useless and what cards seem missing. I want it to stay ground and space, and I know it doesn’t drain very well and doesn’t retrieve force, but it is made to battle and that is what I’m going for. I think it works. What do you think?


I deploy kessel fast as possible, flip the objective as fast as possible and start the chains moving. When I am drained, I either get rid of a lost interrupt, a duplicate of a character in play, or a few maneuvers, and then I come back with the interrupts later on. (WYS deck, you get it)



Max force drain from space = 4

Max force drain from land = 4


It is equal in space and land and I want to keep that. I love lost interrupts Good for tech.


Too many controls?

Too many few maneuvers?


Any advice at all?
