Strategy: 

Silly me thought that the strategy behind a deck with 10 scanning crews would be pretty bloody obvious.  Apparently not.

1) I do not want to flip the objective because the objective is crap.  Freezing is @#$%.  It is a waste of time.  Don't tell me to flip the objective.

2) There are three TBHTP's in there because of a card called 'Shocking Information.'  Shocking Information is a bad card.  Therefore we use TBHTP to stop it from being played multiple times.

3) Frustration.  Frustration is a miserable card, and a waste of space in a deck like this.  You are just going for pot luck if you use it to try to deal with What're You Trying To Push On Us.  Apart from anything else, even if you do get Frustration to go off and hit a What're You Trying To Push On Us, it means you still can't use Scanning Crew until after WYTTPOU leaves your opponent's hand.

4) Hidden Base is not a problem, because you have Battle Plan.	They need to continue to pay to drain ('cause you scanning crew their characters), and you hold off deploying any ships until Security Precautions is out and about.  In addition, Search And Destroy will be an additional drain of 2 effectively.

5) Sabacc/Casino.  Are you guys serious?  This is crap.  5 card combo to POSSIBLY retrieve 2 or 3 force a turn?  Never mind if you lose...

6) And for the moron who said 'Where's Boba,' the answer is "in his ship."  Scum and Villany only works if you have no Imperials/Imperial Starships on the table.	As is SO OBVIOUSLY THE CASE HERE, there are numerous non-Aliens here.

Grab any Shocking Informations, use Security Precautions to kill Hidden Base, and AAA and S+D for extra damage.
