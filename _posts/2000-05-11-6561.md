Strategy: '

It's very easy to play, play the main Characters in Space or in Ground and begin drain as soon as possible. Interrupts an effects are to protect them or to bring them a lot of destiny. This deck have a good average of destiny, I obtain a total dest. of 19 only with the Millenium F. Capt. Solo, Luke & Punch It, this battle make me win the play and go down with the Executor and two pilots without any problem.
Try it and Good luck.  '
