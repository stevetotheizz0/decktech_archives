Strategy: '

The way i see it dark side is lagging right now.
light side has so many good deck themes, that
it makes it hard for the dark side to win.
this can't win all of it's games but i have about 2 out
of three with it.
It has lots of high destiny that you can track..
playing six vader's is always cool also.
It has trouble beating opp's and rev/nudj, but whatever.
it is a good beat down deck that is cool to play.'
