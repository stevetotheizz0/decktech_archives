READ STRATEGY BEFORE REVIEWING(Changes in decklist , see response to Jeeps)


----- Response to the reviews -----------


Flufner  thanks for your review, you are a great player


Jeeps  Ok , if both of you think so I have to agree

IN   *BANTHA DROID , OUT  3PO

      *Juke , Rebel Scout , OUT  Jedi Luke

      *Chewbacca,Protector , OUT  Chewbacca with gun ( now that im not using C-3PO anymore , hes better)

But I dont agree on anakins saber cause i always test with LEIA , so keep it ( +1defence value)

Other changes  in Captain Han Solo x1 out  Han EPP x1


----------------------------


I will first explain why some rathar strange cards and WHY play MWYHL again.

If your just interrested in the machups , skip the first section. Thanx for reading.

Please give a fair review that contains some personal ideas of the deck and improvments.

I ONLY TEST till 3 because it otherwise takes to many card slots.The greatest test are 1-3 , because there not hard to do.



*Why This? / Why That?


a)C-3PO??????  Well , He has 2 purposes in this deck. First of all , hes ment for Court of the vile , and MKOS decks...The dude isnt a spy , so boe to all those players who thought there where save with Ephant Mon on the ChamberHere you go , a gift.Its more like a Troyan , when you open it you will notice that your destinys(battle) are -2.The extra -1 from Domein Of Evil

will give a battle destiny -3 to Court and those Set Your Course audience chamber decks , and a -1 to MKOS when its flipped.GREAT

Second , less important tough , he adds a nice destiny with Chewbacca and gives an extra 2 power.


b)Honor Of The Jedi  Ive been playing a lot of tournaments the past months and I found out that DS players dont think they need No EscapeHow many times that Ive heard  The fear that NO ESCAPE exist is enough , so you dont need it anymore is uncountable.Well for all those  WRONG Im playing Honor , search and other things wont hurt me...And if they think that theyll get 3 BATTLEGROUNDS , they just can aswel forget it.This is a beatdown deck and HONOR still rocks


c)Uncontrollable Furry  Tough Lord Vader is a popular card , theres a big chance they deploy Chocke vader or an other one instead.In many other games this card could have saved me , but it wasnt in. No that I now how WRONG that I was , its definatly a keeper.


d)We Dont Need their Scum  THE CARD of the moment Too may people play either an mixup alien / Imperial or a LOT of Bounty Hunters

Combined with some great tracking , you can drain their power to 0 and your attrition to 0.

Try it out , and youll see what I mean.


e)BO SHUDA + ORDER  A well known COMBO with great effectivety against retrive scum decks blocking a force drain and their retrival.


f)Luke with Saber  This dude is GOD vs BHBM , go and slice Emperor on first turn )If It fails , try again , again , again ... You can trow some forfeit with it and crush the sites needed for HONOR or S&D.


g)GOO NEE TAY  Great protection vs Miiyoom Oniths game text , making it a 1-1 sucker.

If you can get this card on your first turn vs Scum deck , youll be finding yourself on the way to a easy victory.TRULY , count if you will how MANY aliens a dark deck plays with ABILITY >2

*TO TAKE SIR YODAs INVICIBLE COURT AS EXAMPLE  11 So , you see , this card will have it use during your game.



*****MATCHUPS*****


vs BRING HIM  Start with Do Or Do Not / Theres no Try , Battle Plan and The Way of Things.

Get that Luke swapping out of your reserve and slice that Emperor into 1000 pices of concentrated energyAt the right time , give him a hard day with your eloms and We dont need their scum.With a +3 to drain , force drain bonuses gone , his destenies -1 and abilty six needed everywhere this should come down to a nice game. At the appripate time , give him the Jedi Knight, so his cross destenies are -4 ( 3 from luke and -1 from the test)


vs Hunt Down  Forbide hunting ) Start Do or Do Not / No try , Battle Plan , and The Way of Things. Use your spies and or transmission terminated s well , get mean with Luke and hes dead ( cross destiny -5-1*2 + Lukes -3 , i wouldnt dear it , would you????)

Give him a hard time on the ground and youll see that HUNT DOWN isnt as good as some people tought it was


vs MKOS  Start BATTLE PLAN , SQ ASSIGNMENTS and THE WAY ...  That would have been by far the hardest matchup next to Set your course , but with all the anti-alien , this game is , if you get your combos out, a laugh.

Honor = NO S&D , +Bo Shuda + Order = A Battleground less and force drain less , lower passages = GET YOUR GIFT There , so theyll be draining for 1 or 2  Mammie , im affraid )

Did a mention that his	battle destinies are - 1 ( or 3 when he isnt flipped )GRIMTASSH when he goes over 12


vs Court  Do the same as against MKOS , and theyll have it even tougher , because there battle destenies  are -3 , due the gift and Jedi Test 3.Come a bit faster to Tatooine now , unless they dont play NO ESCAPE . Just play wise ,  give a grimtaash if neccesary , track and youll win with not a bit of trobbles.


SET YOUR COURSE start the same as vs MKOS. TAKE OUT that bangus GLEEGive your opponent a hard time on the ground and win. Youll be very happy when its an AUDIENCE chamber deck , otherwise you should also have no trobbles


THANKS AND ENJOY

OLIVIER De Ridder

I will post strategy upon reviews
