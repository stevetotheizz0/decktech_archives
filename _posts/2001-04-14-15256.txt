Strategy: 

Please, don´t rate untill you´ve read all the strategy section. Thanks in advance to all who spend his time on this.

This is the deck I am now playing. It has huge activation (normally 10 by turn 2) and big drain and battle potential.
Turn #1: Search for DS: War Room and Coruscant: DB so you can activete big in turn 2. If you have draw Merrejk, deploy him to Dath Star except you have Emperor Palpatine in hand, in this case, forget Merrejk for this turn and deploy Palpy. If you have an Imperial Command in hand search for an admiral or general (Ozzel is cool for this turn). Then draw everything you can.
Turn #2: If Merrejk now in hand deploy him to Death Star and search for a system. If you don´t draw everything and search him, remember you can look trought your deck for a DB or DS location so you can know what is in your force pile.
Turn #3: from this turn and on you will activate a lot so you can do heavy beatdowns at ground and have cool power in space. Despite this remember that Chranau is very important to overdrain your opponent so search for him asap.

Some of the most important cards:
-Imperial Command: the really key card of the deck. Cool in space and ground.
-Admiral Chiranau: heavy drains.
-Admiral Orders: help to deploy with less cost and increase or give inmunity for your ships.
-YCNHF: cool against main and odds decks and search for Security Precautions.
-Put All Sections In Alert: help a lot to mantein control of Death Star.

And against the Light Side:
1) MWYHL: good deck, even without your force drain bonus, you have quite good drain potential.
2) WYS: another good deck but you will be really better at space an you can easily kill him down.
3) RST: outdrain him in space and control one or two of his locations.
4) RTP: I´ve played a lot against this and can do nothing against my deck, no matter how it´s played.
5) HB: hard play, you must search for his HB asap and beware of beatdowns. Despite this with your admirals in the Star Destroyers and Imperial Command in hand you will have good chances to win.
6) EBO: very similar to HB, beware of beatdowns in space and try to control Hoth.

That´s all I can think in, if you have any suggestions please d-mail me or post in your rates.
Thanks for rating and reading till the end.
