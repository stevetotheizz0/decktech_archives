Strategy: '

Basic Strategy Start Obi's Hut, and if the opponent is playing nothing that requires some counter measures, start Careful Planning and Tosche Station.

Vs. HDADTJ Start Goo Nee Tay. Anti-duel stuff is Courage of a Skywalker + Glancing Blow. Use the spies (Momaw Nadon + Jeroen Webb) to cancel Visage if it's left undefended. Try to get out Wise Advice quick if they are playing SAC.

Vs. Drazin/CCT Start Scrambled Transmisson to slow them down. Give them Wedge or Jeroen Webb to start. Try to deploy stuff quickly to avoid Scanning Crew, in my environment, no one plays Scannign crew, so you may want to sub 2 Shocking Info's for Grimtaash's or It Could Be Worse. Use your spies to pop into the Security Tower for a nice surprise )

Vs. TIE Swarm, or Asteroid Tech Try to out-drain them on the ground. Tackle the weakest space force, and grapple Short Range Fighters or All Power to Weapons. Savrip and Bacta Tank will also help here.

Vs. Big Blue See above strategy for TIE's, also may want to sub in Socking Info's if Big Blue is prominent in your environment.

Vs. Ops Start Battle Plan, then commence beats on their weakest locations. It Could Be Worse will also slow them down.

Misc. That's all I can really think of, if the opponent is playing with the ECC Objective, try and control Bespin system, maybe sub in Surreptious Glance for Grimtaash's if you know people will be playing this deck archetype. Also try to beat them down, and gain some CC control before they can drop Dark Deal.  '
