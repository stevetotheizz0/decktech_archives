Strategy: 

Pretty typical QMC deck. Pull Crix, docking bay and a scrubby scout first turn. You can use Insight to grab Insurrection, but I like to wait and use it to grab Close Air, Menace Fades or Insurrection, whichever u think u may need. I’m kinda busy right now so I can’t make a more complete strategy. I will probably fill in a little more later. In the meantime, you can check out another QMC decks to see how they work if you are unsure.
