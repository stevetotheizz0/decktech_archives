Strategy: '

SuperFalcon rules...
No matter what version of TIGIH you play, there is one rule.
ALWAYS DRAIN AT CHIEF CHIRPA’S HUT FIRST TURN

Match ups

vs. BHBM
let luke get captured quick... the high destinies will help luke win duels. cross vader. its over quick. if they don’t feel like dueling, the beatdown will take care of vader, and they’ll have to lose 2 force when the emperor ends up escorting luke..mwhaha.

vs. HD
Nothing major, always keep a fallen portal in your hand don’t deploy a system unless you have to, it just gives your opponent somewhere to run to so they don’t have to play 3 to drain. drain heavy in space.

vs. Court and MKOS
Drain heavy in space. use undercover blount and r2 to block their drains. beat down at the chamber. against Myo MKOS’s, drop down premiere obi at the chamber and pay the one to move myo away. there goes their game.

vs. ISB
Drop blount with obi-wan at coruscant or put him aboard the spiral or superfalcon at coruscant system.

vs. Ralops
use the spies to block drains. drain as fast as you can in the sky. try to get luke captured, as many ralops decks play with few vaders, and they’ll end up losing 2 force a turn when they’ve got captain dumass is escorting luke. not too hard.

vs. CCT
Beat down on the way to the chamber. not-so-superfalcon w/ lando if you have to...
