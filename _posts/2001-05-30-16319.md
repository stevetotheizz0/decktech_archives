Strategy: '

Start

RST/GD, Endor, Endor RLS, HFTMF for Insurrection, Strike Planning, and The Shield Is Down


Strategy

After you draw your hand, pull Crix.  After activating, pull Back Door and Landing Platform (or another DB if LP not there), drop Crix to RSL if you have Kensaric in hand or saw him in your deck (in which case, you’d use Crix’s text to pull him).  2nd turn, you’ll have mad activation.

Dont flip early; you’ll want to have heavy activation early in case your opponent forces a battle here or there.

Get Ben and Qui-Gon (well, QG can be deployed wherever you want, but is -2 to Tatooine) out to the Tatooine DB, and get them to Endor.  With this, along with Jedi Luke, spread at all three sites, will give you full control of Endor; you can Fallen Portal 2 sites, Run Luke Run, and Jedi Presence for clinching ground battles.  With Midge and Graak-enhanced drains, you should be able to do a fair amount of damage.

On the weapons, Anakin’s Lightsaber is for either Luke or DOS, depending on the situation, and the Jedi sabers are for Ben and Qui-Gon.  I chose the non-uniques because they can go to anyone in a hurry, and Qui-Gon still gets to use it for free.

With Insertion Planning, you can take the fight to other exterior planet sites if need be, but only with a Jedi in tow for safety.

Once flipped, you’ll be able to retrieve scouts, and you can also Noble Sac someone for quick gains, then later track for Off The Edges.
