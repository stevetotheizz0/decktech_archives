Strategy: '

you just have to force choke your opponent than start to retrieve with harvest but if your opponent keep some force to grab it
than use beggar to get rid of those force than play harvest
and if he deploy, use your epp to win the big fight
and for space use it could be worse+the super falcon+retrieve
this deck right now is THE MACHINE

for those who think HD kick my but
just look at my report my light side is 3 and 0
and won against 2 HD w SAC
and when you active 15 to 20 force secret plans dont hurt at all  '
