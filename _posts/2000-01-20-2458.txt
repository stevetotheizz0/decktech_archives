Strategy: 

simple-use the obj to get out your ships-use space & clouds to drain them.

vs. hb: start sec. precautions. probe, battle and drain.

vs.mwyhl: star broken concentration, use he is not ready, and if needed send vader and mara down to chill with yoda on dagobah.

vs.ycepbt/obd-put out jabba and ephant mon for free. get vader,mara and whoever else to chhamber while you drain like a madman in space.

vs.qmc-control one cloud sector they're screwed.

vs. choke-i get 5 force to start with, plus i hve 11 locations.

vs.anything else: get some guys to the chamber for protection from mini-visage,  dont get beatdown on ground and jack them in space.

this is my first try with this deck. also you probally know this but i don't filp this objective (unless i use hutt smooch on boussh, not likely though).
