Strategy: '

simple-use the obj to get out your ships-use space & clouds to drain them.

vs. hb start sec. precautions. probe, battle and drain.

vs.mwyhl star broken concentration, use he is not ready, and if needed send vader and mara down to chill with yoda on dagobah.

vs.ycepbt/obd-put out jabba and ephant mon for free. get vader,mara and whoever else to chhamber while you drain like a madman in space.

vs.qmc-control one cloud sector they're screwed.

vs. choke-i get 5 force to start with, plus i hve 11 locations.

vs.anything else get some guys to the chamber for protection from mini-visage,  dont get beatdown on ground and jack them in space.

this is my first try with this deck. also you probally know this but i don't filp this objective (unless i use hutt smooch on boussh, not likely though).
