Strategy: '

-- I have no clue how this wandered back into the top 10(or how it got there in the first place for that matter) but this is one of the alternates to Mo Murder along with Blue Harvest.  It is a strong MWYHL deck but it is all about patience and control.  The speed of this is almost exactly the opposite of my others, so I like it as a change of pace.  Enjoy


The good ’ole Mind deck...  man I still like this one.  It just gets better as time goes on.


If you don’t know how to play MWYHL by now... what rock were you hidden under?  Use the text of Dagobah to pull a site, usually training area if it is not in hand, use other texts to pull and deploy tests, mentor, trainee, etc.. deploy sites in this arrangement.


Swamp>Training Area>Yoda’s Hut>Bog Clearing>Jungle


This makes it difficult for the opponent to bring the pain (if they bother to try) as it strands thier vehicles then sinks them to bottom of lost pile. 


Otherwise just train away and keep watch over your destinies and locations as you do your searching.  I have enough stuff in here that most tests are automatic, if not the destiny is good enough to make it.  Once you flip the game is yours to win.  Use you forces for a decisive battle on the ground or in the air.  There is enough stuff for Jedi Test 4 to find and destroy the opponent.


On/Off the Edge combo with Luke or Obi at the CC/Lower Corridor is kinda rediculous, especially if you have moved the muppet back to his hut.  I keep a deck similar to this built and on reserve...  just in case I don’t feel like playing RTP or WYS that day.
