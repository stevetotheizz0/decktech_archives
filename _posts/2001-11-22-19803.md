Wise Advice

Your Insight serves you well






The deck i used at FreedomCon to win it.

It lost Game 1 to Matt Bertas Huntdown, only to win the next 6 games.


Matt played Huntdown, which is a pretty bad matchup although certainly not an auto-loss.

Against everything else you definitely have a good shot.

No deck can win against everything these days.


Mad props to Fabien Jacques for convincing me to add Alternatives to fighting.

That card is huge
