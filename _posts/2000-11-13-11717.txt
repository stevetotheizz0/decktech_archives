Strategy: '

simple   they WILL come to you.....just destroy them.....;]
but.....make sure you read the cards....it pays off
they NEED to sense them if the are playing BHBM  let him...he looses it & 2 more....he will run out.then you are still there & you kill him ;]
it WORKS DONT COMPLAIN @#$%ING TRY IT



i dont care what you think of my deck.....if you rate it low.....fine but i will write back to you to counter your dumb ideas about my deck...i am better than most of you(being kind) & KNOW BETTER also

also....if you think it sucks well YOU SUCK so look at the deck read the cards & think about it REAL hard, & i am sure it will come to you
