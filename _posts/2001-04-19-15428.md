Strategy: '

Ok, hi everyone  Welcome to the wonderful world of hidden x-wings.


Good deck, but too many cannons. I would add Mirax and her ship asap as they are cool for tracking. You only need 3 or 4 Organized Attack, and with the free slot add Kessel Run. Also try to add Luke´s stick for better beatdown capacity. 

 	Garion


Hi garion, thanks for the post. The point of the deck is the cannons, I would much rather have two destinys of 5 floating around insted of a 2 and a 3 that I’m able to track destinys (which I must admit that I’m not the best at).  I not only use the organized attack for the used part but also for the lost part, so I need the extra’s (plus, their destiny 5’s).  Luke is in the deck only for BHBM, nothing else, and the reason I’m using Jedi luke insted of Rebel Luke is because jedi luke is destiny 6 and subtacts 3 from dueling.


Your match-ups seem really optimistic ”MKOSYeah, this deck has some troubles, but don’t worry, block drains and just keep up”. What about Hutt Influence? 

 	Morgoth


Well Morgoth,  I like to keep a obimistic view on things, I much rather say what I said other than ”Yeah, this deck sucks, I should not have made it in the first place because EVERYONE plays MKOS”.  next time, don’t rate a deck because of what I wrote for match ups.


Looks tough. Nothing too special about this version of X-Wing swarm. You give DS alot of force to work w/...5 systems, so finding your HB isnt too hard. No protection from Monnok, so your X-Wings and Cannons are toast. And MKOS+ Hutt Influence= prayers to find your Undercover spies in time. I dont think this is anything Id rely on...due to the fact that Hunt Down and MKOS drain for so much, so quick, whereas this is gonna have a few turns searching for systems...spies...and TT. 



 	Mage


Mage, I know I give the dark side alot of force, but they only activate 6 while I activate 13.  Remember the Strike Planning and Endor.  I Know quite well that I have no Monnok protection, but this deck is made so you don’t keep all your X-wings and Cannons in your hand, you drop em’ as soon as you get em’.  Again with the MKOS, I know quite well Hutt Influence is a killer to this deck, but again, NOT EVERYONE PLAY MKOS”


here is how it works

Ok, first turn you grab General Calrissan and Endor, drop all x-wings in your hand to RP and use SA to get gold squadron 1 and play both Calrissan and the ship to endor for 3 force, move all x-wings over for free and draw up. Next pull Aquras and move your fleet to there and play more xwings and move to endor.  stop force drain not only with objective but also with Boussh, TK-422, and rebel fleet. So stop 5 force drains a turn, then do a massive retrevial with all wings report in. Some things I want to add Colonel Salm,   tech for operitives.  Lt. Blount, tech for ISB..just in case you wanted to know. -)

Cards I want to put in

X-Wing assaul squadron-get three more x-wings back to stop more drains.

Another concentrate all fire-I dont have a second


matchups

HDADTJ/TFHGOITU

Yes, cancle visage as earily as possble. stop drains, and drain them.


MKOS

Yeah, this deck has some troubles, but dont worry, block drains and just keep up.


COTVG

Yeah, tough match, get down a undercover spy to tatooine earliy so the objective dosent hurt you


Big Blue

SQUISH All I have to say, this deck is very very fast and can just rip it apart.  As for TIE swarm decks just go stright to Wakillimui (or what ever)


Any other kind of deck

just play normal, have fun, dont be dumb. Stop drains and drain them.


have fun, remember, its only a game.
