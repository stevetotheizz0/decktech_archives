Strategy: '

Ok this is an allaround Fun-Deck.You can battle, drain just all you want.Strategy is simpleflip and drain da hell out of opponent with Chiraneau + ISB agents.

If opponents wants to battle then kill him.Vader + Tarkin together with Commander Igar with Walkers should be great for this, but space is much stronger with super Chimaera and Bounty Hunters.


matchups


Hidden Base - get Security Precautions out and probe with Boba and Chimaera.Block his drains with ships and Den of Thieves.S&D and drains will kill him.


Dagobah - your drains are enough without bonuses together with S&D.Should be tough though.


WYS - get the damn droid to Tatoinne and dominate space.Never played one myself so I think you can giove me some advice.


EBO - Ships should be able to hold one or two systems, together with S&D and ground drains you should win.If it is meta in your area put in Imperial decree and get your ISBs to Hoth.


Thats all, I hope I get some reviews so I can see what I can do better.One last thing fear Blount??? Just kill him  '
