Strategy: '

Strategy

Start with IAO, unless you are expecting a nudj deck with a lot of revo's. Then use Crush.
Against ops you start battle order

Oops I forgot to type down search and destroy, lose one t'wilek (in our region numbers are very common) otherwise drop a torture

The deck is very cool to play and works like a charm vs. most decks that are hot at the moment
The basic idea is to set a trap for him, let them come to you and finish them off with battle cards like you are beaten, put all sections and stuff like that


I will update the strategy section real soon, but I have to go to work.

Just back from work and a meeting, here we go

With the insane high destinies in this deck you should not be afraid of taking on characters. Put Vader at the death star docking bay and set your destinies up and look for your battle and duel cards. Protect the holotheatre with a character if you think an (undercover) spy is going to cancel visage.

I will write some strategy about how to defeat non-interactive decks first, then I will do the same for interactive decks.

Non-interactive decks

Set up search and destroy using the 2 docking bays, if you think your opponent isn't playing mains at all you can bring Vader to the meditation chamber This works especially nice against all those hidden base decks, substract 2 from each destiny draw and Vader can add his destiny to draw battle destiny (Sweet with bossk in bus)
Search and destroy combined with Visage damage, is usually enough to kill the deck. If they cancel visage with transmission terminated get a new one with either t'wilek advisor or by analysing your reserve deck with crush or IAO to look for visage in force pile
Be careful with your ships as you need them to probe

Training decks will also have difficulty with search and destroy and visage, use it's worse if they play it could be worse (even if they cancel it's worse they will be more careful with their next it could be worse)

Interactive decks

It is risky I know but is a lot of fun to set up for your duel. Just be patient and wait for either great tracked destinies or using cards like disarmed and put all sections on alert to gain the edge in duels
