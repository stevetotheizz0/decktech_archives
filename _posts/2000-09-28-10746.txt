Ok a few things before i go into description

When you flip you can pull a card every turn so don’t give me bad reviews about not having a card when you need it, if your smart you will.  If they alter overseeing it personally it goes back to reserve deck and you can get it back next turn.  Common sense here.

Matchups all pre-jpotsd

Profit tough matchup, set up drains fast use ig and bubo to mess with han a bit. drain from top of reserve with mosep, basically stay on raltiir and drain

Throne room varients set up asap and drain drain drain.  don’t leave your guys weak at sites put them together and make sure they can stick up for themselves

speeders crossfire nuff said

mwyhl tough matchup drain from the top to screw up their destiny tracking and play broken concentration to screw them up, also play search destroy.  tough game but winnable.

everything else drain drain drain and don’t get beaten up

good luck with it until jpotsd comes out )
