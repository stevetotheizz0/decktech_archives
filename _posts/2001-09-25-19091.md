description: Well its your typical LS tat deck with madine/geezum going to pull all sites from
the deck. For those of you who arent good at math, that equals a lot of activation.

Strategy: 

Well it’s not that complicated, but here goes: 

use strike planning to pull han and madine before you activate, before they do anything on THEIR turn. as soon as you have 6 force(max 2 turns), deploy geezum, madine, and shimi (via slave quarters). If you have enough force, you can dump threepio at some other location to start tracking magic. 
 use geezum every turn until all locations are out, Insurrection pulls DB first turn. plus, there is a pretty decent chance that you will get a site in your starting hand.

 BATTLEBATTLEBATTLEdrainBATTLEBATTLEBATTLE (phew) until the opponent has no, I repeat, NO characters anywhere within 376,492 parsecs of tatooine. 

Han and Chewie are pretty much a given to have out, han pulled by Strike Planning and chewie by madine by strike Planning. The camp protects against mara (a little) and slows down things like ISB mobpoints,etc... 
Sense and alter since I have so many high ability characters destiny is decently high, but not so high that sense and alter will fail 

barrier is useful, even in a beatdown deck 

with a gift, artoo + threepio, and shimi, there is a possibility to subtract up to 4 from EACH of their battle destinies on tatooine, which is pretty much where they
stay anyways. Well, that certainly helps against the battle section of Ralops, doesn’t it? 
Speaking of ralops, (and ISB, all the like) Underworld contacts helps to preserve my drains. 
contacts also keeps my tat sites on top of theirs 

Losing Track + jar Jar + BM munchen = much pain and suffering and laughter 

the padawan man is always a nice card to bounce around 

Inconsequential barriers is nice to cancel several annoying cards like NSP 

there are many ways to mess with battle destinies 
skywalkers 
gift of the mentor 
protector 
smoke screen 
chewie w/ balster 
leia w/ blaster 
gen han 
shimi 
artoo + threepio 
A gift 
changing the odds 
losing track 
lando w/ axe  

wow that is almost 1/4 of my deck heh 

anyways, You pretty mush wanna battle the heck out of the opponent and drain if if comes down to that (heaven forbid) 
but even draining isn’t that bad, esp with underworld contacts out 

main weaknesses (so far as I can see) are: 
-somewhat slow start, depending on given avtivation) 
-podracing 
-heavy drain decks w/ beatdown protection (not a WHOLE lotta these, though...) 


well I guess that’s all, this is the second deck like this I’ve made, first on tatooine. 

     thx for your reviews
