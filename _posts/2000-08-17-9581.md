Strategy: '

lure your opponent off of Tatooine by draining at the docking bays and when they are weak at the Audience Chamber attack. once you have Han free put him on Home One with the H'nemthe and squish any chars that come up to fight him to keep him safe. This deck uses the meta game to its advantage and will outdrain most other decks and has good s.a.c. defense. '
