Strategy: '

Well, this deck is so straight forward... its almost complicated to describe how it works, hehe.  So I guess I'll do half a walk-through of a simple game.

1st Thing Before your opponent can do anything to you (like while he's activating) use strike planning to get 2 generals.  If you didn't draw any then immediately get Crix Madine and General Solo (simple enough, if you get one of the Generals in your hand, get the other 2 from the deck).  Solo is a monster in this deck, considering the only 2 characters he doens't work with are Kenobi and Madine.  With that out of the way, try to get force, as much as you can so you can get Solo, Madine, and a few other scouts (from your reserve deck compliments of Crix).  Midge of course helps the force drains on Endor, Kensaric provides invaluable protection from a swift rear kick (+2 to deploy for all characters AND vehicles to same site), Beezer stops reacts, the list goes on and on with the nifty abilities you gain from all these scouts.  Luke... well, most of the time your opponent will be forced to come and get him with Vader (Luke (>2 ability scout) + Lightsaber + Proficiency... +3 Force Drain at his site).  Needless you can get some good force draining pretty fast, then Imperial Atrocity combined with Lost In The Wilderness... pick and choose the big force drains to stop or make him lose force to too.  The only other thing to this deck is the hopeful battles... the destiny draws with this deck is phenominal... most of the time 3 battles is pleanty to turn Vader to the Light... tinker around with it, have fun  Thanks again'
