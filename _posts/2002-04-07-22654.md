Strategy: '

sorry about the strangeness of the strategy but something went wrong with the srtat                 



this deck sets up like a well organized drug bust. 

                 on the first turn (force impending)I pull 

                 (and deploy) crix, who pulls his CoK who pulls

                 wuta who pulls a site i can also pull back door and

                 bunker (i get a force because TSID). If i have enough 

                 force which is xtremely doughtful I pull genaral 

                 calrissian who pulls GS1. Anyways Even if I dont

                 do 

                 all those steps I will still have plenty of 

                 activation on turn 2 where I pull more sites 

                 and scouts. by turn 3 or 4 I will be set up for 

                 flip when I flip I send scouts into bunker and use 

                 the +4EE bonus and a charge to blow it away. If

                 the 

                 druggys come to the bunker ill blow them

                 straight 

                 to hell with concussion gernade or a charge.

                 once I 

                 clean out the bunker I spread out in my grace

                 turn 

                 (they have no hand) and drain. the game should

                 be 

                 quick after that because of the force swing and

                 O.K. 

                 drains at Endor. this deck isnt a battling 

                 powerhouse on ground or space but i have good


                 enough forces to maintain what i need to of both


                 places (8 destiny 6and7s help). 

                 Why 3 different AOs? even people on crack can 

                 see that lots of AOs R compatible w/scouts 

                 concentate all fire=scouts immune <6 better 

                 weapond draws 

                 capital support=give enemy capital punishment

                 with 

                 xtra force loss 

                 taking with us=cheaper deploy, harder to hit etc. 




                 Thanks for reviewing this deck 

                 it will beat all druggies (if they R high)
