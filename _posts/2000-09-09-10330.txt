Strategy: '

 the number of interrupts should be 20, not 23 and the character number is 14, not 13.  Swap It's a Trap for Mantellian Savrip, i'm 1 card short, that card should be SomeOne Who Loves You

This deck has been very effective.  It's still in playtesting, but just by the looks of it, YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD.

Why only 2 Massa Lukes and 2 Jedi Lukes?	why not 3-4 MASSAs and 0-1 Jedi Lukes?'
