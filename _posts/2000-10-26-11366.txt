Strategy: '

Set up big drain with super falcon at kessel, and big retrieval with kessel runs, watch out for lateral damage. don’t flip. pull dagoba and then the hut for big activation. pull tant db then have luke and obi kick as s on the ground. with the tunnel visions amass a huge beetdown. if they capture someone via bhbm or hidden weapons then surprise them with captive fury and kick their butt. you can pull the force is strong, add destinies with gift, swing sabers, use lost blaster proficiencies to make their hit characters immediately lost, reduce vader’s power to 0 with glancing blow and exclude someone with clash. This deck is FUN and really good against the all popular BHBM and the soon to be once again popular Huntdown. '
