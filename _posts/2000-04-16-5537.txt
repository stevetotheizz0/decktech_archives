Strategy: 

Oops, Zuxkuss's gun is ment to be Feltipern's gun. sorry for any confusion.

The defualt 'starter' is: CCT, Carbon Chamber, Sec. Tower, Console, ANM, Dengar with gun, Dengar's gun, and the Dungeon. Deploy Dungeon and Audience Chamber on the second turn, giving you a superior activation(at least most of the time) of 7. Now, for the defender part:

VS. Hidden Base: Start Sec Precautions and find their base using your 8 high powered ships.

VS. Ops: Start Battle Plan and use your starships to stall their force drains, maybe using Dengar with gun, Jodo with Snare Rifle, and IG-88 to pick off some of their Operatives.

VS. Mind...: I love this. Use ability3 to make them deploy their maines. Then capture them with Dengar's Gun(or Zuckuss's or IG-88s), and use We're the Bait. Stops Jedi Testing and opponents chances of winning.

VS. Profit: Start with Mara and Jodo, try to get Zukuss's gun on him quick. If they try to use Boussh with Someone Who Loves You, Hutt Smooch Boussh and keep her from seeing Han. If you see Order To Engage, get out of there but make it so they have to keep Lea and Han and Audience Chamber

VS. Throne Room: I love this too. They think they can stop me from activating. I'll show them. They can't deploy their Nudj to my locations. And with starting Crush, I play Evaders on their Revolutions, and bye-bye. I will still be activating plenty(6 on the second turn), and with the 'head-start' of 8 force, I should win handily.

VS. Harvest Choke: Very interesting, but again, not hard to destroy. Capture the Lars familiy, and you're home free.

VS. Endor-Deactivate The Shield Generator: Don't let them blow up Bunker. Get Dengar and Jodo with their guns to Bunker, capture General Solo and his commando gang.

VS. Endor-Ewoks- capture their Ithorians, and then the Ewoks. They have pretty much no way of stopping my force drains, so I should win again.

VS. Tatooine Beatdown(I've actually seen this): Again, go in and capture there dudes. You are gonna be on Tatooine anyway, why not just battle em'.

VS. Blow Up The Death Star(running out of decks): What can  I say, DON'T LET THEM BLOW UP DEATH STAR!!! But if they do, no biggy Use Battle Order to stop their force drains, and force-drain them on the ground to your hearts desire.

VS. Quiet Mining Colony: Go in to Bespin, use Battle Order, capture their guys, the normal stuff.

VS. Cloud City Beatdown with Pucimiir Thryys: Go in and capture Pukey, and force drain them to death.

Remember that the Ability3/We're The Bait combo can be used against every deck. I like capturing weapons because, let's say you capture Luke, but they have another one to deploy. Doesn't matter. I also find that the good capturing combos(i.e. Dengar with Riot Gun) have an easier chance of capturing their mains than you do to 'hit' them using normal weapons. Hope I have a nice deck here, and that you like it.
