Strategy: '

The idea by now is old and very common. This is just my version of it. The first thing you do is win the pod race. I know that sounds vague but that is what you do. Loosing to visage is a gift to you as you can retive the lost force and you make him loose 11 force. there are only 4 vaders in this deck. So it will take you a while to cycle through to find one. To protect visage is holonet transimmison and hutt smooch. One blocks spies and the other stops TT. Masterful move if you lost visage to get one in your hand and throw a 6 back. Counter assault is great with deck. throw a couple of 6 and 5 back and let them cycle and track. When the timing is right for a duel of a counter assult then you ma proced to make the opponent to lose a lot of force. No escape early to block the honor. Even through you have no sites to drain at you just take over one or two sites of the enemy and drain at them. vader and tarkin can hold a site by them selves. mara, dr. evanza, and maul can one. and emporer and his possie can another.


There is just about nothening else that I can think of. It is a staut deck like all the other one’s out there like this.


Thanks for your comments, ideas, and time decktech.
