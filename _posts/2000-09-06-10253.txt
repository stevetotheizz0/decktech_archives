Strategy: '

Well basically this deck uses "Set Your Course For Alderaan/The Ultimate Power In The Universe" to bring out both the death star and alderaan at the begining of the game, and also allows you to take any card with Death star in the title from the reserve deck into your hand, therefor allowing you to fully equip your death star quickly, and  then you can flip the objective as soon as you blow up alderaan, and then you get force drain bonuses at all systems where you have star destroyers'
