Strategy: '

First off, you’re not going for the flip. This is a straight battle deck. If they don’t battle you, drain away.
If you didn’t get Aratech Corp in your opening hand, dump You Cannot Hide Forever and go get it. Also, if you didn’t get Carida in your opening hand, use Mobilization Points to grab that as well. You should have some Scouts and bikes in your opening hand. In this type of tourney, most (if not all) light side players will be playing RST and have the Rebel Landing Site out. This will give you 6 Force on turn 1. Deploy bikes and scouts to the RLS to nullify their game text. If they come down to battle you, ’react’ with Scout Blasters, and an assortment of Interrupts. Game should be over in about 2-3 turns.

Card specifics
Avarik on a bike and Elsek - adds 3 to your battle destiny and covers all attrition and battle damage
Dresolyn & Irol - adds a destiny
Misik - adds to Blaster draw; adds to power when with Barich
Oberk - can capture a missing character (tough to do, but possible though)
Grond - Scout chump
Barich - destiny reducer
Relentless Tracking - make ’em lose Force. Nobody is using Honor Of The Jedi in this format
Don’t Move - Trooper variation of Hidden Weapons
Freeze - instant Perimeter Patrol and a semi-You Are Beaten all in one.
High-Speed Tactics - add a destiny
Hot Pursuit - cancel a react
Pitiful Little Band - add a destiny (and if you can capture a spy of ability < 3, sacrifice them at the Bunker and retrieve double their forfeit.
Sneak Attack - pile on the destiny total

This deck has proved quite good for me, going undefeated in DSII closed tourney play. '
