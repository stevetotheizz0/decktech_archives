update.4----

to Armaedes no offense dude, but sometimes you just have no sense of humour. plus, someone already pointed out the double paste and i put it in an update. and i never been in a game where i couldnt edge. that is all.

end update----


update.3----

to Cantonavader thanks for your generous review and valid objections. re. space, this is a major problem, most fools are good enough to play at least one battleground for me, and thus i think I Hope She’s Alright will make an entrance. re. spies, i use honour to snuff out their drains. re. coward, bomar munk equalizes force icons, he doesnt add drain bonuses...at least, last time i checked...re. Revo, if you see crush, you play one revo, chuck out the grabber and say ’come on btch’. if they hold off, you still get the effect of one, plus theres multiple ways to get it back from lost pile anyways. cheers, mate.

end update----


update.2----

some fool slogged this piece of pure genius with 2.5 cause i didnt have an objective. duh.

for those of you with ratings BELOW 1500, the starting location is schmi’s hut, you pull schmi, you pull 3po, you start winning the game. any questions?


rate me good to replace the frickin 250 points i lost to erase the bad memory of that twit.

end update----


update.1----

oopsie, i think i double pasted the deklist from wordpad...feck. the list finishes beneath quigon’s saber. props to jason ’zwitter’ for pointing that out for me. (sic)

end update----


NOTE shields, i suggest that Aim High, grabber and battle plan number among them. just my take.


okie, so yeah, this is my deck that’s been kicking all the scrubs playing Revenge and Watto in my area. its quite simple, the original idea is from Hayes Hunter’s Brilliant Pile deck his strategy is much more indepth, check it out for the basic premises. i threw in some Revolucions cause


1> its back

2> crush/monnok isnt that good

3> im listening to a lot of Ill Nino lately


along with one blowjob parried (i know its the dark side ver, but it sounds so much better than strike blocked) to counter saber combat, and all that other nasty 5hit that the dark side has, like maul striiiikes, sniperstrike etc.


i chose to retain the shocking grimtassh thing cause


1> merrejek is back

2> its card advantage with 3po

3> a well timed grimtassh never hurt anyone cept your opponent.


i also put in They Win This Round over Vergence in the force, cause i figure if im gonna be on the offensive all the time, i might as well make the most of it.


starting jizz usually includes shock effect, colo and insight, with dont do that again vs mobpoints.


so yeah. thats it pretty much. check out my TR’s to see how its fared for me


rate me nice


cheers,

giles.


UNCONDITIONAL PROPS

hayes hunter for the deck design. it IS brilliant. plus you seem to enjoy my TR’s so yeah, thanks for all the 5s )


PROPS

ronnie wilcox for getting busted. the story behind this card (honor) is that i made some customized cards for 

ronnie (no money, no drugs, no deal) and Ronnie Gets Busted stops the force loss from You’re A Junkie??? so yeah. props to ronnie, plus i didnt mention him much in my last TR.


luca for his schooling on how to play throneroom, which then transferred onto this deck. also for being a sinister manipulator of the galaxy.


ill nino for inspiring me to bring back revolucion with a vengeance, its raped people high and low. plus the cd is really good...think...sepultura x linkin park or something.      '
