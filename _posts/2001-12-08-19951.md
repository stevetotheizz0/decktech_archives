Strategy: '

		Ok so heres the strat


	I havent had the opportunity to play with the deck , so I was hopin some peeps could fill me in where they think I could do better with the strategy. Thanks.


	Destiny Layout 

	0-1

	1-12

	2-4

	3-5

	4-7

	5-10

	6-4

	7-8 


	The destiny layout is pretty good, with 22 cards over destiny 5 . The start is somewhat standard, except with my own little tech in Colo Claw Fish. Right from the word go, slap a 7 on that effect and the first battle your involved in, you get the 7. It may also make the opponent hesitant to make his first battle. Anyway, With Pathetic Lifeform and Insight you can figure that out. Establish a Godd starting drain with Qui Gon and Lando and Yoda. Use Yoda to pull the Sense and Alter, as well as the Control Tunnel Visions, and use Lando to his full ability. EPP Obi and Luke make nice hit and run guys, and Luke can battle when your flipped. 

	Use Threepio to drop your high destiny , recycle your used interrupts. Use cards like Barrier, and It&#8217;s a Trap to keep them off your back until YOUR ready to go, then move around and combat them off your sites. If they decide to ignore you, they&#8217;ll have to eat the drains and that&#8217;s good for you. 


Card Selection


D-Shields 


	There should be a DDTA and maybe another in here, just don&#8217;t have em yet. 


Qui Gon 


	Should play a third JM Qui Gon, I have to substitute for the time being 


TK 422 


	Use him to block drains. 


			The rest in pretty much self explanatory. I know that the strat is weak, but having never played with I was hoping for more input on the part of the reviewers rather than a harsh rating for weak strat. 


Thanks again , hope for some good suggestions.
