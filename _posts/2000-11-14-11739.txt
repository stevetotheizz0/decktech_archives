Strategy: '

***Deck edit*** Dump 1 P o F / or first strike (ur choice) for There is no try.  U need the Sac protection and w/ oppressive, the will be reluctant to sac things... (thanx hayes)
****Deck Edit Again...**** Blast Door Controls, for Emperor, and First Strike for They’ll be hell to pay




This deck plays itself, is fun, and kool to play.  Actvate, get Ad Piet out and get meerjek to pull your systems.  They use the ad orders to drop pilots cheap on your starships.  Ephont Mon is cool, but not reqd so only 1 is in the deck.  Occupy endor to get omnious flowing and then set up and spread.	The deck that gives this deck headaches is The super falcon, enter.... Overwhelmed.  This card is pure Tech.  They have the stacked falcon, drop a destroyer and some pilots (nice and cheap) play overwhelemd and watch their stuff cry to the used pile. (Overwhelmed, LI, DEST 5 during your deploy phase if you have more than dble power that opponent and they have no jedi or starship weapon, send everthing of theirs to the used pile.)  Great in late game chases and in used with Lat Damage.  Outside of that the deck is fighting, and beats.  Use the walkers for forfeit or to control the DB.  Bosk and Zuckuss MUST be in every space deck and thus why they are there.  Ad Chinearu and Omnious with P of F can  push drains up to 6 Thats wack yo.  Now this deck is a bit old school, but still competitive amongst todays meta.  Here are the what to dos against common decks...

vs profit - this is a drain race.  If you want pile your walkers at Tat JP to keep them interior.  Drain race, you should win on your mondo drains and the lack of ultimatum in the meta

vs mains - you will fight in space.  It depends on your speed and destiny trackers.  Use command and Bossk to make a tripple threat of destinies, and IAO provides the forfeit fodder. SOMETHING SPECIAL PLANNED will end their retrieval engines and its +2 force to move away form your big @#$% ships.  Tech  Your drains should overwhelm them

vs EBO - a fun matchup.  You will both be beating the hell out of each other in space.	Get there early (most mains ebo decks run 2-4 ships) and beat them down  Dont forget to make them loose 1 if you have a General or Commander on the ground w/ your AO.  Protect Chinerau and make sure you are drainning along with your opponent.  Dont be afraid to fight, you can handle their space.  And dont forget, OVERWHELMED

All in all, its a fun big blue deck thats fast and effective.  You can win any drain race, with multiple drains for 6 and 5 a piece...

Any comments or qestions, D-mail me before giving me an underservably bad rating...

And before I get any crap, just try it.  Big Blue never felt this good
