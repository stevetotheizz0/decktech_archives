Strategy:

This deck has the main Dark Jedis or Force-sensitive Characters which are used in combination with their sabers to cut down the opposition. Besides the Lightsabers being weapons, they add 1 to force drains, which can really hurt the Light Side if they leave the draining to go on.

If they come to tatooine or if their deck is based on Tatooine and they have Luke or Obi-Wan out, they are in danger of being cut up. After they are chopped up or placed out of play or crossed over with Epic Duel, then the Lightsabers drain on Tatooine like there is no Tommorow.

The Emporer was added to this deck not as a main line in this deck, bu as a bonus, he gives you one extra activation, which can sometimes mean alot in the beginning of some games, to go from five to six or from four to five is very useful.

I threw in a few maul Strikes to pull lightsabers and Weapon levitation in case you play against a Lightsaber Jedi deck 

This deck holds up against most decks, space decks are probaly not a problem if you keep draining with your sabers and at the Landing Site.

The problem is some decks that are based on the same principle this one is on will definetly become a drain race or someone will attempt to fend of the opponent dark or Light Jedis

Just use sabers and Epic Duels with Mara and Vader to take out Obi-Wan and Luke, while using Empires Back to bring Vader back or tarkin if he goes.

Jabba is not needed to win but his extra activation even for draining for zero at some locations makes him something to throw in and None Shall Pass helps keep him safe at his Palace.

Gammall and some of the other cards are in there for backup, like Xizor and the Destroyer Droid, which could be replaced by Sith Probes for capturing the Queen, which is in this deck, but not a key element.

I played this deck a few time and it held up pretty well, I won seven out of seven games.
