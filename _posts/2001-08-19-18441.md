Strategy 


This deck uses No Money, No Parts, No Deal to do two things  deploy characters for free, and recycle destiny while inflicting force loss.


1st turn, Deploy the Sail Barge and the Passenger Deck(and a docking bay)

2nd turn, Deploy Watto + another character[Ephant Mon], and someone else with ability 4 to Mos Espa. Use the objective to recycle a high destiny.

3rd turn and on, repeat and fortify.


Continually use the objective to take the place of a Reactor Terminal, and make sure the Junkyard and Mos Espa are secure.


A weakness may be in space, however, the small fleet in the deck helps, and Security Precautions + Executor can save the day easily, as can the bounty hunter ships. Executor is nice for a possibly free deploy with the objective.


Against Podracing, the multiple destiny 7’s in the deck should win the race. If not, Secret Plans will hamper it.


This is a fun deck to play, and will generally win the game for you. '
