Strategy: '

Well,this is most defensive deck I have ever played, and to my suprise, one of the best. It is all about control and making your opponent play YOUR game. the only thing that gives me trouble in space is the Super-falcon/order to engage combo,which point man and overwhelmed have pretty much taken away....this is not a begginers deck and if you decide to play it, you have to be careful about when, why, and how much you deploy, as is the case w/ most good decks.You cannot be impatient or play to aggresively, which is often my problem...the undercover and u3po and 5d6 uasually wipe ground losses down to an acceptable level to win the game...Uh, i guess the deck is pretty self explanatory and if you have any questions, please put it in the review and i will try to address them....will add do or do not for tournament '
