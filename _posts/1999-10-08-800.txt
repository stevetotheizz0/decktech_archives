Against JP convert JP.

How to Play:

Against Ops:
Use Harc Seff and Order to Engage. use mains to beat down, and draw there fire to stop ghhk.

Against ISB:
Get Obi to Station ASAP and draw mains quickly. Tunnel Vision will help a lot. They wont be able to stand up to your mains and Order to Engage with Harc Seff.

Against HDADTJ:
If they have duel out, deploy with caution. Try to get anti-dueling cards quickly. High destiny will help, along with Tunnel Vision. Get 2/0 sites out as quick as possible. Spin executor sites, or infiltrate with spies to cancel Visage. You should be able to out battle. Out of Commision could get Vader=GAME OVER...

Against CCT: Use Scrambled Transmission. Out of Commision will stop Special Delivery. Infiltrate with rebels. They normally dont have a huge battle force.

Against Big Blue: Try to get out Battle Order so they come fight you. Spin twix sites to get a drain going. Get the falcon, and other ships to go fight. Landing Claw is a card most DS decks pack counters for ( read: Homing Beacon x2)so i left it out.

This deck is strong, and I think I have shown that.
