Strategy: '

First off This is attempt one at this deck, please send LOTS of constructive critisism as I need help with it.

That being said, I suppose I should look at the list and say stuff about it.

Starting is simple, if your opponent gives you no force, drop the training ground, get test 1 and get Yoda.  Next drop Yoda’s house and throw Daughter out there (getting tests 2 and 3 on opponents and your turn) also toss out Yoda’s house for activation.  You also want to get out Yoda’s Hope and Luke’s Pack at this point.  Time to start testing Leia.
Next turn you should be holding test 4 and 5 by the time you activate, test Leia (should pass test 1 handily).	Search your deck for the Swamp, if the swamp isn’t there, grab the Jungle and put it on the opposite side of the training ground from Yoda’s house.  Place test 2 on the swamp and move to it wherever it is after your opponent moves it.
Next turn you should be able to pass test 2 (I usually get a bad draw at this point... hopefully shouldn’t though).  Fetch the Jungle outta reserve (swamp if Jungle grabbed last turn, Swamp should be between Jungle and Training Ground) and drop test 3 (completed due to the way of things), Place test 4 on the Swamp and move over to it (if you have to).
I find that you should start drawing up at some point, find your Traffic Control and start stacking destiny’s, as I usually fail test 4 the first time (miserably).  Also having Reflection on Leia helps at one point or another (should be able to get it with the signal).  When Leia has finished test 4 you want to place test 5 on the training ground and move to it (then you can get Yoda back home).  Track Artoo in Red 5 for test 5 as it is just the greatest (You really needed to be told that, right?).  At any rate, hopefully this deck will engineer a turn 5-6 flip (that’s what I try for... still need some help).  I will enjoy any feedback people have, I haven’t tested this deck yet.  So I won’t list matchups or anything like that, I will just BEG FOR ADVICE.

Thanks for your time '
