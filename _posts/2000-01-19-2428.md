Strategy: '

The main strategy is patience. I want upgarde my deck to make it more competeitive and would like any advice or help. Your SE will vary depending on the situation. Sometimes BP, others Wise Advice. I play it by ear. Tracking destiny can be done with Traffic Control or Electro-binoculars. A 7 on test 5 is Vital. On the Edge retrevial can be huge. Surprise assualt is deadly in the late game. The key is just getting there. Not every game have I trained all the way. Sometimes adapting to your opponent can make a big diference. I have had struggles with HDADTJ , but 3 TT and a few spies seem to help. Any advice or comments is welcome. Thanks-  '
