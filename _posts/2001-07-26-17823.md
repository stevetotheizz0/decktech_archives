Strategy: '

Pretty typical WYS deck.  I chose more retreival then versatility or Podracing because I thought that it would give me the best chance in case I lost a podrace or I was playing against a Start Your Landing Deck with soo much direct damage.  Not much more to explain, you just have to feel the deck out, play it a few times in friendly games to get the feel for it and to know when you can do certain maneuvers. '
