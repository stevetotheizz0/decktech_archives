Strategy: '

Starting effect is usually Imperial Arrest Order. Change it to Battle Order against Ops (you'll have plenty of force from them and a battleground). Pull the docking bays. You need not fear drawing a zero from then on.

Track your destinies. Find the important effects with Twi'leks; in most games you'll want to pull Crush ASAP. CHYBC can wait. Trust me on this.

Only 2 Counter Assaults? More are a waste. You can deal with most cheesy decks with a tracked few destinies, against mains you should be choking, duelling and using your red like mad.

It's pretty self explanatory. You need to play it well though, so practice. Don't be afraid to use The Dark Path as and when you have to. Better to choke Ben, duel Luke and smack Wedge around than end up failing miserably because you pulled a 1 at the wrong time. But as I said, track all the time if you can. I just know that this is not always possible.

Enjoy the deck. '
