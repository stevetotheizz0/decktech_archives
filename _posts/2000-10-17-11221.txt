Strategy: 

in this deck i can get EBO runing in 3 turns via 
ANSB and echo base garrison. then i deploy large
amounts of B-wings and see if my opponents space is 
of any danger then if it is i can re-enforce my 
fleet with stronger  more expensive deploying ships
like cruisers. I don’t have a large ground force
but my drains in space are big and i have force drain
cancellers and my dead guys can go to backta tank 
return next turn. in space battles i can get alot 
of extra power from EBO, aim high and concentrate 
all fire. i end the game with big drains after my 
opponents fleet is demolished.
reasons why i use: commander luke- hew is a better 
pilot than most lukes, deploy0on R2-D2 in red5
i can pull him from reserve deck. his major default
is he is’nt very strong. Ion cannons- they are very
useful at stoping my opponent from running away,
they are destiny+3 on bombers=ionize then get easy
hit, they defend my bombers against SFS9.3 cannons 
and other guns. Bombers-ion destiny+3, can add pilot
if my opponent uses DS I’ll take the leader.
