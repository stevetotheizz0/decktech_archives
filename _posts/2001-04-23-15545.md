Strategy: '

I believe I got all the apostrophes out. So, it should be an easy read. 


I always liked this objective, but every time I would see someone play it they had very 

few characters and lots of interupts. I love to battle. So, this deck can bring the forces 

and if they dont come to you. You can go to them or hit them with Ability,A,A for 

more damage. Capturing is not required, but if you pull it off once or twice that could 

be the game. 


First turn get out baby Jabba or the Barge and just take the force loss. Its only 1 

force Not a huge deal and will probably be a card retrived anyways. Try and get 

Scum set up right away w/Gailid for the added drains. You can deploy ships from you 

reserve. So, DO IT Battle with them and retrieve them and then pull them out again 

next turn. Pretty basic there. 


Card Explanations

Hutt Smooch to get a spy out of JP or capture them Expand the AC to pull more 

aliens from you reserve. Tired of Ben Kenobi bringing people back to life..battle 

w/him and 4-Lom and eat their soup of Ben or Luke or whomever. Snoova gets to 

capture guys and throw them in the pit. 


Decks


vs. WYS

Set up normal trying to get scum and the Barge. Capture his character and throw them 

in the PIT That should take care of them deploy outside of the Cantina. Throw the 

other guy in the Pit w/the Sarlacc and lots of guys on the Barge laughing to make him 

lose force and you retrieve. That will be 5 for a Raider, 9 for Luke, 6-9 for Han, 6-8 

for Dash, 8-10 for Wedge. Does this sound too good to be true? Nope. Make them 

keep deploying to one site or lose force w/A,A,A. You spread and drain. Go to 

space w/Dengar and another ship. Kill them off. Should be able to keep up. Might be 

a close game if you make a mistake, but you should win.


vs. HB Mains

Find those NSP cards and get those going. Make sure to capture a character and 

throw them in. If they dont come to you. Youre drains w/Gailid, Court Damage, and 

A,A,A should keep them from doing too much. You have one grabber. Grab there 

retrieval card. Should be able to beat this deck.


vs. EBO

Time to see how good you are in space. No Decree means youll have to battle. They 

will let you do anything you want for awhile. So, get JPs working and Court Damage. 

If they dare drop an EPP character. Capture him That will hurt them a TON A,A,A 

might not do too much, but in the beginning it might be huge. Pull ships from reserve 

and fight them in space. Close game, but very winnable.


vs. TRM (neo or old school)

Not a huge deal. Just grab their retrieval card. This will have lots of battles. So, use 

that to your advantage. If you can get the Sarlacc going all the better. Should be a 

interactive game w/your retrieval -edging- them out.


vs. Profit

I usually Start Jabba to get stuff to come down real cheap, and either Snoova or EPP 

Fett. Just keep them out of JP and Han under wraps. Or go with a Jade, Snoova start 

and move out of the AC for a turn later w/Jabba and Fett deploying there. Watch out 

for Sorry about the Mess, OrderToEngage. Should be able to out retrive and cause 

some nice drains in this game with all your characters. You will surely have more than 

them to deploy and beat them out of there. Another good game w/interaction. Should 

be able to win. 


vs. TIGIH

Well, no Vader means no grabbing luke and you dont have the TDB. So, they will 

have to use it to come over. If they are playing Endor scouts. Drop and attack them, 

retrieve, repeat. Capturing Luke is nice w/Jade and then dropping him in the Pit for a 

big 9 OOP..hmm..nice objective now. Still a good game and probably not too much 

interaction. Keep them out of Space as Iâ€™m sure Endor will hit the table. Control 

Endor, drain for free and that should be game. 


Cards considered

This is a deck that I havent played with too much lately. So if you see something not in 

there that could be the reason. I still like bringing it out for fun and Im sure it will see 

some tournament action soon enough.

Guri (I would probably find a slot for her somewhere)

Twilek Advisor (for a total of 2)

Secret Plans (for SURE)

Search and Destroy


Well, thats about the jist of the deck. I hope you can make this fun and interactive 

deck to work for you. Any other questions feel free to email me. 

Thanks for looking
