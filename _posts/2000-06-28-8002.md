This is just your typical EBO deck. The locations
are obvious. Use the docking bay to move characters
to the Hoth system. Hoth and Yavin 4 were picked
because they are both targetable by Haven.

Character selection is also self explanatory.
Commander Evram Lajaie is TECH  Move your ships

Laser Cannons kick major ass      '
