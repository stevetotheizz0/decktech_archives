Strategy: '

Basically you start like any other hunt down deck, except you don't play epic duel, because this deck doesn't focus on dueling.  Starting effect is Crush the Rebellion.	During your turn you take either Evader or I Have You Now from reserve, and you take the one that you don't have in your hand, if you don't have either take the evader.  When you are looking through reserve for this, look to see if there are any vaders in there, if you have one in your hand, then there should be 3 in your reserve deck.  If you only see 2 in your reserve deck, then you know one must be in your reserve deck.  I always do this to keep track of my vaders.  I try to flip my objective quickly.  I use the death star with a bright center to the universe to deal with operative decks.  The tortures are in there to deal with inserts.  If my opponent is using ground, i bring out my assault force of characters to fight him.  I try to get most of my characters at one site and elis helrot them around where need be.	This deck typically wins by big battles.  '
