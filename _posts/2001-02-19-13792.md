update

for the idiot that asked how i could play without jedi luke, youre a moron


also, the signal got removed for another TTerminated/OOC, and i fit the outrider in.. and a shes allright for the tank i believe

            ---------------


Ok, heres the basic strat.. pull H1 docking bay 1st turn and slap madine there, so your activation is pretty good... then it plays similarily to the old throne room deck, it can deploy ben at the tat docking bay or use it shuttle a guy... 


the revised version of this deck has a spaceport docking bay in it.. this is necessary to beat ROps. reviewers take this into account please.


the senses are in there to protect the effects you need (like bacta/savrip), and for a secondary purpose which is... you will NEVER EVER have a bad hand with this deck... if you draw crap, just play recoil in fear... draw a new hand.. this also messes with your opponent, and can catch them off gaurd.. late game, when force piles are low, you can gain a turn by playing it, and theyre forced to react to a totally new situation, while yours has (likely) improved... you can also use this card to help get anti battle cards like its a trap pick up your fallen portal again or something.. its really good...  


the only thing about this deck is that it probably needs shes allright to play vs space (suggestions on what to take out??) and if you see a lot of numbers, put in your insight serves you well.. 


Another Ship or Kessel could help as well... but you can easily get all ur ships out and with the savrip/bacta protected with SAC, ur characters can soak up forfeit...


Vs Huntdown... 

Wreck whatever they put out.. the hardest matchup but with the abscense of SAC they cant really stop you from sensing duels.. and the non-duelling kind just gets wrecked... 


VS BHBM

Win battles... stop him from battling when he tries to win them vs you.. pick your fights and you should win this by either converting his ass or just draining him out


VS ties

Hard matchup.. the space gets ugly but a grabber and sac really hurt... a frozen assets beatdown can end the game..


VS MKOS

Tough game but the ground force in this deck seems almost made to go head to head with it... scum retreival hurts, but tracking/recoiling barriers and sorry about the mess usually stops them from battling.. if they pull the ghhk retreival, play its a trap on the battle, play draw their fire, signal/recoil/play frozen assets... kill lone guy for the easy win... sense stops anything they could use to add a force... plus recoil really messes with this deck... 


Vs CCT

give em anyone you want, then beatdown whatever they have and drain the crap out of them.. pretty simple.. the shocks are in there to stop myoom and you should always have one due to recoil in fear... you can really mess with their plans with that card as well.. but who plays this junk anyway.. 


Vs DS Imp command deck

this is the hardest matchup and the reason for why i think a copy of i hope shes allright should be in here... 


well... suggestions???
