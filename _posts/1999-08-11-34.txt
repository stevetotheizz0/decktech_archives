Strategy: 

The starting cards prevent any force choke your opponent
has in store, which is important because a lot of these
cards are expensive.  You use Arrest Order's search text
to pull out the docking bays. This does 4 things:
a)it gives you activation
b)it allows you trasport between 3 systems
c)it allows you quick drains
d)it allows you to pull of the Decree early (Hoth and Yavin)
With a normal activation of 7 (4 is they're using those nasty sleens)
you shouldn't have any problem deploying at your locations. This deck
is pretty self-sufficent when it comes to draining at it's own locations,
but if you see an opening try to bust out the beatdown on the opponent, using
monnoks to watch out for any surprises.  Pick out your effects accordingly:
*Imperial Decree against Revolution/FD bonus decks (i.e.operatives)
*Secret Plans against retrieval decks.
*Battle Order against decks weak in space or ground (weak in space more likely)
*Come Here You Coward against No Shelter/the lone Asteroid Sanctuary deck you'll see
Security Precautions and the Presences are good for activation, so you'll want them
out for any deck you play.  It's a very simple and effective deck
and always puts up a good fight.
