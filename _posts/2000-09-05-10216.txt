Strategy: 

Start with IAO, Mob Points, and Imperial Decree.  Use IAO to pull out some Docking Bays and control them to get some good generation from Mob Points.  Get the Star Destroyers and Piett out asap to pull out those Probe Droids and get them down.  Control those two Hoth sites to get Imperial Decree going.  Put the Emperor with Renz, Irol, Drelosyn, and Barich to protect him.  Put Overseeing it Personally on Palpatine asap.  Flip the Objective asap ot get some good drains going.  If everything is going right you should draining for 4 at the Endor sites.  If you have to forfeit guys, lose the ISB agents first cause they can be retreived unless you have to flip your objective back.
