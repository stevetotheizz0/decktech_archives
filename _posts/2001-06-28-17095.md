***************UPDATE*******************

Due to a review I found it  necessary to include this.  I do not play with vader ON PURPOSE  I don’t want to run the  risk of cathcing Luke then losing force every turn.  M’iiyoom Onith is KILLER in this deck, I am not taking her out.  If they are about to deploy Jedi Luke she  kils him  That is too powerful.  I am not planning to ever put Vader in this deck.


************** END UPDATE*****************




Right off the bat, this deck probably looks like a piece of weall know what, but once you give it a try it is actually pretty decent.  Use BHBM as the platform for a couple of reasons 1)You can deploy Palpy (destiny 6) from deck on first turn 2) most people wouldnt expect  a BHBM deck to be totally non-interactive.  Podracing helps this deck in a few big ways.  Of course you get a 22 card swing if you win- which is most of the time with all the high destiny in the deck as well as the Podracer Collisions.  And it forces the opponent to keep drawing destiny bring your insert closer to the top.  


Your characters Destiny total is 15, while most decks out there today for the LS are lucky to have 10.  So usually you will make them lose 5 force per insert.  Some decks will just only deploy a few characters then attempt to force drain you to death.  Well, easy enough- just Counter Assault them.  Once You have your ships in hand as well as your sites out, the destiny in this deck is just a beast.  You can CA them for up to 10 force.  If your meta is like mine, most LS decks will pack maybe even just one It Could Be  Worse to stop mainly the podrace loss.  Then you play It’s Worse and the are screwed.  Because you really don’t deploy much at all you can put a lot of force into It’s Worse.  


I realize I dont have a lot of force to generate, but I simply don’t need it.  The ships are for late game drains after they lost their ships, or a surprise beatdown.  You have to simply save force and it wil be a non issue.  Probably every LS deck in todays game will give you at least some force too.  


Just a  few small tech items

M’iiyoom  big shock here, if you cant deploy your people you get screwed from my inserts.


Abyss If you draw for anything (podracing, training, etc. ) this card ca wreck you if you are playing mains  and toys.  


Imbalance  Destiny 4 used interrupt.  You finally saced enough force to retrieve say 10 force, well know you lose 5 of it right back


That is pretty much the whole deck, more than being the best deck ever this deck relies on a few litle surprises.  Have  fun and give suggestions if you could.  Thanks
