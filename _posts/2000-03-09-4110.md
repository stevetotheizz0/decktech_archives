Strategy: '

Okay for starters *READ THIS* and please leave a detailed reveiw. I haven't bought much EJP or ECC.


Okay here's how to start

VS. All. On The first turn use the console to get everything you need to freeze. If you don't have a bounty hunter in your hand (though unlikely it's possible) use Double Back to grab one. You Should be able to get at least 8 before destiny then it's a peice of cake to freeze. Just freeze their Guy ASAP. If they don't give you a rebel all the better then just concentrate on beating thekm down. Try to keep all the combo people together (i.e Vader/GMT, Boelo/Jabba, and 4-LOM/Zuckuss or Jabba).

VS. Operatives Start Battle Order. To make them pay to drain. Then try to get ABCTU out and target their planet. Also Invade Their Planet w/ combos of Zuckuss and 4-lom or Vader and Tarkin.
If you can think of any DS card that reduces attrition please tell me, cause that would be great.

VS. Hidden Base. Start Security Precautions. Wait till they flip then deploy and probe like Heck. Try to keep most of your ships together unless their forces are spread out real thin. Put Ugnaughts and bounty hunters you don't need as passengers for forfeit fodder while you use Vader to kill what ground the do have.

VS. Mains or MWYHL. Start Bad feeling and use the twi'lek's to grab All wrapped up ASAP, Then if you are able to get to them capture all their mains. If you're real lucky they won't have any non main rebels.

VS. Rescue The Princess
Don't laugh I acttually played one of these. Forget the guy they give you and take the princess then they can't flip and get their other stuff out.

Here's a little extra info about the deck
Idealy you want to use both carbon freezings. I have stuff in this deck to counter most types of decks. Vesden, Torture, Securit Precautions, Bad Feeling have I, ABCTU, There'll be Hell to pay, Battle Order, and Monnok. I feel that this deck is pretty well balanced. Please tell me what you think.

This deck is very straight-forward. Again Please make your reveiw Constructive. If you can't think of more than 'you need to improve this deck' or something like that then please don't reveiw this deck.
