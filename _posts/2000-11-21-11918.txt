Strategy: '

Deck Edit**********************’
Ok with Test 1 (I forgot...duh) Pull the Chimera and add in Broken Concentration

Pull a Walker Garrison and add in Failure at The Cave
Pull an Imperial Walker and add in a Dagobah Cave

End Deck Edit*******************

Some responses
Hunter Fett....ever hear of DLots?  That is Darth Vaders nickname, sorry if you didnt know it.	That would be Vader and that would be me not losing force.  Esp after adding in failure and broken.

Jawa Tosser....I start There Is No Try...If they sence all 5 (4 now) Garrisons thats 12 force they lost...and if Oppressive is out I get the garrison back...read the cards

This is why I wanted people to give some input but READ THE F”N CARDS.

************************
Ok, nothing against Brian Hunter about never posting a deck unless its undefeated but I am posting this deck as an unplayed version that I am looking for some critisism.  Obviously Grimtaash might be a problem which I am looking to change maybe.  Then again all decks are just meta and playing without Grimmy protection is like playing without deuling protection for the LS.	Not much Grimmy played here so no sweat for now.

The premise of the deck is to set up power with walkers then drop the RBO and AO to get a direct damage going against decks that can shut down my Garrison drains.

With Mod Points I am guarenteed a fast start ala DBs and Rendili.  Using that and the ability to drop everything cheaper at the mountains and spread quickly for garrison damage.

Ok some reasons for certain cards (sorry if some were obvious...just talking to myself here ;)

YCHF - Stops odds, Resistance isnt needed for the dual purpose of odds/drains cause of the TTMG and it can pull ENO.

ENO - Even if it only works a few times in the game it is worth it methinks.  Especially with Chadra Fans coming out big. Probably card 1 that I would pull but for now I like it, a meta thing.

WIAPN - Thought this AO would be better cause of the amount of DD that this and RBO can cause with Presence

Why 2 Mountains? - Well the ability to move for free and -1 deploy is key to the deck by getting clunky walkers out cheaper.

Against most decks, you need to just play your game by holding Hoth and getting the drains and DD to hurt the opponent.  Against EBO draw for TTPG and At-At Cannon to blow it away then drain like a fool after you get battlegrounds again since the shield it gone.

Have fun with it.	'
