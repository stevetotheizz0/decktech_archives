About this deck: 

This RST deck is using the new booster effect from the tatooine site, I have been using this deck for a 
long time, unflipping but now Ive modified it to blow the bunker but without conceiding too much cards 
for it.

YES, this deck ressemble a lot the REBEL STRIKE TEAM DONE RIGHT by BRIAN HUNTER, I dont intend 
to steal his idea or anything his somewhat old version is near perfect and the one I used was very 
similar to his, but now I feel that with RII and the new effect it has some signifiant changes in 
strategy to post the deck here, well I hope you have time to read the lil novel I am about to 
write. ^.^

Explanation about card choices: 

Why not 2 jedi knights? well I play often against BHBM decks and when I notice that he is using 
the VADER machine to wreak avoc, I simply pull the rebel scout to remove vader from ground and 
have him lose 1 force each turn till the end of the game.

Why a old Obi-wan? whitout his lightsaber? Easy, this ben is used for beatdown when the opponent 
has an Endor Operations using biker scout, havent figured it out yet? just toss away one easy 
biker scout in a battle to an adjacent site to make him lose 5 power and sometime his battle destiny 
and then you can kick the scout to the adjacent site if he hasnt chosed to lose it, this is some 
serious tech to use even if it isnt that underground, everyone love ben!

There are also lot of cards (Proj of Skywalker, Lost in the wilderness, battle plan, 
menace fades, ...) used to kill the drain on other planet to force the opponent to come battle you 
and get their @#$% kicked.

Throw me another charge: get your devices, add to the blowing and a 6 made for tracking!

Ill take the leader: Your hardest thing to do in this deck is occupy the endor system to keep
your objective flipped and make Close air support work like a shine, so this help your starships
stay by enhancing their immunity and also help against these damn tie swarm decks.

Insertion planning: another 6 made for tracking and it also helps a great deal to make your
characters stay alive... flip your objective and have an insertion planning: nothing except a 7
can make a character leave table (except weapons) but heh, forfeit an ability 2 scout and retrieve
him at the end of the round.

How to play:

Ok, the basic game, you start with SQUADRON ASSIGMENTS, STRIKE PLANNING and THE SHIELD IS DOWN. 
First turn you activate 6 forces and give 1 to the opponent (so you usualy activate 7-8 or more 
forces on turn 1) You may then chose either to go one with Madine + Kensaric on the landing site 
AND lando in GS1 on ENDOR or fortify the ground. Then its up to you to fortify ENDOR (the system) 
which is your centerpiece here and its realy hard to do against tie swarn and such, Ill never say 
it enought ENDOR SYSTEM IS YOUR WEAKNESS! So just make sure you fortify it with every ship youve got 
and make good use of the drain stoppers and Close air support to lure your opponent to a total beatdown 
on endor. Even if this deck was made to drain (MIDGE!) I think the potential is more in a beatdown, just
have General solo, a Jedi luke, run luke run and dont get @#$%y and with close air support you will
wreak avoc on endor!

If he doesnt want to come? well just get out Beezer and Junkin out (well with some other peeps for 
defense) in the bunker and blow it to piece, it is usualy taking 2 turns, 3 at worse, then its 
retrieving time and the opponent lose 8 forces + hand to used pile, this is HUGE, then just outdrain
him ^.^

Ok, this is nice but how to blow the bunker efficiently? Well blowing the bunker must not be your
main goal, since it can leave you defensless. Just try to do it if you know, more or less, that your
opponent beatdown potential has diminued drasticly or that you have flipped your obj and have everything
in hand to to it in 1 shot (which mean dropping the charges and have a least a single character staying
alive if your opponent comes.

Ok, now that you have the idea how the deck plays here are some of the strategy I use against some typical
decks:

Bring him before me: this one is easy if it is the standard big characters with power deck, since you usualy
win most battles when he comes to battle you and since BHBM has no drain potential at all, you have no fear
to lose. 

Ralltiir Operations: this one is easy too, since the biggest advantage of Ralltiir is to make your drain -1,
when you flip, he cant modify them so theyll have to come to stop your drain and just beat em.

Endor Operations: humm... not realy hard since you just overcome your opponent one his own ground since it is
also yours, but beware you must keep occupying the system at all cost, FEAR the ties!!!

Tie swarm deck: this one is your thoughest matchup, since they can easily make you go away from the system,
lot of them have weapons and these damn all power to weapons, just play carefully and you can win, in fact
you can sacrifice flipping and playing in the air not to get outbeaten, just blow the bunker and try a 1 turn
beatdown with your ship (since hell have no hand).

HD: well huntdown is not realy popular here, I havent realy gotten trought hard HD matchup, but like Brian
Hunter would say: LET VADER HAVE HIS SITE!

Court/scum cum: well this is another hard matchup, but wait not anymore? Ive thought that removing force drain
bonuses with menace fades was MODIFYING the opponent force drain, but nope, check the new CRD menace fades work
even with hutt influence in action, so this isnt much of a problem just think carefully not to let the opponent
come with his damn skrillin swarn kick your not so defended site. But usualy while thinking right and having
close air support and some other battling cards like run luke run, dont get @#$%y and insertion plannings,
thing should go allright.


Carbon Chamber testing: this one is also tricky because they usualy remove 2 of your generals: solo and lando.
So play carefully, not 2 of these decks are alike.

Also for the cards I would like to be added in there:

- Rebel Leadership: solo, lando and madine just got better
- more barriers and stuff against these pesky you are beaten, maybe some senses, I dont know, lot of things
  can be useful, you just have to adapt to the META in your region.
- Anakin Podracer to defense yourself against podrace, but even then, this usualy isn’t enought against a prepared podrace deck.

To conclude, please donT bach this deck if I made mistake, just write it in your constructive review, I am
not omniscient and I can forget things up so just gently point them up please! ^.^ 

Well if you are here you must be very patient, addicted or have lot of time on hands, well I thank you to
have checked the whole thing and I hope youll impartialy judge this deck and help me with constructive
reviews.

NB: Im sorry for all the typos, grammar faults and everything else, I am not willing to crosscheck it as I
would do with a final essay test. Thanks
