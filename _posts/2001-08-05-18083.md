Do, Or Do Not & Wise Advice '

Strategy: '

Numerous changes have been made to the deck in response to the requests made by reviewers.


Turn 1- Deploy Corellia Or Kessel From deck. If you can, drop threepio to use his text. Hold smugglers in hand until you can get two at a site. If you play a ship and pilot remember to use the pilots text as well (specifically Mirax).


Turn 2- Pull the last remaining system in your deck and deplpoy. Opponent should be getting the start of a good force going now. You should be able to deploy your two smugglers from hand to your site and flip. Hopefully you have Han Or Chewie with Talon.


Turn 3- It all Starts to happen now. Opponent will more than likely begin bringing the fight to you now. Fortify a location and heavily utilize the game text of your admirals order.


From this point on you should be able to deal with most threats as they occur. I will now discuss individual card choices in the deck. This is in response to the number of people wanting to know why I built the deck the way that I did.


Out Of Somewhere-It’s a fun card in this deck. "Well darn I don’t have another smuggler at the cantina," and my opponent drops Darth Vader there and battles. "Oh what’s this? Out Of Somewhere? Chewie to go with Han from the reserve deck?" Well that takes care of that. "While your at it add It’s Not My Fault and Wookie Strangle."


Landing Claw- Order To Engage. Direct damage baby


Mercenary Armor- Big bonus in this deck to get power +3, armor 4, and Immunity less than 3 It’s just swinging with the Blasters. Bam Draw a 3 for free and Blaster Prof. It for good measure. Plus most of the destinies are more than three, so you’ll be taking out some dark jedi just for kicks. There’s just way too many cool things to say about the armor


A Few Manuevers- Want to get that Kessel Run done really fast? Here you go then. Plus TIEs with SFS 9.3 are a lot easier to beat with it since you get to keep your ship on the table more often.


Intruder Missile- Why you ask? It plays on 4 of your 5 ships. Recirculates it self back into your deck by using it, and is DESTINY 7 Very cool.


Why so many of the same admirals order?- Well thats a good question... answer? Destiny 6, it kicks butt in this deck, and destny 6 It pretty much works better than more interrupts.


Fire Extinguisher?- Why 2 of them? It cancels battles, Lateral Damage, and Ion Cannon effects.Using this card opens a big ol’ can on your opponents hinnie. Plus it’s  a destiny of 5.


Quad Laser Cannon- Shoots things. Duh.


Wookie Strangle- SOOOO much fun to use. And because there’s 2 of them you get to use them 4 times when your flipped.
