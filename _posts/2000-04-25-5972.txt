Strategy: 

(some of the hunters above I accidently put ECC instead of EJP.)
NOTE: SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL NOT GETTING THIS, I CAN START OUT WITH DAGOBAH CAVE AND THE OTHER GENERICS. The text states: If you have not deployed an Objective (Which I didn't), deploy from reserve deck one battleground site(OR TWO <> SITES) related to your starting location. This means I can deploy the two sites with the cave. IF I COULDN'T DO THIS, THEN LS THRONE ROOM COULDN'T EITHER, THE THRONE ROOM ISN'T A BATTLEGROUND ALSO!

Ok, Well you start off like the regular LS throne room deck, then you wait for them to deploy something and beat them up. If they revo your cave, use twi'leks to get out crush the rebellion then evader their revo. Bad Feeling Have I and Wrong Turn are great against EPP squads. All EPPs and all main characters are deploy +3! Thats 12 extra force just to deploy all four EPPS!!!! You should have enough senses to stop alters, plus oppressive lets you put bad feeling back into reserve if they alter it and  to be taken out again with twi'lek. The scanning crews are for getting rid of people like obi and luke, so you can beat up on han and leia. The Character count and choice of characters should keep you alive too. The Evazans, Disarmeds, and weapons should let you get rid of most of there characters, then beat up whats left of the measly rebel scum.  Anyway, I did not copy this idea from anyone, I thought of it the other day. I know villageidiots deck is almost identical to this one in some ways. But geuss what, e was just posting that deck for me to get reviews for when I posted that, plus he needed to become active. Well thanks for the reviews.
