Strategy: '

*Ounee Ta - Just in case they use a <> site, that would be VERY funny hehehe eloms for free, quick game i would say mea hahaha

*General Crix Madine - pulls Beezer

*Corporal Beezer - Pulls a Device

*ASP-707 - Put them at same site as beezer ( Home one maybe) and put you portable scanners back on top of deck mwa hahaha

*Portable Scanner - Destiny 6, pulls a device...emm.... oh yeah deploy on rebel

*On The Edge - Portable Scanner and ASP then play this 8-D

*Lost In The Wilderness - lots of fun



"""""""""""""""""""""""""

     To play this deck is simple, beat the crap out of your oponenst 3 times then cross vader with ASP and portable scanner and electro binoculars hehehe 8-D. Possibly put in some SAC stuff... i dont really need it though 8-D. My 1 card which i swap in and out in testing is Do Or, Do Not.
     Please let me know what would help -D '
