Strategy: 

This deck is only played in fun games. I think I have to exchange some cards to make it 'tournament legal'...
There are some general ideas to deal with:
1. Choose your SL wisely. With Port ... District you have an early drain with Lando (power=4 for one force). The Casino can be useful for the force activation and retrieval.
2. At the beginning of each turn, look for your Shocking Rev. and count your mains, locations, starships etc, - whatever you need.
3. Use your mains like in a Hunt Down Deck.
4. There are soooo many different interrupts which are all worth to stack for Light Side:
Ellis, Sabbacc, Tallon Roll, the used 5`s and 6`s, barrier and maybe Sense and Alter.
5. The Obsidians at CC with the tallon roll are very strong. They can even kill th super falcon.
6. Sabacc is tech. Play it at every time, exspecially in the opponent`s activation phase or in the weapon phase in a battle. Not the retrieval is the best thing, in the end game the opponent sometimes has no destiny for battle or duel.
7. Circulate your high destinies and use them for a battle or perfect sabacc.
8. Remember, it`s only a fun deck...
