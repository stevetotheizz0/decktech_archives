Strategy: '

In game in which your opponent starts with out an Objective, start with Obi-1's Hut and Tosche Station.  Get Obi-1 or Master Luke to the station for the force generation.  Then use rest of the main characters to their full potential and go beat down their guys.  Good pairs are Chewbacca Of Kash. and General Han with the ability to cancle one battle destiny, General Solo and Leia with Blaster. Lando With toy and Tawss Khaa on C.C.  There are more combos than that.  As well keep up the force drains.  Be carful in space but you have good ships.  Use Oola to remove there Unique guys from hand.

Vs. Big Blue. Be carful were you put your guys. Try the inside sits to prevent the wakers.  When out side watch you back by having some guys in your had.  Try to stay out of space, only go if you know you will live.

Vs. Hunt Down.	Try to get the Bothan Spy to Vis. and stop it.	Our use Neb Leads if they don't use Imp.Ar.Orders.  Then be careful with your Jedi, only go near Vader if you have Courage Of a Skywalker in your hand.

Vs. Operatives.  Start with Hut and Battle Plan.  Try to slow down the drains.	Use Obi-1 Kenobi text to make the Op. move to.	Try to prevent the fip, if not force drain at all the locations that allow a force drain of two, all except 3.

It shouldn't be too had to win, don't give up because your guys just keep coming back. '
