***********UPDATE #2***********************
OK,  First never in my weirdest dreams did I think I would be the 7th rated deck on Decktech, so for all those people that this this is a good deck, thanks.  Now for some responces.  I had the Rancor Pit in there but I am going to take it out for Search and Destroy.  Search is a better card, since it is not a destiny 0, and I was worried about Activation, and now having played it I am content with the Activation.  In response to the revert to regular Dr. Evzan . . . I have run it both ways and I like this combo better, as it is better for a one turn sacrifice crew.  Anyway, as far as Other additions, (Mara Jade) Hey my destinys are low enough as it is, so I fear making them any lower.  I have on occasion drawn 3 destineys and gotten a total of 5.  So, no on another Mara Jade.  She is useful, but I think the Arica is a better match for my deck, being that she deploys undercover.  And then I can break cover when it is opportune to do so and kill that pesky Jedi Luke, where as the Dr. Evzan method is too succeptable to Chewbacca, Protector.  As far as the Combo card Ghhhk, NOT a chance.  I can’t get it with Masterful Move, it is not that useful otherwise, and I can cancel Sunsdown for those annoying WYS decks.  Again, Thanks for the good reviews.
***************END UPDATE #2*****************

****************UPDATE*********************
OK, for those doubters that think I cant take a drain of 8 a turn from Hidden Base.  Think again.  They drain me for 8, I hit them for 1 then 6 non-cancelable drain off the top
Drop Zuckass or Stinger or something to battle, retreive.  So late in the game I am losing a net of 5 (or 4) and they are losing 8 (or 9)  This is better for me.  Even if I dont get to iniate I am destroying their reserve deck with my drains, where I can control, or lose from hand their drains.  I am in a far superior position from a Hidden BAse deck.
*********END UPDATE*************************

OK, this deck is solid and can be used to win with a mediocre player.  (My rating is 1530, and I have been playing for 6 months)  I beat opponenets that have been playing longer and are better than I at SWCCG.  This is the basics of the deck.  In tournament play this deck went 3-0 with a +72 diff.  That may seem small to all those world class champions out there, but to me that is solid.	Some reasons for some cards.

Oota Goota:  In our local area everyone is using the new objective.  This can become very annoyng to them.
Point Man:  Cancels Order to Engage.  Very simple, no Bo Shuda/OTE combo killing me.
Masterful Move/Ghhhk:  Why no Monnok?  Because I very rarely use it and very few people play Agents or X-wing swarm in my area.  The other is a great card and awesome recyclible 6.
Virago/Stinger:  The ships arent half bad in the first place.  Second, being able to deploy from reserve deck and then plop down their pilot from hand is awesome.  The best cheapest combo in the game right now (IMHO) is Zuckass in MH, Stinger, Guri.  With Skum out it is 6 force to pull off.  Cheap.
CC Engineer:  Profit, plain and simple.  Also read profit strategy below.
Dr. Evazan & Ponda Boba (single card):	I can drop them and now I have a multitude of options before me.  Dengar can come down and kill two people durring the battle (not just hit), Snoova deploys for 1.  (Nothing like some wookie love. =) ) and also The standard sacrifice crew, as long as your opponent doesnt have a shinny stick.

Matchups
I can only give actual mtchups for decks I have played against.  I will give simulated matchups for those that I have not.

Watch Your Step:  Well, I beat 2 good watch your step decks this weekend, and I think they they just cant control the ground and that will hurt them.  Take over the Cantina, and beat them arround.  Jedi Luke is the biggest problem, but if they beat you to the Cantina use Arica to block their drains.  Then break cover one time to kill him once you have her stick.  Or stack a 6 to have Snoova capture Luke.

Hidden Base:  I know what you are thinking, how the heck do I plan on beating Hidden Base.  Well they have to do one of two things.  Come to ground to cancel my drians (or my bonuses with Menace Fades), or (where I get a good chance to beat them and retreive) stay in space and try to out drain me.  I have news for you.  It wont happen.  I will be able to beat down some ships by themselves.  The Guri/Stinger/Zuchass w/MH is too much and you then get to retreive force.  And they will have to lose to my drains off the top of their reserve deck, potentially killing those matching poilot combos.

Other decks, and how I will play them.

Profit:  I start Skum, baby Jabba, and Chall.  This makes all my aliens deploy -3.  I deploy Boelo or Ephant Mon, CC Engineer, and convert their site.	This stops them from pulling BoShuda from reserve if they are trying to do that.  I have 5 battle stoppers in this deck so I should have one in my hand while I stack up the AC and never let them free Han.  Bib will prevent them from moving Han, or Bubo will prevent Han and Leia from moving.  Almost an Auto Win, but dont over deploy, and always save the force to barrier or None Shall Pass them.

EBO:  Well, it is true that I cant compete with a super drain deck like EBO and it all depends on how they play.  I can beat a Deadbolt (I think) because of all the extra deployment costs.  X-wing EBO could be tough, but I think that the drains off the top, and surgical strikes at their ships will win it in the end for me.

I would like constructive advise for how to make this a better deck.  Also are there any glaring weeknesses in it that I may have over looked.	Thanks in advance.
