Strategy: '

Instead of toiling for hours and playtesting your deck to get it to be as good as possible; now you can just roll dice  
The cards in your deck really don’t mean jack, it’s all about the dice now.  


all the dice are interchangeable of course, but you’ll find that you’ll play better if you name your dice and blow hot air on them.  

if you lose a game, you can always sideboard some of your other favorite dice, but stick with these for now.  

guarantee’d to be a sure fire winner.
