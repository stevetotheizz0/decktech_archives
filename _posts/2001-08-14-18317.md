Strategy: '

ack  it really is late.  forgot to list luke’s backpack.    (that should be under green =p)


I have always loved the MWYHL objective, but have, in all my previous decks trained DoS to test 6.  When it worked out it was a beautiful thing, but nowaydays with so many grabbers and anti-retrieval cards in decks that are so fast it makes your head spin, it is hard to play a training deck consistently.  So I made this deck that trains to 3 which makes you insanely powerful in Battles, podraces, which is incredible for the lightside. and is overall, friggin nice.


Early Game

Pull everything that you can with Dagobah and the objective.  There are four ability 4 scrubs to chose from.  throw one down and train them as quick as you can.  Given a little early activation from your opponent and a nice draw, you can have test 3 completed by turn 4.  once you are trained, keep Yoda at his Hut and you are ready to throw the beatdown.  

Podrace like your life depends on it.  There are 3 a step backwards in there to play, and you really don’t need to worry about it getting grabbed (or sensed.  Objective should provide enough SAC protection)  With the insane Destinies and the racing interupts,you should win the race. (I needed to say that since everybody that races says that, right?)

You should have plenty of activation also.  Start throwing down to the arena since no battles will happen.


Mid Game

This will most likely invole the extermination of the darkside from Tatooine.  Your army should be ready to roll, or at least be deployed once you retrieve 10 force from the podracing results.  Go and throw the beatdown with your mains that are now effectively adding 3 to all of their immunity to attrition with Yoda at his hut and test 3.  Just to show how sweet this is for example, darkside needs to draw a 10 with a saber to hit Qui-Gon.  The only two charaters originally without immunity were the EPPs, and now the DS must draw a 3 just to make you have to lose them.  And the other characters?  They had better hope they have plenty of destiny adders.  Also, you should be able to hit plenty with your weapons with the good destiny of the deck.


Late Game

By now the DS should be running for their lives and you should be able to control Tatooine, set up the party, be retrieving for I did it, and helping your differential.  Kill them quickly with the cantina shuffle (possibly courtesy of the battleground signal) or whatever other drains you need to do.


Since I love talking more than i need to, i will go into some card explanations...


eh, forget it.  it is late as h.ell.  i’ll just wrap up by saying this deck has everything.  Huge activation (can pull just about all the sites), drain capability, insane battling ability, infinite retrieval, and direct damage.  oh wait, no it doesn’t.  cr.ap, i lied.  anyway, i still think it is a winner.  rate as you will, but D-mail me if you want also.  any questions or something you want to suggest that you just want to let me in on.
