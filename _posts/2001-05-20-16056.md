Strategy: '

OK this deck is cool and I like playing it so remember that.


Response to reviews

I do have retrieval (the Nar Shaddaa chimes) i know its not much, but its still something

mebbe on or off the edge..............but i don’t got either

also, it IS mara, cuz she and talon start a smugglers organization in the books....and it looks nothing like mirax


Card Choices


Master Luke??? Probally cuz I only have 1 Jedi Luke and also I wanna bounce pepl. Against Scum its master and against BHBM or Hunt Down its Jedi.


No Lando??? Well I just couldn’t find a Lando that goes in when making this deck so I just put in Lando in ship.


Kessel??? DUH anything that you can pull that is drain of three is worth putting in.


Local Defense??? This card is DA BOMB Pulls Outrider which pulls dash....Put a freighter captain on it and put at Kessel for drain of 3.


Artoo, I Have A Bad Feeling About This??? This is about the best card in SWCCG. Can be pulled with Artoo & Threepio (which I REALLY need another of) to cancel ALL of their destinies. Vader alone at a site with them holding I Have You Now??? No problemo, just drop Chewie, Han and Artoo and Threepio and you’ve got vader down for the count (play OOC and get vader, now hes gone forever)




Matchups

Hunt Down VERY TOUGH. I lost by 25 to the state champion’s hunt down battle. It was NOT cool. Dueling hunt down is a lot easier because I can just hold the cantina with Freighter Captains and mebbe han or sumpthin and drain at kessel. Don’t deploy Luke unless you are SURE they can’t get to him. Mebbe let them duel Jedi Luke, cuz its minus 3 for them. Cancel Visage with TT and beat them up with scrub smugglers.



Most ground decks are tough and Space decks are easier. I can make planned attacks on weak systems and drain a lot on the ground. When they come to battle me, I can make game winning battles to win. 


Thats about it, any questions, just feel free to ask.   '
