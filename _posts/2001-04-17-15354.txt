Strategy: '

To start the game off, deploy the Coruscant Docking Bay, and get someone there for extra activation.  Pull your docking bays every turn. As soon as you get an Imperial Command, pull Piett, and put him on the Executor Docking Bay and use him to pull Commander Meerjk.  Use Meerjk to pull the hoth system.  Try to search your reserve deck to see if your sites are in your force pile and get your sites out, if you can get them out fast and drop your walkers and play walker garrison, the game is yours.  Try to get Emperor Palpatine over to Hoth and give him Overseeing it Personally.  When you get and deploy Chall Bekan, use him to pull the ORS.  

Drains will be +1 with OIP, +1 cuz of ESA, +2 with Walker Garrison, and maybe +1 somewhere with Veder and his Saber.  Get mosep in the middle of it and they will be hurtin If you Play smart, you can win.

Use the ice storms to protect the walkers, if you get presence of the force, drop it out somewhere and put an agent on a walker with the ice storm sittin there.  It would be better to play the ice storm with surprise and jump the opponent if he deploys. 

If you can get Major Marquand and Lieutenant Watts out and together on a blizzard walker, they can hold a site easily
They are a DEPLOY - 10, POWER - 12, FORFEIT - 17 and immune to attrition <4 with 2 battle destinies

MATCHUPS
VS. Profit Start Chall Bekan and the Outer Rim Scout in the Audience Chamber... NOT  Dont start anything, just stick to your gameplan, drop 5D6 on tatooine and they will be hurtin, but watch out for the Artoo and Threepio combo, if they battle and kill 5D6, just retreive him and try to re-deploy him. Stick to hoth and play the walker garrison and they wont be able to keep up with your drains. 

VS. EBO you have a very good chance here, youre already on Hoth and their ground will probably be weak, just deploy and spread out, then march into the base and its over for them (my first ISB deck actually used TARGET THE MAIN GENERATORS, and i blew them up, but that was a long time ago)  As before, just stick to your gameplan, only dont got to space unless you want a whoopin

VS. RST (blowing bunker) - as soona s they deploy the bunker, start to deploy everyone you can Pile em up there, so they cant get control of it, if you can flip, then just sit there and hold the bunker.  If you cna get a presence of the force, drop it on the bunker to make it a battleground.  Flip the objective, hold the bunker and they cannot drain on ENDOR (their objective says they cannot drain for more than 1 and your objective makes their drains -1).  Flip, and hold the bunker and the game will be yours.
If they arent blowing the bunker just stick to your gameplan.

Vs. WYS - I havent had a chance to play this deck yet, so im not exactly sure how ISB will hold against it, so Ill Update this as soon as i Play WYS

Those are the most popular decks in my are right now, so i havent really gotten to play anything else.

NOTE As soon as i can get a REBEL BASE OCCUPATION, i will put it in here for a little more direct damage.  

Please, only constructive criticism, THANK YOU
