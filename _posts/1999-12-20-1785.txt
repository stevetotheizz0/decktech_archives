This Deal is Getting Worse All the Time/
Pray i Don't Alter It Any Further







Strategy: 

This deck is pretty good against most decks.  Originally i was not playing a Security Precaustions, but after playing I was getting beat by HB.

To start, you should grab Boba Fett, Ship, and Prison.	Then you should manipulate the opponents hand and deck.  Setup Dark Deal and try not to get grappled.

Against any deck that tries to pull some wierd stuff on you with interrupts, just grapple it with the Hel to Pays.  And, as often as you can, use the Twi'lek Advisors to get out most of the Effects.  They are all useful in this deck.
