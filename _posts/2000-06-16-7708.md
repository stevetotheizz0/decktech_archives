Strategy: '

This is basically the best way to go about Bounty HUnting.	None of that bullshit that little kids put in just because it references Bounty Hunters, like Myo, Danz Borin, He's All Your Bounty Hunter, Boba Fett's Blaster, and Res Luk Raauf.  While there are alot of cards I'd liek to put in (like more Hidden Weapons, more SAC, Tatooine Occ, battle interrupts), there just isn't room.  every card in thi deck has  specific purpose, and almsot every card has a use in almost every game.  Let's go over the deck card by card, then summarize.
Note This deck was built Pre-EBO, and is now being retired because EBO will most certainly destroy it.  Please take that into consideration, and review it as a pre-3A deck.

Court of the Vile Gangster
 -forfeit bonus, goo nee tay immunity, pull out ships, pull out DBs, and force loss for the opponent, yippee
I Shall Enjoy Watching You Die
 -major force loss and retrieval
Great Pit of Carkoon
Audience Chamber
Dungeon
 -have to deploy them
Twi'lek Advisor
All Wrapped Up
 -primary capturing means, oota goota plays for free
Rancor Pit
 -Rancor's stomping grounds, massive force loss
Lars Moisture Farm
 -nice drain, weapon bonus
Cantina
 -power bonus, generation, nice drain
Mos Eisley
 -power and forfeit bonus, generation, get rid of that damn Cantina Shuffle
Judland Wastes
 -nice drain, ability 6 to draw destiny
Spaceport Docking Bay
 -pull with COTVG, early generation, transport to some planets, opponent's pilots deploy high, deploy ships to get pilots on, deploy ships for forfeit fodder
Jabba the Hutt
 -activation, forfeit bonus, might want to use SE Jabba for deploy bonus, S&V immune to alter, and cheaper deploy
Mara Jade
 -one mean bitch, pulls lightsaber, spy, the alien Vader
Boba Fett(CC)
 -capturing machine, bounty hunter, hidden weapons, forfeit+5, landspeed=3, adds forfeit even when captive is going to be eaten if he is the escort (adss 5 to opponents loss and to your retrieval)
EPP Fett
 -add destiny, weapon, bounty hunter, hidden weapons
Jodo Kast
 -bounty hunter, landspeed=3, cancel destinies, hidden weapons, destiny 2
EJP Bossk
 -bounty hunter, high power, capturing weapon, draw 0, 1, or 2 to capture obi, luke, leia, han, or chewie if you have a bounty, can chose who to capture after drawing destiny
EJP Dengar
 -bounty hunter, destiny 2, weapon fires twice, awesome with lars farm
 -New ruling characters whose forfeit has been set to 0 who are captured by All Wrpped Up have their forfeit restored before being captured, meaning dengar can try twice to hit a captive, who then must be forfeited with other characters who cant stick around to beat up survivors, and capture for the bounty
ECC IG-88
 -adds a destiny, bounty hunter, capture weapon, high power, high defense value, cannot be attacked when alone, great with lars farm
ECC 4-LOM
 -adds a destiny, bounty hunter, cancels game text, destiny 3, cant be attacked when alone
Bane Malar
Djas Puhr
 -ability 4, bounty hunter, forfeit fodder (forfeit 6 with Court+Jabba, 7 at Mos Eisley)
Boelo
 -cancel destiny
Mosep
 -drain enhancer, forfeit fodder
Chall Bekan
 -pilot, deploy modifier, forfeit fodder
Maras Saber
 -New ruling characters whose forfeit has been set to 0 who are captured by All Wrpped Up have their forfeit restored before being captured, meaning mara can hit a character, who must be forfeited, and have a droid capture him for the bounty, sick
Rancor
 -yummy
Zuckuss in Mist Hunter
 -opted over Zuckuss, because he is the best damn ship in the game, pasenger seat, ability 4, prevents opponent's destiny, 4-lom as passenger adds a destiny
Hounds Tooth
 -opted over Bossk in Hounds Tooth because Bossk is too valuable on the ground
Jabbas Space Cruiser
 -opted over Punishing One and IG-2000 because I dont have them, but also because when deployed tot he DB, Jabba can move over, and launch, stick a probe card, and now the ship is there forever (or until it gets hit by a Intruder Missile)
Slave I
 -opted over Fett in Slave I, because Fett is a cornerstone bounty hunter, should be replaced with either Punishing One or IG-2000
Note Dengar in Punishing One, while good, is not as important as Dengar on the ground, in past decks, persona conflicts were major problems against balanced decks
Scuma nd Villainy
 -deploy helper, force retrieval
First Strike
 -combine with S&V, retirve 3, opponent loses 1
Bounty x2
 -retrieve force in addition to Rancor text
Reactor Terminal
 -destiny tracking very key, return excess cards
Search and Destroy
 -Hidden Base killer, also might help vs EBO, but would still be a tough game
Secret Plans
 -slows down Profit, Harvest, non-uniques, OnOff the Edge, and OMDH/Death Star Plans
Security Precautions
 -extra force, high destiny, Hidden Base force loss, and block a drain with immune to attrtion space cruiser
Expand the Empire
 -combine with mosep at LMF or JW for massive drains
Twilek Advisor
 -search for those effects
Sense
Alter
 -protect yourself agaisnt silver bullets and annoying cards like Rebel Barrier
Torture
 -Numbers Protection, huge destiny, great for tracking
Elis Helrot
 -move, smack, capture
Imperial Barrier
 -stop beatdowns, then beatdown whats left
Sniper
 -use with Iggy or Bossk to capture, Mara and Dengar to kill, or 4LOm to cancel game text
Hidden Weapons
 -backup capture card
You Are Beaten
 -weed out the big guys
Hutt Smooch
 -get rid of spies (A Gift/Boussh)
Oota Goota Solo?
 -4th means of capture, very effective, kills nabrun, kills Kessel Run, use with Secret Plans vs Ralltiir Captians deck


Now that you knwo what everything does

vs M&T
just fight it out and capture, be creative, cards above should give you an idea how to do this (All Wrapped Up, Sniper, YAB, Barrier, Elis, etc), remember to track destiny

vs Profit
who acres if they convert you? bigger drainf or later, garrison the AC, starting with Boelo and Mara, getting out enough to hold it down, sense Someone Who Loves You, and/or Barrier Leia, this match should be easy if you play right, remember to track destiny

vs HB, MWYHL, and non-interactive decks
big drains with Mosep and ETE, plus Search and Destroy and Obj text, ouch, probing is optional, but recommended, remmeber to deploy, probe, battle and retrieve, then next turn retrieve your lost ship with another battle and deploy it from reserve

vs anything else
adapt, most everything you need is there

My major dilemma
want to put in ORS, but not sure what to take out, SAC maybe, but then I'd need There Is No Try, Opressive ENforcement, Grabbers, and some silver bullets for bitch cards, like Point Man, Masterful Move, and Blast Door Controls

Any suggestions on this dillemma and how to beat EBO so I dont have to retire the deck would be appreciated'
