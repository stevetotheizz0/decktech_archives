Strategy: '

This is a very unique, very powerful, high destiny, expensive dueling deck. The Basic Idea is to use the big charecters to go duel or beat down the mains while Counter Assulting their other drains with your Big Destiny Draws (21 6&#8217;s and 7&#8217;s). With an average battle destiny of almost 4, you should be able to knock your opponent out of all ground drains with a little tracking and a little blind luck. Go around and knock their big boys out with dueling and then go around and Crush the Insignificant rebellion.'
