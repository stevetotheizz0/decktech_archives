Strategy: '

I guess the only thing I need to explain is some of my card choices. The Landing Claws are to block drains in the air, this is a ground intensive deck and I don’t have room to devote any more to space. I can fight unless I’m seriously overwhelmed. Sorry About The Mess can get rid of some enemy characters before I fight or before I move away, and it is legal to use it with lightsabres. Lt Blount is insurance against ISB, I got stomped by an ISB deck at states last year with this deck and ISB is one of the tougher matchups I’ll have to deal with. Mercenary Armor, Panic, Life Debt, and I Know are all life insurance for Han, whether I’m whipping out a buddy for him or adding destinies when he’s getting battled. Since cheapo Han is an alien, he can’t be battled at Audience Chamber while I have Bo Shuda out. Corran Horn can also protect him from Arica. All the sites are for generation and to spread out to after I flip, and I won’t pull Obi’s Hut or Cantina unless I need force or if I’m sure I can control them. Finally, Biggs Darklighter is in here because he’s the man. Tatooine native, best friend of Luke, hero of Yavin, and definately underappreciated. I never make a deck without him, and please don’t reduce my rating just for that. Well, I think that’s about it. Thank you for your time.           '
