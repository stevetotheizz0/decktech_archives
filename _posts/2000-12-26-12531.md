Strategy: '

Starting effects depend on opponent.  I use Crush aginst anything that is mains/beats type to stop the extra destiny draws, Imperial Decree against drain decks such as EBO, and Secret Plans agiast retrieval decks like MWYHL.

I have the Coruscant DB as a jump point, yes the activation has the potential to suck, but on the first turn you are able to pull another DB and a 2 force planet, so it will not slow you down for long.  As you look for docking bays, keep in mind your CC sites and draw up if they are not in reserve.  Control the Corusant DB early for extra force, even with a scrub if you have Nevar and Imperial Barrier in hand.
  Deploy Den of Thieves and Chyler.  As you find your Cloud City sites start deploying them(I leave Port Town District in the middle, all the aliens are deploy -1 there) and get out some agents to flip ISB.
  Once ISB is flipped drop out BespinCloud City and a BH ship to set up Dark Deal.  Now all drains are +3, +4 where you have a lightsaber.  If you manage to hold all four of your CC locations then the drain potential is 18 at just the four locations.  Keep in mind all your bonuses, the +4 for Dark Deal, +1 per starship while you control BespinCloud City.

I have no idea how well this will work, and I am thinking of changing out Decree and a couple characters to add in Bespin and Occupation for a little direct damage.


This deck needs a lot of work, and I need as much constructive critisism as I can get on it.  Thanks
