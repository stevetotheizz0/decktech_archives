Strategy: '


Well, this is my final version of this deck. I've been using it since the day it came out (A whole week -), and it seems very strong so far. It went 2-0 in the tournament Saturday, but I usually go 2-0 with each deck, so that's not a big deal.

Everyone knows how testing is done, so I won't bore you with those details. Just make sure that your Dagobah sites look like this
Jungle|Yoda's Hut|Swamp|Bog Clearing|Training Area

When testing, it's all about slowing the damage while testing as fast as you can. Enter my usual start Battle Plan, Wise Advice and Your Insights Serve You Well. Right off the bat they have to pay for their drains, and your test draws are +1, and they can't hit you with Scanning Crews or Odds. Before you complete test +2, make sure you have The Way Of Things deployed, using Signal, drawing, or by losing Your Insights Serve You Well.

While you are testing, use Jedi Luke and his Saber to fight on the ground. He is just a beast. Use Obi for suicide runs, and you should have plenty of space power to hold your own. EPP Obi is mainly for suicide runs.

Most of this deck is pretty self explanitory. It's toughest match is Raltiir Operations, but if you play smart, you should be able to take it. If Generation is ever a problem, just add a Rendevous Point.

I'll gladly answer any questions via D-mail-
Andy
