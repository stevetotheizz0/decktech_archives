Strategy: '

strategy  


the watto strategy isn’t really hard to understand or to explain, watto just likes direct damage, and that’s the fact.

i decided to start with "bad feeling have i" cause EPP’s will kill my watto and this really sucks,don’t forget to 

pull out as the fisrt action "There Is No Try", so you are a litlle bit protect from "alter".i always try to flip watto

the first turn, the best way to flip watto for zero force is in combo with "Televan Koreyy", this small guy just rulez

then i try to get out my jabba’s palace with "Neimoidian Advisor" this card is tech, with the audience chamber, holotable and the bridge

the force activation "must" be enough for watto, give direct damage with "Search & Destroy","Watto" and "First Strike".

i put in also a tatooine maul for the space, maul in ship is a biest, just a QMC Killer, with watto i’am also able to pull

out the Executur and maul in ship, this is always enough for space, cause watto will never drain high he will kick 

a.sses in battle or give his loven DIRECT DAMAGE. so try protect watto and the gane is a auto win don’t deploy to fast

your big mains, (except palpy with janus) keep maul with stick and EPP Vader for the importnat battle againt qui etc. ....


this was the main strat nothing amazing new, but it still works and works and works ......



Why Colo Claw Fish?


i think this card must be in every dark deck (ok if opponent plays starting for light side it’s junk, but otherwise?)

with colo claw fish you’ll be able to kill mains like qui,ben or luke easily it’s a better feelign if you battle and you see 

there is a dest of 6 on the fish so think about it ?



Why Unsalvageable ?


this card is tech, it keeps you watto "alive" and it will help your Executor against Power Pivot or something else and it’s 

a nice dest of 5 and the best thing it’s used interrupt


so the rest of my deck is normal (i think, or?), maybe put in one more "Chance Cube" sometimes it will help you if you keep

this interrupt in hand for battles @ watto’s junkyard.



thx all for reading/rating my deck, and please write helpfull critic or some new awesome ideas
