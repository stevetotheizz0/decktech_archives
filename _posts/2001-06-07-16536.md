Strategy: '

Well, it’s kinda late but i’ll try my best to type straight and give goood strategy. The base of the deck is to beatdown your opponent and drain but if you get the chance pull off the run luke run one turn kill. You can do it first turn if you get a good draw but it’s never happened. the earliest i did it was third turn. usually my opponent starts two aliens, so i play leia in front of them, master luke for free at jabba’s palace, ive got a bad feeling, someone who loves you to free han, run luke run, and any battle destiny adders. get +5 power from aim high for shooting with han and leia. kill in one turn. If your opponent doesn’t come to tatooine, good for you, spread with the characters and drain and cause damage with the objective. I have no space because nobody is playing full space anywhere around here so it works well. went undefeated in last tourney. Lots of backup characters and high destiny. Can take on any ground deck. lots of anti duel stuff. RLR AND jedi escape. 


That’s all, sorry for it being all choppy and messy like, i’m tired and i should have gone to sleep a long time ago. well that’s the deck.  '
