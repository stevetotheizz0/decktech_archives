Strategy: 

 
this dech is very simple.And forgive me i forgot to put up Rondevu camp , and one less con missle.
Once you got all your systems down start laying all you bewings.Have a i-on cannon and a con missle aevery where .So you can hit ships easily.Then forc drain them as much as you can.
