Strategy: '

this deck has a shot against just about anything.... it has lots of battle strength and the numbers are like a bonus....when i start haven, i can deploy quickly and have enouigh generation for the ground if I have to.The savrip works well and numbers are a bonus(forfiet those droids) but be careful how u use it or u may get screwed....... if you play carefully this deck can beat most decks '
