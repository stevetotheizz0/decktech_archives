Cards 


Outrider & Dash Great for winning battles in space and controlling Tatooine. If needed Dash can help out on the ground. It reduces opponets power and can get around the galaxy easy with a hyperspeed of 5. 


Wedge, Red 1, Tycho, and Green 3 Canel opponets destiny and great to win battles in space of jsut sontrol a system. A drain of one at Tatooine for 10 truns can make alot if diffrence. 


Houjix & Out of Nowhere Get yourself out of a jam, or add a destiny in space, great cards that can win you game if played at the right time. 


Control & Tunnel Vision This card can pull you just about any card you need + cancel a nesty force drain of five. This had definetly won me many games so don’t try to say it sucks. 


Matchups


Court You rule Tat in this game, if you cant deploy to get into Jabba’s Palace, then move in at Jabba’s Palace use Fallen Portal. Use tunnel vision to get the beatdown cards. Use Weapon Lev. to steal Mara’s saber and Kill jabba. Be careful though don’t let them battle you, and try hard to cancel Scum and Villiany. If you cant get into the palace, just drain at your sites and retrieve. Wait with your tricks and when they try to attack you slit their throat and win. IF they try to kill you in space be careful, cancel their destiny’s and overpower them. They will be giving you tons of activation, so don’t worry about not having enough to deploy your mains. Very common in my area an I haven’t had much probelms with it. 


BHBM Really tough unless you play it right. Use luke on early suicde runs before you hand him over. Drain for as much as possible and Retrieve. When a opportunity open up beat him down. If you hit him hard enough one battle can end the game. IF they are more focused around space strike in their weakest location and wipe them out. Use your spies to get to their DB’s with a fallen portal and a tracked destiny and say bye bye vader and Tarkin combo. Vader is tough, but he cant take on Luke, Obi, Leia, and Lando. You could always Lev, his saber. Careful you don’t overdeploy. You should be retrieving about 2-3 per turn. If the game is 10-15 turns long you could be retrieving up to 45 force per game. With all that retrival opponnent dosn’t have much chance, but still be careful BHBM can be very tricky. 


Hunt Down Drain and Retrieve fast and you can always hide from duels at the Home One Docking Bay. If you do get stuck you can always use Run, luke Run or Courage. You can use your spies to beat dwon the opponet at their own docking bays. If they come to space use your destiny adders and destroy them there. Very tough if they manage to duel you. Use your tunnel Visions to set up twice as fast an cantrols if really needed. 


Ties Drain on the ground quick an hold your system and retrieve. If a weak spot opens up use your ships, Added Destiny’s, and opponets reduced power because of I’ll take the leader. Your retrival should win you this game. Much depends on luck of the draw and Oppponets Skill. If they have big drains you caould uuse your controls to cancel them, then retrieve them agian and use the tunnel vision part. I haven’t palyed many of them because only one person in my area play them. Tough, but can be done. 


Your retrieval and drains combined should be to mush for your opponet, but with the added beatdown power this deck is really tough to beat.


Thanks for Reading and Reviewing


This deck has gone 11-1 so far in local tournament play.
