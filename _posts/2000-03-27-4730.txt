Strategy: 

This is a pretty standard Court deck. It wins by battling, capturing, and retrieving with Scum, First Strike, Bounties, etc. Although, many of the ships pilots are included w/ gun, you simply use them on ground, when you don't need them in space.

Vs. Ops- Crossfire helps, as does J'Quille. You can also hope to beat the down and capture as needed.
Vs. Hidden Base- Start Sec. Precautions and pull your ships as needed.
Vs. Mind What you have learned- Battle what they have, and drain early and use the 1 force loss to hurt them slowly but surely.
Vs. Profit- Simply control the AC w/ brute power, unless they are playing the cheesey Orders to Engage version. If this is the case, simply don't deplot there if you see Uh Oh or Bo Shuda.

Most cards are self explanatory, although here are some explanations:
Crossfire- bonuses w/ the weapons, and hurts X-wing and speeder swarm.
J'Quille- Hurts Ops and other small time characters.
Projective Telepathy- Retrieve for iniation, but cancel the battle.

Thanks in advance for reviewing my deck, and if you have any questions or comments, message me. Thanks!
