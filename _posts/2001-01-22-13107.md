Strategy: '

This training deck is just full of tech.
 first you start off by pulling daughter, the training area, and a test. start training by third turn. proceed by doing this each turn, all the tests should be easy to pass. when you pass test 5 you should have a 5 or a 6 tracked for it, and have 10 force saved because secret plans will be out, if CHYBC out place a scrub at both your opponents BGs then retrieve, if the dont have 2 battle grounds out then you should be ok because that means you have not been drained for a lot any way. The tauntaun bones are in there because with test 3 out you can always take advantage of it.
	When test 5 is passed, fight were they are, they wont beat you. Just place guy after guy down until they run out of characters, then drain at thier locations.

	Against BHBM, shold be an easy win, start YISYW then pull i feel the conflict with it, give them luke RS and dsend em to the throne room, they will not win duels by test 3 since all thier destinies are minus 1. they will keep stacking with it. you will win in the end.

	  against Scum, laugh at them when they get thier drain of 2 for 6 force when you bring battle plan and test 1 out. you will win because they arnt going to retrieve any for most of the game and test 6 will drain them out with out vader

	  against hunt down... this is probably the toughest game to play against. get honor out unless they start no escape. get a spy to cancel visage (unless honor out)train like normal and lose your force like a man. try as hard as possible to retrieve your 10 in the end. once at test 5 bring down guys to kill the barage of vaders coming your way. You should be victorios if you play right and have a little luck.

ALL OTHER decks should be a breeze to beat. This deck is really good and has won me a lot of tourneys. Every game should be yours if you can afford to retrieve the 10 force in the end. have fun with it.   '
