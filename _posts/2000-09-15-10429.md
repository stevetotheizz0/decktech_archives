Strategy: '

Well, not exactly an easy way to explain, but let’s dive right in.  Your goal in the first part of the game is to get those three sites occupied with rebel scouts  Madine and Solo from Strike Planning, rebel scouts (and Geezum to get sites out) with Madine.  Try to get Tala 1 or Tala 2 with a little support to the system, Gold Squad 1 works fine, that way you can kick in Close Air Support and maybe scare him off of Endor (I don’t have a Blount, hence the reason he’s not in the deck, though Close Air Support only cares if it is Tala 1 or 2).  Anyways, you want your objective flipped, makes toasting the bunker a world easier.  Also your force drains can’t be screwed with at all, and kills his force drain mods (considering you have someone up at Endor, Menace Fades).  Also, both draws to kill the bunker are now at +2  Anyways, now you need to drain drain drain... Ithorian + Midge and you should be doing a good 3 per drain on the ground, Luke+stick/pro and DoS+stick... drains of 5 and 4, backed up with a healthy 3.  Stunt your opponent early with Striking Planning his endor force away, Battle Planning to make draining more expensive, and Menace Fade his drain mods away (also pick and choose with Lost in the Wilderness).	Anyways, best of luck, hope this one is pleasing enough to you.  Take it easy '
