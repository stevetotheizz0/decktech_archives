Strategy: '

Start with Objective + All Wrapped Up + CC Port Town Disctrict and Any Methods Necessary + CC Security Tower + EPP Boba + ECC Boba.
With ETE on CC PTD your CC Troopers are deploy 1 and power 3 (5 with Trooper Assault) on three CC sites.
Just go for the fast flip if possible. You want to battle on Cloud City so let him come.
No Bespin / Bespin Occupation because it's too hard to defend.
