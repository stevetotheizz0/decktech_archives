Strategy: 

Read before you rate:

note: take out empire’s new order, add a presence or grabber, and replace the emperor and janus with mara and epp boba.

Pull Wakeelmui, ds war room and a 1/0 db, deploy scrubs, get massive activation goin, either 1st or second turn plop Onith down and watch your opponent scramble to get his characters down, and hopefully you can off them with yours, and send any they draw to the lost pile.
The shear activation of this deck is frightenting. after you know whats in there hand w/onith pull the tat db, and start drainin, and hopefully you’ll get your other tat sites, presence, for big drains and get S+D goin to finish your opponent off.

Hutt smooch is perfect to capture the Boushh and keep thier best female character in check, it can also protect onith with its other ability to return spies to hand.

I’d just as soon kiss a wookie is obvious: keep it untill they tunnel and pull luke and hope to deploy a male, but just return him to their hand so he can die next turn.

Alters are for goonee tay, projections and frozen assets.

You still have a good amount of space and ground power to deal with any thing they get out, invade thier hoth sites for a good drain and to cancel thier bonuses.

This deck was orginally a big activation=big beetdown, but i think onith makes it even better.

this deck is pretty metaless so adapt it to where you play, maybe add you cannot hide forever against numbers and security precaitons against hb.

this deck kills profit, it forces them to deploy quick, if not they’re screwed, and your deck certainly doesn’t help them activate, let them save han before you deploy onith so they can’t retrive the characters onith killed. if profits big maybe fit in a maserful move and set for stun to return han to hand then kill em.

against there is good in him try to capture luke right away, and let onith take care of the rest, monnaks for speeders, if this deck is big in your area maybe ditch the walkers and go with sites like the cantina.

CHYBC takes care of drains at ds and db.

well i think thats enough, please read the whole thing.
