Strategy: '

Start Profit & Uh-Oh. Deploy BoShuda & OTE to get to AC clear or let opponent loose force. Deploy Tessek & Rennek @ AC, combined with It's A Trap they are very safe.

Artoo / R-3PO + A Gift then move to T JP to let DS have no drains at your Tatooine sites. You Will Take Me To Jabba Now can be used to avoid Bubo.

Now it's deploy & drain at Cloud City. All CC sites are interior so you needn't fear any walkers. DS has to come with characters. Aliens will be cripled by A Gift and most Imperials used are pilots so use Scramble. Vader is still dangerous (he should be).

With Pucumyr & Tessek you'll get cheap drains of 3 or 4.

There is no space for space, but i'm thinking of Yoxgit + RLiR1 + GLiG1 + Landing Claw. '
