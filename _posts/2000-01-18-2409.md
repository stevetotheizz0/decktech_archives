Strategy: '

This deck is ready to take on the world, at least on Tattoonie. The characters can stand up almost anything the light can throw at you. It is more of a fun themed deck but it can beat a LS Tattoonie deck. The ships look for HB and the effects help maximze drains and block some of the oponests. '
