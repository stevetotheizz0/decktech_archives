Final Update******************************

Well I guess the decks record doesnt mean anything to a lot of folks. They just cant seem to see past the list and some even scratch their head and rate low because its combat. I say build it and give it a try. My play style is what dictates the cards for me and has generated my sucess with the deck. Some cards may not suit you though. Thats just the way I play, and that is very aggressively. It just happens to be a go for the throat type of deck. It keeps pushing for the chink in the opponents armor. Then it rips it open the little spots and eats the flesh below. Like Ive said, its a brutally efficient deck. If you cant see the uses for the council Im sorry, but that dosnt mean they arent very useful. The insignificant manipulation they provide has won games for me. In Star Wars its not just a war of giants and power. Its also a war of stealth and subterfuge. And this deck has them all. Enjoy.

End Update ********************************** 


Update 2********************

The deck has come up against several scum decks including Court. This decks only lose is attributed to a TIE deck, not Court. Scum just doesnt have the staying power to contend with this deck. With the exception of maybe Maul On The Rocks I cant think of a Bounty Hunter platform that has ever even given me a run for my money.

End Update 2***********************


Update 3************************

Lets set this straight. This deck has lost ONLY ONE match to TIEs. It has played against them about 9 different times as well. Even the senate ties combat killer deck. It wins verses dark combat too. I can remeber one really nasty match where I didnt have my 7s stacked yet (of which there are 3) and I was losing 2 each move phase. I saved Panaka, Amidala, Lando, and Chewie and enough force for 2 turns. Dropped them and battled a lone dark jedi with overflow of 42. Game,set, match. I won by a landslide. All throughout the match I was utilizing Strike Blocked to reduce their destinies from there stacked 7s. It was easy enough to pull one of the two back into hand every turn too do to the high activation. So in short I do win against dark combat. So far every time.

End Update****************************


Update 4************************

Remove Restraining bolt and put in Scramble. They may have to waste a shield on it, or they might already have there 3 sheilds out and not be able to counter it. Thanks to those who told me where to find the Bolt ruling.

End Update****************************************


Its a simple deck and yes it is Lightsaber Combat. So if your on the Lightsaber Combat is G. A. Y. band wagon dont bother reviewing the deck. Instead take your attitude and shove it somewhere warm and wet with a little bit of odor.


Tournament play 12-1. Casual play 52-0. Thats right, only one loss.


Anyway, on to the deck and how it works. Actually, lets take a different approach. Im going to tell you how to beat the deck and then the counter strategies. One of the decks strong points is its character mix. But this also can be an exploitable weakness. One of the best ways to take advantage of this is to make some of the characters lost. Cards like He Hasnt Come Back Yet or Sandwhirl, Icestorm, all have great missing effects. Although they are sometimes easily countered by just not becoming a target. Sense, Alter, and Control tend to nueter their effectiveness too, although no longer as commonly played anymore. Another way to exploit the character mix is with the Dark Jedi Presence beat squad. Drop a few scrubs with your dark jedi and play the interrupt to pour on the pain. Of course it also is easily countered with Blast The Door Kid. 


Space, the final frontier. And also this decks main weakness. With only one ship in the whole deck it lacks the ability to contend with a space force. So drains in space will be uncontested. No way around this really, the decks main focus is to control the ground, and that is what it does.


Droids. I hate to play this deck, Invasion I mean. It keeps throwing those damn droids back at you every turn with enough attrition to rape you. What’s the answer? Council manipulation and running away. Can’t win run, can’t run fight Lots of different interrupts help keep you clear of death. Plus one of them takes a droid out before their text can hurt you. Don’t forget the other part of We Don’t Have Time For This’ game text, it kills battle droids.


Dark Deal for a long time has been a powerful and dominating deck archtype. Still it is viable but has taken a hit with the zero side of Lightsaber Combat. Their dark jedi cant drain here so expect to see a frieght train of sith headed your way. So deal with them. Gift Of The Mentor and We Dont Have Time For This to add some power to the mix. And if things get bad Blast The Door Kid out of there.


Now for some of the strong points of the deck. I have 2 undercover spies in the form of TK-422 and Boushh. Boushh can carry Leias Blaster Rifle which works well with Colo Claw Fish and interfernce from the jedi council. Also you have 2 Projection Of A Skywalker to help reduce the opponents drains with non-dark jedi. This really tends to hurt decks like court where battleground sites are few to start with. The spies can also permanently shut down Hunt Downs big pain Visage Of The Emperor. Having trouble with Maul and his double bladed swizzle stick of death? Use Armament Dismantled and scrrew his draws with Plo Koon. Want to cuase some direct damage? Make sure his Maul stays off the table, (Darth Mauls Demise) Then get Padme out and Mace at the council chamber for 2 a turn. Are they trying to exert a force choke? Choke back with Obi-Wans Apparition. Suddenly the choke has just tightened on them, especially if they werent smart enough to occupy some of the sites they dropped for themselves. Now they wont have the force to do so en mess and you can drop a small beat squad down to take care of them. Therefore reversing the forc choke situation.


Against something like walkers youll want to set up the jedi council and then use your forces to counter and battle their forces on Hoth. So expect them to save their dark jedi for you to go to Hoth with Obi-Wan and Qui-gon. Drop combat cards on your other jedi at the council chamber then deploy Panaka or padme down to create a gateway for Yoda to send in the jedi and Combat the opponents dark jedi off the table. Continue to drain after youve flipped and take the game.


Matchups-

BHBM- Give them luke. Stack some combat cards on him to rig the duels outcomes and beat his forces back that he throws at you throughout the game.


Dark Deal- Discussed above. A victory.


Hunt Down- Takes a beating and keeps on going. Youve got the tools to take this deck out.


Walkers- Discussed above. Victory.


Dark Combat- Double up on your combat cards and expect to play a very long calculated game. Your lesser ability characters can make all the difference in the world.


Invasion- A win and discussed above in more detail.          '
