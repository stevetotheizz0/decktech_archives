Strategy: '

CHANGE 1)	I have decided that to start with the Death Star is the best option, so try that and tell me what you think.
Take out the Combat readiness and put in another Twi'lek advisor.

This deck is very good I think.  I have taken most of the EJP and ECC and made it better.  Everyone knows that Big Blue is a very good deck type to default to no matter the enviroment.

vs. Hidden Base...play out your starships and get the starships out of your deck.  Then play Security Precautions if they decide to flip.

vs. OPS...you can start Battle Order and you should not have too many problems.  If you are in an area where bonuses are very high, I would suggest that you add a Hoth System and then play Imperial Decree.

vs. Mains and Toys...never fear, you have the power of a lot of men, play Wounded Wookie if you need it.
