Strategy: '

based on a solid review I changed the following things I removed 2 X-wings and 3 Organized Attacks and an It Could be Worse...as advised I threw in some more red cards. I added some more HDADTJ protection in Glancing Blow x2 and Anakins Saber. I also added a pair of Clashes to aid in the beatdown with what seems to be a paltry batch of characters. The mains coupled witht he retrieval are indeed devastating. I also didnt get to finish my Meta report on how to play the deck in my last review...This deck is incredibly good against the Big Blue decks running rampant right now. The sites are interior...which means NO walkers. EPP's hack the Imps forfeits to shreds without their walkers. SHould they bring walkers down to the Plaza cancel the drain withNorth Corridor or Harc Seff. It was adives that I put Yoda in and less ships..but I want to be able to defend againt the heavy hitting space decks and Yoda would just add another one even more useless than the next card(Hes only good for ther attrition WHEN you get him out. Its not a MWYHL folks.) Revise with caution..this deck deserves a *4* at least. Ive been known to kill people for low reviews. If your wondering how to play the deck a little more check out the last version.'
