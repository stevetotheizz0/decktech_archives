Strategy: '

Hmmm, I forgot all about a grabber. Take out whatever you want and put a grabber in. 


Well, here is the strategy


Don’t play with your head in your ass. If you do, you will lose. If you are patient and can set up smoothly, you ought not lose. I played some gay version of this deck and lost. The reason I lost is due to the fact that Dave Monteiro is a cheater-) and Talon Kardde is a @#$%. I took out some ISB agents, and I lost. Keep the deck the way it is(a grabber or 2 won’t hurt) 



The intros are retarded
This deck kicked ass and took names. Beating WYS, HB Mains, and EBO.

This deck pretty much runs itself. What you need to do is shut down their drains and win the game in space. This deck can easily put an ISB agent at a battleground site to modify my opponents drains. 

If you want more of strategy, d-mail me or if I have 5 5 star ratings I’ll add one-)
