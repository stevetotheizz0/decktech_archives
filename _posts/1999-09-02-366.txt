Strategy: 

	This is the deck i won the regional qualifier at ConGames with (it's not half as big as it sounds).  It is missing some effects now, but at the time i was most worried about revolvers and beat downs, and strangely since endor had JUST appeared, the light endor objective was a question mark.  It utilizes the endor objective for big, mostly unrevolvable force, and perimeter to hinder prevention of your high drains.

    Start with perimeter patrol (unless a yavin revo deck, start imperial arrest order), plop a character there first turn.  Almost no matter who it is you should have a decent chance of sensing and altering as the destinies are quite low.  If it is a revo deck, there is not much he can do to take away your force, except revolving the bunker which is a waste of a card.  As long as the perimeter is set up, go for iao right away to protect yourself from nabrun.

    At this point, you should have little trouble on endor obviously especially from rebels.  Any rebel who deploys to endor first must lose a force and cannot battle or move.  If opponent tries to deploy mains or gets them over with nabrun in move phase, sit on some heavies like the walkers and igar, since you are getting big force, drop down for big power.  Expand the empire on the forest clearing (2) and your vehicles will be power +1 at three sites and drain +1 at three sites.  If no one comes to endor, drains are huge.  Pull out a ghhhk early on to protect the chump at the bunker, and it's a good idea to back him up, or move out of there. Use bubo to nab spies or kill ops.  Heavy monnoks and sac help against cheese.  Amazingly, I even beat a speeder ops/13 operatives deck by altering yarna first turn and monnoking.  He never flipped.
Oh, and of course, probe for hidden base and a pure space deck will not be able to take your drains.  Also beat a mains, battle deck.  Enjoy, it's a little out of tech, but there isn't anything on the site utilizing Dark Endor, so maybe it'll spark some ideas, and it is extremely fun, very old school.

    Feel free to write with any questions or comments or to discuss strategy.

Addendum: Man, this deck is ancient now.  Sorry.  Even though it is sticking around, i'd not recommend using it in it's current form.  I'd ask that there be no more ratings on it, again except as a deck type, not as specific cards.  This deck was from the first week of endor.  Newer players can take a look at it though as a good Old Skool style deck template.  And it might prove useful for constructing a non flipping endor deck, the drains are good.  Just to advise.
