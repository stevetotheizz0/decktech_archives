Strategy: '

Youve seen this entertainment through and through

...Jim Morrison...amazing.
Anyway, this another ISB space deck. This particular deck is the exact one I played at WA states against Michael Fortman, Derek Snook, and Matt Bryant...and it went 3-0. The fact that I played this deck at states also means I built it before Hunter submitted his, so dont just say I copied his decklist. 

Now, a little history
I was first inspired to build an ISB space deck after reading a few Hunter tourney reports. Apparently I wasnt the only one inspired as several versions started popping up. I looked at few of this decklists, (Joe Horbeys, Justin Fleenors, and Joe Olsons), and after studying Hunters reports more closely, I came up with this, and its good...real good.

Now, a little Tech
The character selection is a good diversity of ISB agents mixed with Admirals, spies, and some heavy hitters. Nothing new. The effects are all defensive, except for the Lateral Damage. They buy you time against speed and cheese so you can win in the clutch. Nothing new. The interrupts are also mainly defensive with a few surprises. Overload and Overwhelmed can be game winners (just ask Snook) if timed right, but they can also be used to help in a battle (No power pivots or SWM). Other than that, Commands, Point Man, Ghhk/Those Rebels...Nothing New. The starships are a mix of pure beef and flexibility. All the SD provide tanks in space, while the Bounty Hunter ships add support. Really, Nothing new here either.

Youve seen this entertainment through and through

Now, a little execution
Your start never changes, grab Executor before you do anything with Mob. Points. Set up Piet/Merrejk at the ExecDB ASAP to start activating and grabbing systems. Once you got that going, deploy to space at will keeping  your tech handy for surprise beatdown/anti-beatdown. Drain from there, and use whatever you need to win.

Finally, a little counter-rant
Here are my responses to some reviews I KNOW I am going to get

Un-Original Yeah? So? I like to play it, it wins. You come up with something fun and original, dont wait for me to do it.

No Guri 6 force for a card that basically does what Imperial Command does for free? Sorry, not today.

Start YISYW I only use 3 Endor/DSII effects...and I currently start with all of them. If you feel I need the numbers protection... You bring numbers to your next tourney and see how well you fare.

Strat Section is too short The only time I post a looong startegy section is when I am submitting a deck I havent seen before, because then its needed. For something like this, I dont feel I need to go real in-depth. To better show what I mean When I see a deck I like, I copy the decklist as best I can, and completely ignore the strategy, if I decide to print out the decklist, I delete the strategy section before I do. Doing this has made me develop my own play style for each deck I play, and it has made me a better player. This deck is an old theme, very well-known and documented, make your own strategy.

Later all.
