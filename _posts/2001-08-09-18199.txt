Strategy: '

Quite a fun deck to play.  
On your first turn before you activate, grab Evader/Monnok. During deploy grab a docking bay from deck. If you have Guri in your hand and enough force to deploy her set her down with the Prince. Guri is very important to this deck as she keeps the Prince safe (in case you didnt know).  Note if Guri is in your force pile. In any case, move prince to docking bay and try to draw Guri if you didnt have her.  From here, grab docking bays, activate mad force, and defeat your opponent  where ever he may be.  Get your objective flipped as soon as you can and protect the prince.  Try to get you opponent to Endor so it becomes very expensive for him to run away. The deck is light on space so choose your battles carefully and make sure you have a significant force before attacking.

Card Choices
One must remember the wisdom of Machiavelli, By arming your subjects, you make their arms your own from The Prince. Nine of the character cards in this deck have build in weapons, one can get an axe, three can use hidden weapons, and four use lightning. It is always wise to go into battle armed.

3 Princes? I find three necessary to keep the objective flipped. Fallen portal, weapons, Jar Jar, and other evil tactics cause tremendous trouble.

Destroyer droids- Most likely some of the best characters in Coruscant. Use the objective to set up the hits and make you opponent lose one or two force each time.

Hidden Weapons- This card is great fun. If your objective is flipped you can easily capture a character or better yet, cause them to be immediately lost. Tracking isn’t that hard either if Luke is at a battleground. A good amount of threes and twos in the deck. I find two Bobas and a Jodos are needed to maximize the use of this card.

Projective Telepathy- It has saved me many times. The opponent drops an early spy + a character w/ a weapon against the prince, but usually will not have enough force to continue the battle. Bonus- also cancels Anger, Fear, Aggression.

Secret Plans- Many people use this card, but against podracing, I like to hold this card in my hand until they are about to win the podrace. Seldom do people save 6 force to retrieve.

Theyre Still Coming Through-  Fallen portal is bad, really, really bad.  Use this once and you opponent will think twice about playing it again. Also cancels smoke screen, nasty with all the new Jedi.  Recycles if you cant play it.

Presence of the Force- In my opinion, one of the best cards in the card. The ability to create battlegrounds is huge, and adds to both force drains and activation. Best of all, crush stops Clash from canceling Presence.

Emperor Palpatine- Everyone loves the emperor, but getting more than four is difficult
without a wad of cash.  


Give this deck a try. You too can see the power of the mighty prince.  '
