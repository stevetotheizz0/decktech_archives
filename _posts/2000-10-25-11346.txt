Strategy: 

This deck uses KDY and WIAPN to give you SDs that are immune to attrition less then six plus BH in Ships that are immune to various amounts. Put a Vader at the Med. Cha. and add battle destiny at any location. Don’t drain at Kuat, Use Chireaneau at Yavin 4 with the rest of you systems for a hefty drain of 7-11 per turn. Return to base will save any ships that are lost, while Imp. Decree will slow down their draining as long as you control Hoth and Yavin 4. If necessary, use Mara and Vader to knock out pests. Avoid this because they may kill them slowly costing you major battle damage. I think everybody knows how to defeat any of the major strategies being played today so I won’t give you a matchup guide. If you want one anyway, then d-mail me. I want a lot of feed-back please and I will post an updated version after I have some reviews and have played it more. Thanks for reading this.
