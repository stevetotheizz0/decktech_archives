Strategy: '

This is my first attempt ever at a Mains deck.  I just wanted a deck that had super high destinies for all sorts of things.  The destiny layout for this deck (minus the starting cards) is

0- 4 (1 can be pulled)

1-6

2- 3

3- 11

4- 8

5- 15

6- 7

7- 1


My general strategy for this deck is this  Get out Traffic Control ASAP.  This, along with Threepio, will be a key card.  This deck allows you to cycle through all your cards, taking what you need, leaving what you dont.  Use the Suprise Assaults to damage anyone draining (I once got Mara for 2 each turn one game).  I have several easily trackable cards if you need a 6, but usually the destiny shouldnt need to be tracked.  Also, this deck won all 3 of its Podraces this past tournament.  Selbulba has no chance (ok, so maybe a little one).  


Card Breakdown

Jar-Jar  Just a fun card

Shmi Pulls Threepio

Suprise Assault  Really fun against drain decks, and any deck that tries to drain.

Revo  Some more force activation

Corran  Kills spies

Fallen Portal  With these destinies, why not?

Blaster Deflection Helps keep Qui-Gon alive

Lost in the Wilderness  If they have a bit more power to SA comfortably

Barrier  Beatdown protection

ICBW  Helps stop drains

Wars Not Make One Great  Helps vs. drains and battles

Shocking  Stops Merrejk and Myoom

Changing the Odds  stop the Chance cube, destinies a little too high, and checking reserve decks

Quite a Mercenary  Elis protection

Gift O T Mentor  Adds 2 destinies

Bith Shuffle & Desperate Reach  Cancels Barrier, shuffles decks

Careful Planning  When you need that boost in force during the battle.

A Jedis Patience If I draw a low dueling destiny or if Luke defending a battle.

Droid Shutdown  More helpful than youd think.  Stops Threepio from dying

Fall Back  Beatdown protection

Signal  pull the effects

A Step Backwards  if its a close race

Eyes in the Dark really annoying

Hindsight  Lets you view cards in Used pile.  HUGE  Use to track for destinies or Threepio.

Losing Track  damage their racer or put a low destiny on top of their reserve.

TMAC good tracker

FOTL good tracker

Double Agent  If Mara decides to come down on Lando or Corran, you can take her out.

Entering the Arena  pull a 0 out or add a destiny

Dont forget the droids  anti-numbers

Strangle  High destiny, anti- BHBM


The strategy is to build up a force of mains and helpers in your hand while winning the podrace, retrieving with figrin, etc.  I can get a max of 9 destinies in one battle, and if the enemys not careful, theyll be dead in one huge battle.  This deck wont do too good against a SYCFA space, but itll pretty much kill everything else.

If you tell me what to put in, tell me what to take out.  I appreciate your suggestions.  Thanx in advance.

As a recap, I will be pulling all of my low destinies out ASAP '
