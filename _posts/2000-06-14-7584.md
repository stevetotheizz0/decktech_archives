Strategy: '

I got the title idea from a Limp Bizkit shirt. I hope everybody likes Limp Bizkit.

Start with Cantina, and I like to start with Presence of the Force on there. It gives you a great speed advantage, because with one of the Vaders or the Mara you should have a drain of 3+ by your third turn, which is hard to deal with so early. Throw Tarkin down there, and with all your interrupts, you shouln't have a hard time controlling the site. In space, you have a whole lot of guys that should be able to hold a system or 2 fairly safely. I left out the Executor because 15 is way to high to pay for one card. The dueling is there as a backup, and you can play Monnok to see if there holding Courage Of A Skywalker. Since no destiny is drawn for Circle, Vader and Lightsaber win against anyone but Ben Kenobi. One weakness is numbers, but I chose to leave defense out because no people near me play LS numbers. You can take out one of the Circles for a Resistance or Torture without hurting the deck. Speeders shouldn't be much of a problem, because your site is interior and you can still set up Imperial Decree with your systems.'
