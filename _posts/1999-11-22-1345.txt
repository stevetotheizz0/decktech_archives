Strategy: 

This deck plays like straight big blue (obviously)go where they are and beat the hell out of them. I included lots of #'s protection and HB hate (search & destroy is awesome vs. hb #'s) cause i figure those decks are gonna be popular since people usually copy the world champ decks.
If you play an ops deck its best to just dogpile one site w/ atat's, set up abcttu, and flip your objective so you can avoid a speeder beatdown. If it turns out they arent playing speeder beatdown just spread out and take over the planet. All the other strategies should be obvious. If their is something you have a q about just send me a msg off my member page.
