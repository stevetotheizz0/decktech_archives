---response to reviews  Maul does hurt, but keep in mind I have effectively 6 tunnel visions in this deck.  that will be enough to pull him out, won’t it?.  Phylo is not in here because I don’t have her.---



First off, youre probably wondering why I start The Signal.  Its for several reasons


The only other effect that is safe to start is Menace Fades.  Battle Plan (I dont have the combo card, by the way - exchange as necessary) is not a safe card to start because you usually dont have anything on the ground for a turn or 2, but you almost always get someone (Dash optimally) to Kessel first turn, so you can drain next turn.  Hence, I dont want to spend 3 force to drain.  My activation in early-game is limited, so I need all I can get.


And the biggest reason I start The Signal... is to flip, then use it to pull out Polarized Negative Power Coupling.  Since I cant start it w/ HFTMF, I use the Signal.  The only effect I need out at start is Squadron Assignments.  So I play the Signal.  Then, when I flip, play Signal from your lost pile to pull out Polarized Negative Power Coupling.  Note that Alter will not work on Polarized, because of the objective.  Then the hurting starts.


My basic strategy is to hold the Cantina and Kessel, and thats all.  The drains of 5 a turn will really add up.  Even if they play that new effect that limits drains to 1, I can just play Control (if memory serves me, its not immune to control).  So, they will be eating 5 a turn from drains.  That really adds up quickly, and its not too hard to hold them both.  For example, if you have Outrider and the Falcon at Kessel with their respective pilots, thats 3 battle destiny with a massive power advantage.  Any combination of Outrider and other Ship is devastating, which is why I have 2 Outriders and Dashes.  Maul will hurt if he comes to space, so you just need to get Melas in your hand ASAP.  Do NOT deploy him though, unless they have Miyyoom.  From my experience, they deploy Maul with his Infiltrator and usually dont cloak because that 1 card in your hand couldnt possibly be Melas  Alas, it is.  Then they die.


Now to hold the Cantina it is a little bit more difficult.  3 smugglers in it will do the trick usually, but a DVDLOTS with You Are Beaten will really hurt, but thats true with any deck.  I usually have 4-5 smugglers in the cantina at all times, with the bulk of them being ability < 3.  The reason for this is because of the neat card Blast The Door Kid  which stops battles completely or makes them pay... dearly.  Another ”Cantina Helper” I have is All My Urchins.  This card is good in any deck, but especially in this.  They lose 2 force to battle... which is nice.  If you get to play Blast The Door, Kid  its adding insult to injury.


Avoid trying to spread your troops.  Its way too risky.  Ive gotten beat down BIG time by getting greedy.  Trust me, the 5 a turn will add up quickly.  Holding the 2 locations will satisfy Menace Fades, Battle Plan, and the force drains needed to win.


One problem you might see is activation.  True, it is a little bit slow in the beginning, but most dark decks nowadays give you enough force to handle yourself well.  Also, even with only my starting locations, I activate enough to solidly flip 3rd turn.  This means activation at kessel is now +1.  Which helps.  Since the smugglers are so cheap, its really not a big problem.  At least I havent had a problem with it...


Lets explain some card choices


Visored Vision - The BANE of all dark decks.  This card devastates almost every single deck.  For example, use it to get rid of Vaders Obsessions.  Or use it to get rid of All Power To Weapons.  Use it against any single card, it will wreck them.  Or just play 2 a turn USED version, ping them for 2-6 a turn.  Its really nasty.  Also, keep in mind you can just play them from your lost pile.  Also keep in mind that Polarized flips the used pile and really lets you go at it.  This card causes an average of 10 force loss per game, even more in an indirect way (making them lose pivotal cards).  Try this, you will always play with them.  This card should be errated... but it is definetely one of the best cards right now combined with The Signal start and Polarized after flipping.  The pinging doesnt stop for the rest of the game.  If they grab it, it doesnt matter.  The drains will kill them off anyways.  This is just an added bonus.


Controls/TVs - I dont have any more Combo cards.  Exchange as you want.  Also, the destiny is higher, and grabbers wont hurt if they grab one of the non-combo cards.  The destiny is higher enough to warrent the use of non-combo.  For example, lets say you draw 2 combo cards of Control.  You have a measily destiny 2.  However, lets say you draw a control and a tunnel vision.  Thats 5, which is enough to break most Vaders immunity, Mauls immunity, Maras immunity, and more.  Its the little things that count.


Tatooine Celebration - why do I play this if I only want to hold 1 site?  Well, the 1 retrieval a turn helps if you just deploy to the docking bay and move over.  Or, if theyre playing really heavy space, just dont play with it.  Simple as that.  Same with The Planet That Its Farthest From.  Play it if you want, it doesnt matter really.  Most of the games I play, they never see the table.


Transmission Terminated (non-combo) - Anti-This Is Some Rescue.  Most Hunt Down decks play with 2 This Is Some Rescues and 1 or 2 Holonet Transmissions.  Therefore, if they have 1 Holonet and 2 This Is Some... in their hand, you play OOC/TT and they cancel with This Is Some...  You play it again from lost pile, they cancel with the other one.  You play TT, they cancel with Holonet.  Next turn, play TT from lost pile and you finally get rid of Visage.  Its just better this way.


Houjix & OON - Im paranoid of massive beatdowns with You Are Beaten, so I pack 2 of these.  Also, the OON version helps many times, so keep that in mind.


Why no retrieval?  I dont really need it.  Tatooine Celebration works occasionally, but you really dont need retrieval.  Most of your cards will be out of play anyways.


If you have any questions whatsoever, PLEASE d-mail or instant message me at PCGSAlucard.  This is my favorite deck and I take personal pride in it.  Thank you for reading and reviewing.


P.S. - If you play with this deck, I absolutely guarantee you that you will win if you play it correctly.  Im not saying this to be @#$%y, but this is an absolute truth.  Give it a shot, dont say I dont like it.  Thank you.  '
