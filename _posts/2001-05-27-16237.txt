Strategy: 

Set up witht the Watch Your Step Objective. Use heading to the medical frigate to start wise advice/there is no try, battle plan, and draw their fire.  This will help to reduce your opponents senses and alters before you flip.  Battle plan will slow down the amount of force you will lose before you kill them.  Draw their fire is so they dont play interrupts during battle.

Against most decks, you wanna wait for your opponent to get set up wherever they are, then deploy han there with a RFC and luke to an adjacent site. Play Frozen Assets or beggar to eliminate their force remaining in the force pile. Then play ive got a bad feeling about this to initiate a battle.  Play Run, Luke Run to move luke over and add 2 to his power. Use Dont Get @#$%y and some other interupts to add destiny or prevent your opponent from getting destiny. Then, shoot their people and draw destiny.  Your opponent should owe you a large number of force from this battle, so it will probably be game.  Usually between 30-70 cards. This strategy works well against almost any deck.

However, if they are playing in space you must deploy all your people up on freightors and force them to get no destiny while increasing your own. Thats how this deck works.

This deck works well, because it gets an initial 6 force and is able to drain at the cantina for 2 if opponent goes in space.  It is capable of beating any deck.
