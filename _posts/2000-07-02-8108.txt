Strategy: '

me and another local guy named brad mcgee used versions of this deck throughout dragon con to go a combined 13-2 over the weekend. It lost to a CPI obj manipulator played by ray bordier and a spread and drain isb w/ scanning crews played by scott anderson in the thursday night tourney (i changed the deck a little after the loss and it should be able to beat this now). this deck is not hard to play at all as far as setting things up. its not that difficult to play just get some games in w/ it and youll kick ass.

61st card bron burs
62nd card 4th Transmission terminated

vs. rops set up ebo and occupy ralltir early on to delay a flip when he drops ships drop a beatdown squad on him and beat him down
spread and drain in space and use your ebo schmoes and other characters to stop imp decree and flip him back on ocassion

vs. hunt down cancel visage and block his drains and drain in space auto win

vs. isb look at hunt down and take out the cancel visage stuff

vs. cpi obj get an xwing to D* 1st turn and win
pretty close to an auto win
