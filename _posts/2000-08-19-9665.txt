 Update

 Well for those people who don't know the cards the reason i don't play with IAO is well why pull 1 DB a turn when i can pull them all with Docking Bay Control Room, I can also still elis whenever i want so.

Well here's the deck. You start SYCFA (duh). You use Prepared Defenses to pull Battle Order and Mobilization Points (I don't want to start the game with 1/6 of my deck gone). The first site you search for is the control room obviously so you can pull the docking bays, for the activation and Rendili with MP. You get the engine set up with ADT to make them pick up what you can kill with Onith, monnok to kill doubles or shrink down their hand and onith to kill all the males.

 What To Do Against Certain Decks.

 Any deck which starts Yarna or plays it early
 (which would be Swarm or Speeder Beats or something around those lines)
 Drop someone quick and alter it, which should be pretty easy with this deck, then monnok like you've never monnoked before.

 TIGIH
 Keep Luke from getting any support for his battling. And if Luke gets siezed just Elis away and Luke will be left behind.

 Profit/RTP
 Same Deal do the manip and have Dannik take care of Han/Leia

 MWYHL
 Haven't gone up against a good one yet so I haven't got it worked out yet.

 Well that's pretty much it good luck with it
