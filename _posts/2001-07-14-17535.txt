I need a brand new friend who doesnt bother me. I need a brand new friend who doesnt trouble me. I need someone, (yeah) who doesnt need me.

Jim Morrision sums up this deck in those brilliant lyrics (from ”Hyacinth House”) This deck is strong, can force drain, can battle, and can be played by anybody. 

The idea is to get lots of force for mains and battle your opponents characters away. Maul for free, move him over to Jabbas Palace, then get Jabba/Xixor in the AU for a nice drain of 2 or 3, while everyone else goes and battles wherever my opponent is if they are not on Tatooine. That is the ideal situation, but it varies. I dont use the Emperor since he cant deploy for a beatdown, and I dont have room for his support cards, and I feel this deck is solid without him. I know it is hard to get 3 mains with their matching sticks, but the ratio is just right, (2 Mauls saber  4 Mauls, 1 Maras Saber  1 Mara, 1 Vaders Saber  2 DLOTS) and with Mara grabbing her saber and with 2 Weapon Levitations, its not an issue. Finally, on character choice, I use the Jabba Crew instead of Imperial main, walkers, whatever, because I feel they are more versatile due to built in weapons, and setting up double-destiny combos is incredibly easy. (Fett + IG, Fett + Jabba, IG + 4-Lom, IG + Dengar, IG + Aurra, Xixor + Jabba, 4-Lom + Jabba).

Recently (today) at a tourney, I beat a AITC/Elom/Podracing deck with only Maul, Mighty Jabba, Xixor, Mara, and Vader. The red is that strong. I beat Douglas Harvillas Kessel Mein Kampf (whatever, I dont know German) with just Maul, EPP Vader, Mara, Jabba, and EJP Dengar. The red is that strong (monnok 2nd turn for two EPP Hans and two Jedi Lukes). I also beat Walter Zylowskis RST deck with just Maul, Mara, DLOTS, 4-Lom, and Jabba. (see a pattern here?). Yes, the red is that strong. 
	The interrupts are designed soley for battle and protection. Jabbas Through w/You works with 4 of my characters (5 if Aurra has stolen a saber since it doesnt specify), and is a used 5. I Have y/Now is great in a deck with 7 Jedi, but I only use 1 since people tend to avoid Maul, and although it works with 7 characters, it only works with two different characters. You are Beaten/Sniper&Dark Strike are GAME WINNERS Nuff. said. Blast Door Controls/Search and Destroy are anti-cheese and anti-Hidden Base, while First Strike is great for its surprise factor. The 2 Weapon Levs. are used 4s that get me Lightsabers...be they mine or my opponents Finally, the last Red card that I feel needs justification is...Teemtos Podracer.
	I never try to win a Podrace, since LS will win pretty much every time, so I try to stall them while I set up and damage them. I chose Teemto over Sebulba for 3 reasons
1) Teemtos Pod is a higher destiny if you dont see Podracing.
2) With destiny 5, Teemtos Pod is near impossible to play Losing Track on.
3) Teemto adds 2, close enough to Sebulba, and it lets me recycle high-destnies I might need while at the same time, could replace low destinies with high ones.

I would go into deck match-ups, but its late, and this is just a mains deck. What do mains decks usually beat? Other Mains, Throne Room, TIGIH, and RST. What does it usually lose to? EBO and Hidden Base flip. And, what decks sometimes beat it, and it sometimes beats? QMC, WYS, and Profit.

Well, thats it. If this strategy is too short, just build it and play it, youll get the jist of it. (Remember what Jim said?) If this strat section is too short, and you dont have the cards to build it, too bad for you, guess you just dont understand mains... ;). Whatever. Its mains, thats all, but a very solid mains deck.
