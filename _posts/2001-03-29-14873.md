***UPDATE - I already said that this deck is unoriginal, but I mainly posted this deck for feedback and not criticisms for being unoriginal.  Please rate the deck on how good it is and what you think it needs rather then originality.  Thank you.***


The title of the deck comes from Arizona Diamondback Randy Johnsons fastball which killed a bird on its way to the plate.  I dont condone killing birds, but it was an amazing thing to see, so check it out at www.collegehumor.com if you havent seen it yet.


This is my new Hidden Base Mains deck, and while it lacks originality, its a solid deck which can match up with anything the Dark Side can throw at you.


The start is always Insurrection and DoDN/WA for free grabbers and SAC, but the 3rd slot can be used for either Staging Areas(the usual choice) or Menace Fades depending on what you play against.  All the locations can be fetched to set up early activation to allow you to set up your game plan.  Establish drains on the ground with some mains while waiting for the opponent to do something.  If you are going to be battling in space, set up the Super Falcon.  Otherwise the Home One and Spiral can do an adequate job to keep Menace Fades in effect.  You have lots of helpful battling interrupts along with all the mains and utility characters like Corran and Blount in order to establish control of the board.  Start tracking around FoTL and TMANC to use with Off the Edge and On The Edge for retrieval and battlng as well.  Here are some card choices and why I use them


Honor of the Jedi - its still awesome, since Hunt Down is the only deck I ever see No Escape in, and even then, it can save you quite a bit of damage.  It prevents Court damage, BHBM damage, S+D Damage, Direct Damage of any kind, and drains at War Room and Yodas Hut if they go over there.


Lt. Blount - ISB is still strong, and with backup, he can keep them from ever flipping.  Hes also a spy, 6 forfeit with Insurrection, and a good pilot to boot.


Oonee Tay - Rops is still alive and kicking and this can hurt them badly.  Even then, this makes None Shall Pass bareable, and getting back the top card of your lost pile can make the difference in a game.


Courage of a Skywalker - helps in dueling since I wont always have a saber to use with Glancing Blow, and it can also give you a nice power boost with Jedi Luke if you need it.  I still might throw in the Glancing Blow, so give me your opinion on which one you think is better and why.


The Obi and Luke mix - Ben goes to the Tatooine Docking Bay, and Jedi Luke goes to the Home One Docking Bay cheap, and they can transit to where ever you need them.  One each of the EPPs because they can be useful at times and also reduce your risk to monnok.


One EPP Han and one Captain Han - originally I had 2 Captain Hans in here, but I often didnt need him for the Super Falcon, and EPP Han can rock on the ground adding destiny with Chewie or Luke when needed.


Anakins Saber - usually it goes on Luke, but I like the versatility of it going on Leia when needed.


Here are some cards I would like to get in here, but there is no room as of now


Aim High

Revolution

Glancing Blow

Bacta Tank

I Hope Shes All Right

Punch It

I Know

Tunnel Vision


Anyway, here are the matchups


Hunt Down - you have 3 spies and 2 OOC/TT to cancel Visage.  Keep them from flipping with Luke and Ben at docking bays, and use your battle cards to mess them up.  Courage helps against dueling as does tracking.  The egde cards can make up for whatever early damage they can do.


BHBM - abuse EPP Luke if they spread out, and then give them Jedi Luke to make them lose from the objective.  Keep your forces consolidated, and use your battling cards to your advantage.  Try not to lose battles, and retrieve when possible.


Any Scum (CCT, MKOS, Court) - take over Jabbas Palace early if possible to keep their activation low.  Fallen Portal is key here as are all the useful interrupts.  Get out Oonee Tay to hurt None Shall Pass, and Honor can negate any direct damage they can do if you can keep them from occupying 3 battlegrounds which isnt too hard.  Set up Menace Fades at Corulag to stop Galid and put the pressure on them.  The bith shuffle combo card can cancel barrier to set up beatdowns. 


SYCFA or Endor Ops - Menace Fades is key in these matchups.  Ties are a tough match, but Order to Engage combined with Super Falcon can keep them on their toes while you drain at any ground locations you can get your hands on.  You activate a ton versus these decks, so starting Staging Areas is not needed in these games.  Abuse your retrieval, play smart, and you will be all right.


Any Other deck - Battle them when the time is right.  Set up Menace Fades if the need arises.  Track high destinies for battling and retrieving.
