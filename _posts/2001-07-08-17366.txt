EDIT 1
TO TK424 I can’t beleave you are still mad about all that stuff. After all you crapped on my EBO deck with a one star first, and every body know’s the gold’n’rule. ”do one to others, as you would want done to you”. if you still want to ”thank me your way”(i hope you don’t mean sexually) the next time you are in Daytona, FL just let me know. 
END EDIT

EDIT 2
Christo said that only tie/ins can tallon roll. If this is true please let me know. It say’s any one rebel and one imperial. If so, can the emperors sheild’s t-roll.
END EDIT


First I don’t have any bounty hunters in there ships, thats why I use tie’s. I can’t afford the cards i need to make hunt down, bhbm, and aobs decks. That is why I play endor ops. so don’t rate my deck bad because I don’t have any emperor’s, named starships, or a better obj.


Start with mob-point, resistance, and secret plan’s. if they are playing ebo, start imperial decree. Now after you have your starting hand, look through your deck and pull and carida(if it is in hand pull excutor). most people say pull exector, but if ls is not playing space you don’t need it and carida is a place to drain from for at least 1 with rumors it is +2 and i get 2 more force on my second turn. during control phase pull ominous rumors.

most of the time you start with 6 force, 5 of your own and 1 from light side. more than likely you have at least 2 at-at’s and/or at-st’s in hand. if you are brave put down something on the platform(db)and lay down carida and any site if you got one in hand, other wise use 2 force and put down ominous rumors and draw up some cards unless you are saving force.

I did get nailed once playing a profit spaceport speeders deck. on his first turn he ended up with starting like 20 force laid down obi-wan, chewbacca, and jar-jar. all i know is he took out both at-st’s and i lost 7 cards on the first turn. needless to say i ended up losing that game.

2nd turn you start with at least 8 force and pull esb. do your best to have at least one battle destany at each ground site. if for whatever reason you only have starship’s lay them on endor.


There is not really much else to say. try to flip obj. if they are not playing any space, put ship’s at your other 2 systems. my best force drain with this deck was a 14, but normally you get a 8 or 10 drain. you can get up to a 19, but you would be spread thin and most likely get a beat down.


vs ebo. start decree and win the drain race.

vs tigih. i don’t know never played it. it will be hard to flip your obj. more than likely they have enough ship’s to make a good fight in space. i’m not sure what happens, because i use mostly combat vehicles. do i still capture luke. if so should i put down vader and duel him. please let me know if i should put him down or not.

vs rst. same as tigih, except put vader, maul, and/or mara in bunker or at back door. don’t let them blow up bunker. this is one the hardest decks to beat with endor ops. it comes down to who win’s most of the battles. usally i can win in space but the ground is much harder.

vs hb/x-swarm. spread out on the ground. keep your ships at endor. you should win the race drain.

vs hb/mains. i have only played x/swarm version. stay ready on on ground. . 

vs profit. usally not much space if any. drain in space and stay ready on the ground. keep enough force to react if they come to endor.

vs wys. i have played this deck twice. won once and lost once. usally they wait for you to come to them and beat you down. stay on endor, if you go after them they will beat you down. not many spy’s so don’t worry about getting blocked on the ground.

vs mwyhl. after they do first test it get’s really hard. i lose all my force drain bonus and usally can’t get a drain for more than 6 or 7.

vs qmc. this is about the only time i pull excutor, instead of carida. you need to control the system first, before they flip. if you take out 2 or 3 of there ship’s they usally don’t have much more to mount an attack. you also may have to go after them on the ground to if you can’t win in space. 

card’s i need. trample’s, presence of the force, and bounty hunters in ship’s. when i get them i will put them in.     '
