Starting Stuff
Rescue The Princess, Prisoner 2187, Death Star Detention Block Corridor, Death Star Docking Bay 327, Yavin 4 Docking Bay, Yavin 4 War Room, Heading For The Medical Frigate for Stike Planning, Insurrection, and Staging Areas

Basic Start
Prior to activating, if you didn’t get him in opening hand, use Strike Planning to pull Crix.  After activating, use Insurrection to pull the Endor DB (also use this opportunity to see if Sgt. Carlson is in there).  Deploy Crix to the Yavin 4 DB and Sgt. Carlson there.

Strategy
Now, you should have a decent amount of activation.  Use The Signal to get out Cell 2187 and free P2187 fast.  Use Crix to pull Wuta, and get him out with backup to the Endor DB and start pulling Endor sites out.
Once P2187 is freed, replace her with DOS and get to Endor.  Set up your Ewoks, Kazak, and Ithorians, and drain.  With your flipped objective, your opponent will reconsider making a direct assault.  Use EPP Obi and Jedi Luke to go after your opponent off-Endor and/or support your Ewoks on Endor.  Use Gift Of The Mentor to pull whichever saber you need.  With the consisent amount of damage you’ll be doing to your opponent, victory should be yours, but always be careful.	The one Rebel Barrier is in to prevent a large beatdown and to stay alive a turn longer.
Force retrieval engine is Nar Shaddaa on the Ewok Spearman and Death Star Plans on 8D8 if necessary.
