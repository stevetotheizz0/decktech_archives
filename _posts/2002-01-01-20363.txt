Hello everyone,

*Update*
I’m taking out a It could be worse for a Path of least restience.
*End update*

Well, lets just get right down to it.  You start with the Guest Quarters, get to your ships, KTEOF, and menace fades. Get your ships out first, try and get atleast Dash or Ric to bespin between first or third turn.  The Characters with the Lightsabers are for beating down ethier Watto or Lightsaber combat characters.  This deck has major problems with Hunt down but I think you just use Corran and OOC to cancel visage and drain at executor sites.  Anyways, get your other characters set up on Bespin and drain for around 5. Use the celebration combo with the jedis resilience to have unlimited Jedi. You take force back with the celebration and then activate it and draw it with KTEOF.  Electrobinoculars are the most under rated card in the game. Ill just pay the force, draw a 7 with off the edge and get tons of force back, that is of course if they dont have imperial arrest order/secret plans out. 
Cards that look dumb and should not be in here
red 6 Come on Destiny 6 and Wedge can cancel destinys with Jek
Electrobinoculars Look above.
Any other cards why you dont know why are in here, just ask.
Thats about it.

decks it will go up against
Watto The deck eats Watto for breakfast. The EPPs kill Watto and use the combo to get OOcs faster to make Watto out of play.  This deck controls space and ground, Battle plan eats this deck up.

Lightsaber combat Battle plan. Thats all I have to say. EPPs kill off Jedi, and with the drain race you will win.

Hunt down This deck has problems.  Conrol space and any bespin site. OOC Vader and cancel Visage at all costs.

ROPS Yum...ROPS......You know, I dont know how to play against this Free ride gets their AT-STs and Battle plan will eat them.  Raltiirmust be controled by you earily. Make sure you control that other then Bespin first.


If you have any questions ethier E-mail me at Crewman Wilson@cs.com or just post it here.

Thanks,
