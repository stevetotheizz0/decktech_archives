strategy


this deck trains luke to 5 or 6. i use luke because he pulls his saber makin my test destiny obscenly low and incase some one actually comes down to dagobah

after this deck flips, i use on/off the edge to retrieve and go around bashing my opponent


match ups


endor ops(no flip)

no problems here. this deck type falls easily to my mwyhl and poses little threat.



endor ops(flip)

problem especially if they have perimeter patrol(?) to slow me down. handle space and keep up the pressure to wear down the opponent. retrieve as always.


mkos

this could be trouble just because of my low total power. keep on going and pray they don’t retrieve too much


hunt down

watch out for vador and go about your business training and battling


bhbm

no worries. be happy.

keep luke from vader and you’re set. leave him on dagobah


thanks
