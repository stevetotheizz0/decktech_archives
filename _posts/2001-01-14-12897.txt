Strategy: '

This deck is just fun to play, fairly simple too.

To start, you want to go grab the Executor Docking bay and drop Ephant Mon there (losing 1 force to Court is not that big a deal).  Also make sure you’ve grabbed Redili before activation and play it.
Next turn try to get the Sail Barge out w/ Power of the Hutt... then start to fortify your positions, not much too if from there. capture. feed. retrieve. repeat.

A few of the cards are fairly specific to some stuff I hate
Bubo I hate when people drop Bo Shuda and little dinky alien guys in my audience chamber, Bubo is there to eat them.
Bib He really causes Profit some problems when he’s on the table... Han can’t run away anymore.
Mercenary Pilot Adds a destiny when flying the Barge.
Always Thinking w/ Your Stomach Used to be good against TIGIH, probably getting pulled.
Defensive Fire & Hutt Smooch Boussh and Artoo/3P0 (We don’t need no stinking Gifts)
Omni Box & It’s Worse I HATE facing Jedi test when they have a 7 up their sleeve... so Omni box is my quick solution.
There Is No Try & Oppressive Enforcement Protecting Hutt Influence is important at times.

Any feedback you have that could be helpful would be appreciated... this deck is getting pulled apart for Carbon Chamber testing soon though -) '
