Strategy: 

This deck is just fun to play, fairly simple too.

To start, you want to go grab the Executor Docking bay and drop Ephant Mon there (losing 1 force to Court is not that big a deal).  Also make sure you’ve grabbed Redili before activation and play it.
Next turn try to get the Sail Barge out w/ Power of the Hutt... then start to fortify your positions, not much too if from there. capture. feed. retrieve. repeat.

A few of the cards are fairly specific to some stuff I hate:
Bubo: I hate when people drop Bo Shuda and little dinky alien guys in my audience chamber, Bubo is there to eat them.
Bib: He really causes Profit some problems when he’s on the table... Han can’t run away anymore.
Mercenary Pilot: Adds a destiny when flying the Barge.
Always Thinking w/ Your Stomach: Used to be good against TIGIH, probably getting pulled.
Defensive Fire & Hutt Smooch: Boussh and Artoo/3P0 (We don’t need no stinking Gifts)
Omni Box & It’s Worse: I HATE facing Jedi test when they have a 7 up their sleeve... so Omni box is my quick solution.
There Is No Try & Oppressive Enforcement: Protecting Hutt Influence is important at times.

Any feedback you have that could be helpful would be appreciated... this deck is getting pulled apart for Carbon Chamber testing soon though :-)
