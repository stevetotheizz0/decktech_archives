Strategy: '

You can tell a lot about someone's deck from their starting hand. So scan first turn. Get BCC first, then Bespin for force gen (which is key, and also half the reason why SP is started with).

Set up DD when you've got a look at their hand and it's all safe. CC Occ is there for extra damage when you can afford it. Most TDIGWATT decks don't want to worry about flipping, and this one doesn't either. If you can, well, more power to you. But it's in no way the goal. Only do CC Occ if it's safe (you should be getting frequent looks at their hand all game long).

If SCrew is caught, no big deal. Speed up your gameplan by all means. There's a mix of ships in the deck - merely to set up DD - but BIHT and BIS1 are obviously good for a variety of things. Vader's Shuttle is one of THE best ships in the game. It's too versatile.

Against M&T, scan scan scan. Keep yourself in control and do the right stuff at the right time (which is vital).

Against Ops, alter their Yarna if you can and Monnok them away. Take the battle to them if you can, there's a MM and Ghhhk in there for all situations, but it'll help avoid beats. Whether you SCrew regularly or not will depend on what sort of Ops deck it is, but mostly just get the DD and CC Occ up and running. Damage is enough. Elis can be key.

Against HB you have the SP start. Scan, decide what sort of deck it is, get a fast deal if swarm and keep scanning if it's beatdown.

Against MWYHL, this is the only instance you start Broken Con. You're getting 2 force from them, so it's ok. Scan early. If it's a fakeout to some other strategy, don't worry about the fast DD. If it's training at all, speed up if you have a good start. Otherwise, play it safe and use CC Occ if you can. But this deck should beat training every time.

As for the Profit start, take Mara and Mii'yoom. You can grab Mara's saber and walk outside for a drain of 3, scanning all the while to remove rebels. But the Mii'yoom start is filthiest, just run over their hand as and when necessary and you'll have no opposition. If you get the chance to do this, do it.

Sense and Alter troublesome stuff. It's enough, believe me. Might want to think about going 3 Alter and having a Barrier instead, but it's a personal thing. Sense can get those shockings after all. Anyway, enjoy the deck. '
