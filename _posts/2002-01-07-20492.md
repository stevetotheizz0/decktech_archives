Strategy: '

     Alright, alright, your probably looking at this conglomeration and just see a pile.  Well it ain’t.  You’ve got 2 Hit Jedi in there to do with as you please,  plenty of characters and starships, and MASSIVE activation.  6+ on turn one 10+ after that(provided you draw the holotable or a Masterful move).  Evader/monnok keeps your opponent from drawing more than 12. Arnet and those rebels wont escape us keeps dumb things like dodge from working right.  Just keep one thing in mind  ”Let Them Make The First Move.”

Really, it works.  If you deploy anything other than sites it should be a jedi to the generator core. Stunning leader and force field are in there because i’ve lost my jedi before they could combat in playtesting.  


Update 1  

  As for not enough High destiny you obviously didn’t see Janus,  and even though my tech rating ain’t that high I can assure you that I am competant enough to track destiny.  LESS characters?  Are you high.  The only thing I’ve learned recently about the game is that everyone gets enough destiny to clear about 2 characters per battle if anything I would add more but alas Dark Side characters are a pile of crap compared to the light.
