Strategy: 

The Strategy is pretty easy. Draw untill you have characters in hand, and then start deploying at Audience Chamber. Battle untill able to free Han.
Your opponent will deploy guys at the Audience chamber, but will your beat down should be easy to defeat him, with weapon levitation, and disarms you can make sure he doesn’t have weapons that can hurt you. Master Luke deploys for free so that is a good advantage,a nd u cna search for his saber in used pile  with wapon lev. or reserve deck with gift of the mentor, and when he is with Ben, u can kick major butt, by drawoing 3 destinies with the gift of the mentor.
