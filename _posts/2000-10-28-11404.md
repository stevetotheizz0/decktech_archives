Strategy: 

Apparantly I forgot to put Yoda’s Hut in the decklist. Please include it.

First turn pull the Hut, Yoda, and a 1/0 DB.

Once you get a good amount of force going, your main objective is to battle. If they dont deploy, drop a couple of lesser characters 1 or 2 DBs with Fallen Portal/Reb Barrier ready. Then once they have guys down, just attck with the big mains.

If they deploy first, its the same type of thing. Just stack a few destinies w/ the recycling interrupts or via traffic control and then drop big beatdowns.

Have fun.
