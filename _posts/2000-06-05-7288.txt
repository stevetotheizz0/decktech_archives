Strategy: 

note:it turns out im 1 card shy of 60 so add big
coward.thanks for your reviews!

start ice plains and CR for the 3rd marker.
this gives u 5 force and an excellent location
to drain/fight. And thats the whole point of this deck,to drain and fight.
the weapon destiny bonus at the 3rd marker is great and most people will think twice before trying to take you on there.

Against certain decks:
Throne room:well if they play w/revo you will
want to get crush fast.3 twileks along w/2 evaders
should do it.otherwise just set up drains and fight,fight,fight.theres lots of nifty tricks to pull on there guys.my favorite is the unexpected ice storm.

MWYHL:wow 7 force the 1st turn.this wont be too
hard but if they test it might slow you down.
if you can get broken con. out early you can get
in some big drains before they cut them down to size.search and destroy will eat them away unless they come to u.

Hidden Base:there are many types of hidden base
so you have to wait to see which one hes playin.
search and destroy will hurt them and security precautions hoses them if they flip.

ops:battle order and decree hurts.I havent played
an ops deck in a while but its not that hot.

Profit:so far i dont start w/aliens and its done alright so...Set up big drains and decree then
do some fightin in tatooine.Itll probably be a close game but DS can pull it off.

thats basically it.I mainly use this to playtest other decks but its fun to play and Im passive so I posted it.

Some cards to think about adding are:
trample,grabber,another twilek,and the homing beacon.

send me any ?s or comments
and thanks for checking this out.
