Strategy: '

Here is the strategy, broken down by card type
Start if they are not playing numbers(haha) use you cannot hide forever to pull perimeter patrol to give you some safety on Endor untill you can get set up.  Pill the Endor shield via bunker once you get out the DS2.
Admiral&#8217;s Orders I include 2 because of destiny and being able to quickly replace one if the other is converted. Battle Deployment allows me to search my reserve deck for combat vehicles. Fighters coming in hurts swarm and grants immunity.
Locations DS2 gives me a drain for two or three, a place to put a lowly TIE untill reinforcement comes. Onyx 2 is a Good TIE to put here since he deploys free and has hyperdrive so he can evade any potential attackers
Characters Most are pilots for TIEs or Star Destroyers. Fenson and Ephant Mon go into the bunker to prevent deployment of spies to bunker and to add to deploy cost of opponents characters. Piett pulls your Aos or Chiranaheu who gives plus 1 to all drains at systems that you control with a SD. So put a TIE and star Destroyer at every system and youll be set. Merrejk is good for pulling systems and piloting a Star Destroyer.
Starships Basically one TIE and one SD to a system with reinforcements where neccesary. One of my favorite combos is to use DS-181-4 to pull his ship, then pull another interceptor via his game text and then the interceptor&#8217;s pilot via combat response.
Vehicles I used these because they have permanent pilots and I do not want to waste deck space piloting my vehicles.  Use them to control endor or use docking bay transit to attack.
Effects Mobilization points give me the generation I need to power my deck.  Opresive enforcement ups destiny woes. Decree is EBO protection. IAO helps my pilots a lot.
Interrupts You know what to do with these. )
This deck gets good drains in space as well as substantial, unmodifiable drains on Endor itself. Well thanx for sticking with me in this long strategy.
