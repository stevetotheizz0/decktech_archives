Strategy: 

Okay, now for the fun stuff. This deck is all about gambling. You can take your time setting up Dark Deal, all the while gambling with Sabacc. Get Lando and Lobot out at the casino ASAP (Lobot should be no problem, because you can pull him with A Real Hero), preferably aboard one of the AT-AT&#8217;s to protect them from weapons fire. Keep your opponent away with A Real Hero (lets your Lando add 2 (!) battle destinies in ANY battle), and keep retrieving force. Try to get R2-Q2 on the AT-AT as well- during your draw phase, scan the top three cards of your deck so you know how your gambling will go! It&#8217;s legalized cheating! (Question for you smart people out there: Can R2-Q2&#8217;s ability be used more than once? It doesn&#8217;t say "Once per turn" on the card.) Basically, you can set up Dark Deal at your own pace, then pound the snot out of your opponent.

For version 2.0, I decided to start Any Methods Necessary with Zuckuss and ZiMH, plus the prison, because the ability to get Disco Lando out on the first turn is invaluable. I should also be able to get Lobot in my first few turns, and once they’re on an AT-AT, they’re safe from just about anything. I can also put Expand the Empire on the Casino, making a few other sites casinos as well. Well, since I didn’t get any feedback on the first one, I would appreciate it if SOMEONE would read this and give me your thoughts. And remember, KEEP DISCO EVIL.
