Strategy: '

***********************************************************
It should be 1 Monnok and 1 Monnok & Evader so you can pull one with Crush and one with masterful to recirculate it if need be.

Also it should be Sniper & Dark Strike, not just Dark Strike.
***********************************************************

Card Choices

Dengar w/Blaster  He can shoot patrol crafts.

No Escape  Granted Honor isn’t seen very often, but it’s still a good card, and I like to retrieve that 1 card.

The Idea

The idea is to set up at the DBs and drain, battle if he/she gets a drain going and when you get your destiny set up via Reactor terminal and Janus, duel

Versus

MBO/DBO  Look your opponent right in the eyes and laugh hysterically.  Then win by 40.

Hidden Mains  Grab there recirculating 6s.  Battle and duel.  Play Smart.

EBO/HB  Battle in space and spread out at the DBs.

Profit  Battle as much as possible.  Keep Han off the table.  Don’t worry about the first flip, just get Han off the board asap afterwards.
