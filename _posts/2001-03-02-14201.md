Strategy: '

The startegy i simple, build up a space defense at the Tatooine System, with ability 7 or higher because of thedark side characters like Xzior and Zuckuss in ship. The deploy your grounf forces with Luke, Chewie and Tallon Karde at the Cantina. If he bulids a large force there, then spread out your raiders and patrol craft and then defeat him. About mid game, get out the Lars familiy + Their farm and start getting back your lost force, and then deplo more stuff and win the game. Once you get the Tatooine Celebration, Battle Plan and others out, then you will have no trouble winning. This deck has gone 14-0 with monster victories. 


Why Iâ€™ll Take the Leader?


That is mainly to give you some imunity to attrition for your ships and can be used to also add an extra force to your drains at the docking bays. 


For Tha Palace Raiders, just deploy them at the tatooine sites, and then deploy the vehicles and set of the Harvest junk and start retriving some lost force.
