Strategy: '

Strategy Set up - start draining and you gotta win the battles.

Use the dark path/set for stun, to set up a leathal combination. This essentially stops the benefit from MWYHL decks.

Hidden Base...if you get jabba, cruiser, and pilot in space with security up, just probe kessel and block that drain

ops - go right to their plant, stun the op and beat up on the speeder.
