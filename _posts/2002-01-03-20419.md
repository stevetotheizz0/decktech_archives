Just because its not a typical WYS doesnt mean its a bad WYS, Retwin316.  Please explain why you think it is the worst WYS ever BEFORE you press the SEND button.


Also, just for Retwin, I have used every single garbage card in there several times before, none of them can be considered useless.  If you do think so, would you at least tell me which ones you are looking at?


And Llama, giving me 1/2 star to get back at me for a low rating does nothing to make me mad.  Actually sorta makes me laugh to think that you actually believe dectech means that much to me.  No, I won’t delete your review, I’ll leave it up so other people can go see your decks/rants that lower the very method you are using to get back at me.



DISCLAIMER-----------------------------------


This is one of the most suprisingly effective decks I have seen on decktech.  It DOES, however, contribute to high levels of stress and increased heart failure, though, as no game will be won by more than 20.  All games are taken down to the last minute, constantly resulting in shortened or disappearing fingernails.

---------------------------------------------


Once again, major props to PCGSAlucard, although I have never met you and dont know you, I gotta give you huge credit for the idea of this deck.



Most opponents will come in and see WYS, assuming it will be beats or solid, although their eyes will pop out when they see The Signal.  First off, there is not another effect I need to start, menace fades can be nice but I cycle through my deck so fast via threepio/mirax anyways it doesnt matter.  After I flip, the signal allows me to pull Polarized from my reserve deck, lettign me start pinging for a few damage every so often with V Vision.  It usually goes for about 8-12 damage per game, which is quite significant.


(Yes, this will work more than once against one person/deck)


2 dashes/outrider b/c he is the best choice for dropping 1st turn to kessel.


Added on to the drains of (usually) about 2-7 every turn, the damage really adds up.  As I said before, though, this deck can quite often bring it down to the wire, in which situations it often prevails as all the characters are low deploy, destinies are high, and therefore beats are possible even later on.  Were Doomed is another game winning crucial cards.  use threepio to track it and ICBW around and you will be set end game.  It doesnt win big but it wins a lot. 


Although it is limited to a low base of characters with the smuggler restriction, blast the door kid along with cards like talon and the objective make percision beats esay.  Say they drop Maul w/ saber, vader w/ saber, and dr. E on 2 raltiir captains and murr danod at the cantina. Instant beatdown? I think not.  Blast the door kid, and suddenly Dr. E is all alone.  If Chewie Protector was there to cancel Dr. Es text, then your opponent is in really deep.  But lets ignore that for the moment.  So they have power 6 and a destiny, you ahve power 7 and 2 desinies due to the cantinas power boost and the objective.  with the objectives forfeit boost, just a captain will probably cover your attrition, and they will be down significantly. 


This can be used offensively as well.  Drop a squad + blast TDK on Maul and mosep on naboo against combat and they are REALLY screwed.


Most decks can be handled with space or ground.  The main deck that hurts is ties (senate ties esp)

since all of my ships are starfighters, keep track of any cannons they might have, and pick your battles carefully. hold the ground tight, try to take wakelmui to increase tie deploy.  wedge with cannons is your best friend.  use visored on any ghhks, power to weapons, etc...  Difficult but can be won.  


Remember that most of the damage will come from battles and drains, but dont get overconfident or spread to thin or you will lose. period. this deck kicks almost everything but only if you are very careful and drive the jackhammer in any cracks in the opponents deck.  They have 2 imperial artilleries in their used pile, smack them for 2 with visored used, then make them lose the artilleries with visored lost.  Oh, no, is that your only vaders obseession in your used pile?  VISORED VISION NO DUEL FOR YOU


Were doomed is the bomb card.  thats why there are two.  very, VERY useful in those close end game situations


Hunt Down

 put Luke in a ship at kessel with dash, cpt han, etc, drain at any sites available but watch for beats.


 Court

Keep guys at cantina, drain away, their space is no match for yours.


 Senate

set up fast, visored vision will leave them lacking all the interrupts they need.  you need to spread out a little more as they use that effect that cancels your drains.


 TIEs

Already mentioned in above paragraphs


 YMSYL

suprisingly not as difficult as it would seem.  unless you just lose every ship you have in your deck, you will control all systems and with menace fades keep down their drains.  try to beatdown if possible, but dont stress it.  used visored on trample, garrison, etc..


 DARK DEAL

Havent faced up to this with this deck yet, but I think menace will keep them under control.  your space will probably beat theirs, use visored heavily if they play troopers.


Although the defensive shield certainly hoses it down a little, it can be manuvered around.  lose the cards in a drain to reduce force loss, then play them later as needed.  or just play them before you get 3 smugglers out.


Try to make sure they grab somehting other than visored like ICBW or OOC, but if they do grab visored, no sweat.  just be more selective when you play it )


well there you have it.  Once more, major kudos to PCGSAlucard for the deck idea, just for the record I have changed 15 cards from the original design I used, but it still deos pretty much the same stuff, just changed to my style.


Other good cards to use would be 

*another melas to work with tat maul

*endor celeb combo for non combo (no, I dont have it)

*underworld contacts to protectdrains and increase activation.  Actually, I might go add that as soon as I post this.  Not sure what to take out though.

*jedi luke (duh)


This deck is very versatile, it can easily be personalized and changed and still do the same stuff. 

Thx for your time and reviews
