Strategy: '

-UPDATE    That’s supposed to be Luke’s Lightsaber (DSII) x2. Sorry.


-END UPDATE-


NOTE     First Off, Let me say that when I get 2 Jedi Master Qui-Gons, theres replacing the regular Qui-Gons. Second, When I get another Jedi Obi, hell replace the older persona. When that occurs, Obi-Wans Lightsaber from Premiere shall change to have a R3 look, if you catch my drift. When I get 2 Yodas, Master Of Force, Ill replace them for Daughter and Chewie.


Destinys

1 Destiny - 16 cards (Thanks to the 1 Destiny on almost all Jedi except for Ki-Adi-Mundi)

2 Destiny - 5 cards

3 Destiny - 10 cards

4 Destiny - 9 cards

5 Destiny - 7 cards 

6 Destiny - 2 cards

0 Destiny - 2 cards

AVERAGE DESTINY 3.72


Allrighty, heres the STRATEGY. First turn, Hopefully Youll get a Jedi in your hand, if not, pull out what youve got, but make sure youve got a power of around 10 or so. So Lando is what I hope youve got with like Daughter or Chewie, draw for a Jedi, which shouldnt be too hard, (theres 11 Jedis in the deck.) Continue draining and pulling out Jedis, if he/she doesnt want to come to Naboo? Fine, at the Core, with a Jedi & a Lightsaber, theres a drain of 3, at the Generator, 3, Docking Bay, 2, and Courtyard, 2. Thats 10 per turn, not counting if you deploy a Jedi to one of HIS/HER sites.


V.S. Hunt Down

Lost to this, but the deck was somewhat different, his deck had some effects out and he was able to pull out EPP Vader and Maul with only 8 Force, dont ask me how, I dont remember. He killed Qui-Gon Jinn, Jedi Master with his Lightsaber, and sliced him, none the less, he was able to add another destiny to his draws. I lost that battle which basically called the game. But that doesnt mean that the same thing can happen again, I put in Jedis Resisliance and some other cards to balance out that equation. This deck will have preoblems, considering what both decks are made for, I did combat Maul to death later that game, but it was no avail, another Maul came out, with Vader still there, he spread out more characters and Visage conquered the hope.


V.S. Set Your Course

Played against this and won, pulled my Jedis inside the Death Star and drained for 15 per turn, I won by 10. This wasnt a big loss, but I was faced with him destroying Alderaan. This wasnt a real biggie but his retrieval was what caused the low win differential.


V.S. Court Of The Vile Ganster

I used to play it but I must say, I seriously believe Court is finished, its too slow to play and its too hard to pull off. Sorry if this seems like a rant but, I havent seen it in a LONGGGG.        Time.


V.S. Bring Him Before Me

This deck seems to be out too, so many ways not to fullfill it, and it seems to be not used anymore, I say if you did see this, dont pull out Luke and cut up Palpatine, ”$uck it You Sith Master”


V.S. This Deal is Getting Worse All The Time

Allright, I know it seems strange, but I have not played against this before, for this Ill say just pull down your Jedis to the Naboo locations and drain, if needed, pull out Luke, Obi, Mace, and Qui-Gon down on Cloud City and watch your opponent groan as you chop up his characters and laugh.


V.S. ISB Operations

Grrrrr. I hate ISB Operations I played against this and won by 2 He pulled out Probe Droids with Undercover on them, but he had so many sites I was able to drain for 3 per turn and he couldnt drain so it was a slow win. The only drain he had was around turn 20 with Lord Maul and his one sided and lightsaber was draining for 2 per turn.  


Thank You.
