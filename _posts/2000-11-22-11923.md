Strategy: '

Basic strategy
The first thing you do is get Rendeli out of your deck before activation. After this search
for the Executor Docking Bay with your objective. When you are doing this look out for Ephant
Mom. If he’s there pull him with Power Of The Hutt and deploy him at the executor Docking Bay.
Do not deploy him anywhere else unless you get from you opponent more than 2 force. With this
start you’ll activate 10 force on your next turn.

Hidden Base 3th effect will be you Cannot Hide Forever. Dis the effect to get Security
	     Precautions.

Speeders Don’t battle them unless you can win or got Projective Telepathy in your hand.

Profit This is an exception onto the basic strategy. Start with Jabba and Ban Malar.
	1st round deploy Ephant Mom to the Audience Chamber and leave the 1 force for Bane.

Others Just do the basic strategy.
