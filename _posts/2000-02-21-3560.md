Strategy: '

The deck starts out identically to normal Revo decks. Get the nudjs to yavin as soon as you can. Start by drawing a lot. This does several things. It allows you to draw some more locations for activation, it gives a little time for your opponent to deploy something, and it is very likely that you will draw up at least one combo. By combo, I mean like 2 EPPs and the destiny adder between them. Once you have a nice little strike force of cards in your hand, just activate and wait until they deploy something weak. Recycle 5's and 6's to track them for maximum beatdown efficiency. After the first beatdown, just dominate wherever they are, pull in some drains and pretty much stop whatever they do.

Vs. HDADTJ The 3 Transmission Terminated's and 2 spies should be enough to take care of all their Visages. I have glancing blow and courage to protect from dueling, but destinies in this deck are really good too so dueling shouldnt be a huge problem.

Vs. ISB If its drop and drain, just get a DTF/Frozen Assets combo ready and kill them in one hit. Also, unless they're playing space ISB, get Battle Plan out to slow down drains. They won't be getting any force from you, so whatever they use to pay will be from their own icons.

Vs. Raltiir Ops Tantive IV to Raltiir slows them down. Once again, you should be getting a good amount of force, and they will be getting little. In this matchup, its just a matter of saving up, tracking a few destinies and waiting for the right combo. But it can be done.

Vs. DS Space Pile up your guys on the Falcon or Tantive and fly around on a beatdown mission. You can get bunches of destines to wipe out whatever they have. If you have to, drop the CC Lower Corridor and like Orimaarko to drain for 2 every turn.

If you face anything else, the strategy is mostly the same. Have fun '
