*****************************
A big shout out to all those who reviewed this deck the first time, I&#8217;ve taken some  of your suggestions and have ended up with a better deck-THANX

UPDATES

Any Methods Necessary bit it for prepared defenses, I just like the effect better and I can still get another site out to start.  Some more magic bullet effects ended up in there to help combat popular strats.  Flagship Executor took the place of two Death Squad Star Destroyers for the power, ability, and destiny.  Oppressive Enforcement and Grabbers were a must, other than that, this deck still kicks ass in the same manner, and is even more efficient, if that was possible )  Hope you all like this as much as the first one.
******************************

First off, please read the entire strategy section before reviewing, and if you are only going to say "Dark Deal Sucks" or the like, I don't want to hear it.

The starting is usually the Objective, which pulls the Carbonite Chamber and Secret Plans. Use Prepared Defenses to get IAO, Oppressive Enforcement, and Crush.

The deck plays like this, basically first turn, you activate at least three force. During your control phase, peruse your deck with Secret Plans, and get Shocking Revelation if you have it, also if you feel like it, try to determine what three force you activated (I usually can, because I've been playing this deck for quite a while). Deploy the Docking Bay with IAO and use the Objective to pull Bespin, Cloud City, or Dark Deal. Try to get one of the locations, as it provides force generation.  Deploy a third site to Cloud City once you get it and promptly control them as well as the cloud sector to play Dark Deal. Do this all in one turn in order to avoid a beat down. As always, play smart and attempt not to spread too thin. You should always be able to lock down the deal by turn four or five, and flip the Objective by the next turn. Optimally, you will draw a site, a cheap character or two (Ozzel, Blendin, or Merril deploy free, and most others deploy for two) and one of your cloud TIES. With this hand, you should have Dark Deal out second turn. If your opponent deploys something to Cloud City early, be sure clear it out, as you will have a hard time pulling off Dark Deal.

Once you flip, you have some options. In a normal situation, I would be content to drain on Cloud City with the Dark Deal bonus of two, and try to control as many sites as possible with both an alien and an imperial, for the destiny bonus. The power bonus from Dark Deal and the Bespin Cloud City sector will help to keep control of your sites. I don't have much trouble fulfilling Battle Plan either, with the variety of starships in the deck. Of course, when fortifying, balance your deployment to your opponent&#8217;s strategy. This deck has the ability to battle well, especially for light side punks stumbling into Cloud City (be sure to make them pay extra for deployment if you control Bespin). The deck also has the ability for devastating destiny draws, and simple methods of tracking them (Shocking Revelation recycles easily after you pull it from your reserve, as do Masterful Move, Imperial Barrier, Twi'lek Advisor, Dark Maneuvers, A Real Hero, and Evader. All have decent destiny).

---Now I'll list some more specific strategies dealing with certain situations and cards.---

The Carbonite Chamber-Plant Mara or Vader with a stick here and be ready to play All Too Easy. They can hold down the site all by their lonesome. Freezing really isn't hard to pull off, and most decks will go after a lone Vader over a pack of aliens at the Port Town District, for example. That loss of 8 force post-flip can hurt allot, and tends to remove a key character from the battle. Say they deploy EPP Luke and EPP Han. You can freeze either one to reduce their destiny draws, prevent weapon hits, and remove a main character from action.

Battle Order-Chances are, this deck is more balanced than most, and will have no trouble satisfying it. Use it against operatives, hidden base, and other one sided decks.

DS-61-Brothers-These guys are in here because of their cheap deploy and flexibility. I can put them where I need them most.

Bounty Hunter Ships-Pretty efficient cards, and can be used in a wide variety of situations. Also, they are capable of holding down the clouds as well as the systems.

---Now some frequently asked questions.---

Won't Jedi Testing give me problems?-No. First, after looking at the CRD, I was dismayed to find that Jedi Test 1 does in fact cancel my bonus, even after I flip. However, the addition of a Broken Concentration would probably give you the speed edge you need to get those key early drains. Also, MWYHL decks usually go on a beating mission while Luke is hanging out on Dagobah. We're The Bait was made for this situation. It is not that hard to capture or freeze Han, Leia, or Chewie, and once you do, you can use We're The Bait to shut down further testing, and make them lose force. If nothing else, this card is a nice destiny 7.

Why isn't Cloud City Occupation in here?-Well, mainly because I don't own one, but also because I prefer to use non-battleground sites for Dark Deal (Security Tower and Dining Room). You could very easily add it if it suits you.

Why don't I use big blue?-Well, first off, I prefer the interior Cloud City sites. Also, walkers and star destroyers have steep deploy, and I'm looking for speed and efficiency.

Why is this any different from all the other TDIGWATT decks?-Many reasons. First, this one has a comprehensive strategy that I personally wrote for it. Second, I bring unique strategies to a highly repetitive objective, namely All Too Easy, We're The Bait, Dining Room, and cheap characters. Third, I've been playing Dark Deal decks ever since Cloud City came out, and I know the true power of Dark Deal lies in speed and control. Other decks just don't accomplish these goals as efficiently as this one.

---Some pairing scenarios.---

Hidden Base-This deck fades in and out in my area, and currently is out. A Security Precautions is all this deck needs to combat Hidden Base, and you will always have the speed advantage.  9 times out of 10 you can probe their base.  If they are simply using the objective for force generation, this is a bit more of a problem.  Using Dark Deal and my good mix of ships, I can usually hold my own and drain &#8216;em out.  Menace Fades is annoying to say the least, but speed really helps.

MWYHL-I can't stress enough the importance of speed in this deck, which will triumph over testing every time. Give the We're The Bait strategy a try, too.  I haven&#8217;t played a Dagobah turtle in ages, so in response to Terron&#8217;s review, I chose not to modify my strategy to counter it.  AFA falls to projective telepathy, which I can swap in for the barriers depending on meta.

Operatives-These decks, especially for the lightside, are becoming less and less common. If they do become prevalent, add Leave Them To Me, which totally destroys operatives. You again will have a speed advantage.

Profit-Don't bother putting any aliens out to start, just focus on getting set up at Cloud City. You can out drain, out damage, and out battle them as long as you stay on your turf.	Profit decks don&#8217;t have the amazing drain potential you have, and are usually low on space, giving you free reign up there.  Use battle order to your advantage as well.

Rescue The Princess-You are WAY too fast for this. They aren&#8217;t doing anything for a few turns, and they give you three extra force What a deal Even on the flip side, they have to come to you, because you will have the drain advantage.	These decks can&#8217;t do jack vs. me unless they come a knockin&#8217;.  I have never seen a good version of this deck in my area except mine, so when it does catch on, put a Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down in there-great tech.

Rebel Strike Team-They will tend to stick to Endor, all the better for you, because you win a drain race.  This deck is far from common, I&#8217;m waiting for someone to build one based around strike planning.  &#8216;til then, I&#8217;m not too worried.

There Is Good In Him-This ain't too hard. Ignore them till they come a knocking, and then start rocking. It would be sweet if you managed to kill the Jedi with aliens, but this is unlikely. Capturing him with Vader is your best bet, and We're The Bait also works here too to make them lose force if you manage to freeze Han, Leia, or Chewie. If you want to be really nasty, put in a couple Human Shields, and kill Luke that way.	As an answer to speeder decks, they might take you by surprise, but your sites are mostly interior, how about that.

Throne Room Choke-Crush The Rebellion was made to combat this deck. You sites are all better for you, and Evader totally shuts down revos.  This deck relies on an activation jump, but you have no prob with activation in this deck.	At worst, this stalls your speed a bit.

Assorted other mains and toys-If all else fails, use Dark Deal and retreat back into the corridors of Cloud City. You will always have the advantage on home turf.

Thank you very much for reading my lengthy strategy, and please rate this deck with any helpful comments you can think of.
