Strategy: '

This deck always sets up fast, I don;t want to flip
the objective until i have a strangle hold on space.
Which is pretty easy with all the X-wings, I try to
get out 'Bacta tank' 'order to engage' 'Rebel Fleet'
and 'Doc&repair facility' before i flip i then spread out
and drain - I can spread out pretty thin with the hyper e
escapes and rebel barriers. I set up heavy on Yavin 4 the mon cal's with Haven
can be deadly. The few pilots i have are low deploy and high
forfeit. The mains are just to deploy on the ground and mess things
up, after that throw them in the bacta tank. I really enjoy this deck
I can go up against any deck no problem - raltir ops presents some problems
but i usually dominate them in space. Sec precautions isn't that big a deal
I usually wipe out anyone in space prior to them being able to probe (the 3 X-wing assualt sqauds+organized attack+Doc&repair facility
