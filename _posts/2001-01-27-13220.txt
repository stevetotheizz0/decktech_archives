Strategy: 

		How to be a succesful Jailer

Ok, the deck idea revolves around the use of the DS jail to capture people and make sure that they never see the light of day again.  now before you skip straight to the bottom and give me an @#$% rating for using the DS jail, hear me out.  this jail is the only jail in the game that doesnt let the light side release captives via its own text. ex: CC jail lets you release prisoners instead of draining, the JP jail lets you pay to release if you control.  the DS jail doesnt let them release guys unless they are packing the cards to do it. in laymans terms: no 8D8,im here to rescue you, DS:jail control room, etc, means once they get tossed in the clink, they aint comin out, effectively putting them out of play.

the setup is similar to most SCYFA decks- activate a bunch of force, grab your sites then run your game plan.  IAO/mob points, YCHF is here to fight #’s and whack jedi but mostly to grab S&D to make them come to you.  the executor DB is there for a safe first turn place for Dr E/Jodo/Boba/whoever.  the other DB’s are for getting to whereever the opponent is and to drain when they refuse to come fight fair (as fair as the dark side can be). same goes for the CHYBC/presence of the force.

blast door controls/all wrapped up/bounty all help you accomplish your goals easier (read the cards and you’ll get it).  the controls are for the mad space drains you might encounter (esp at your own death star).  mandalorian battle armor is awesome- put it on Dr E and ponda boobies (who exactly is wearing it, i wonder?) prince XXX or even dengar.  with that, most of your characters will be somewhat difficult to hit, being at least defence value 4-6. and that is just one more person who can hidden weapons (wee! gotcha suckas!).

i realize that it is really weak in space, but i couldnt find any ships to add without radically changing the deck. if anyone has any ideas, by all means let me know.

matchups:

EBO: this is where you get mauled. period. but hardly anyone plays this in my area any more (WYS is huge here).

TIGIH: dont capture luke, just kill him w/the hunters, then capture people and let S&D do its job.

WYS: again, S&D is a huge hook up here. the fact that they get a zillion destinies isnt that bad- just whack one/operate/capture/la-di-da-di-da. the only activate one at nonBG sites isnt that bad- by the time they flip, you should be at at least one BG docking bay. it is retarded when the Death star only gives you one, however.

MWYHL: S&D, i suppose that you could even go to dagobah and snag the jedi school- fun fun! i havent played against one of these tho.

AITC: if speeders, stay inside! if not, capture their guys,  yadda yadda yadda.

Profit: yeah, whatever.

well, thats about all i can think of for now. any helpful ideas and constructive criticism would be delightful, and above all have fun throwin people in the heartbreak hotel.

ps. while typing your submission, whatever you do dont hit escape- it will erase everything you wrote! i was half way thru my strat when i hit escape and deleted all of it. mother@#$%ing peice of @#$% hobag @#$% @#$% thang! anyhow, now youve been warned.
