Strategy: '

This is probably the best balanced recurring mains drazin deck that can be made.	It covers all the basics for counters.	the we have a prisoners are anti-noble sacrifice tech so you can get another captive to continue recurring.  the occupation is another form of damage for stuff like numbers and other non-interactive decks.  this deck is solid.'
