Strategy: '

When starting a game with this deck it is very important to get Vader out as soon as possible...hopefully first turn.  If they give you one force start Security Precautions so if you have Vader you can deploy him right away.  If they start something that gives you two force start Bad Feeling.  It depends their starting stuff so act accordingly.  To win with this deck it quite simple.  Get Vader out and keep Visage alive.  If you get 1st turn Vader to any of your locations you hit them quick and hard. The supplies are for obviously force activation.  Gettling them early really helps but in late game situations are useless.  This deck over time hardly ever looses due to it's flexability. TJ Holman & I played a version of it that won us the Ramapo Team Toruney in Coruscant.  Try it out. '
