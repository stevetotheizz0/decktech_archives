Strategy: '

sorry about the strangeness of the strategy but something went wrong with the srtat                 


this deck sets up like a well organized drug bust. 
                 on the first turn (force impending)I pull 
                 (and deploy) crix, who pulls his CoK who pulls
                 wuta who pulls a site i can also pull back door and
                 bunker (i get a force because TSID). If i have enough 
                 force which is xtremely doughtful I pull genaral 
                 calrissian who pulls GS1. Anyways Even if I dont
                 do 
                 all those steps I will still have plenty of 
                 activation on turn 2 where I pull more sites 
                 and scouts. by turn 3 or 4 I will be set up for 
                 flip when I flip I send scouts into bunker and use 
                 the +4EE bonus and a charge to blow it away. If
                 the 
                 druggys come to the bunker ill blow them
                 straight 
                 to hell with concussion gernade or a charge.
                 once I 
                 clean out the bunker I spread out in my grace
                 turn 
                 (they have no hand) and drain. the game should
                 be 
                 quick after that because of the force swing and
                 O.K. 
                 drains at Endor. this deck isnt a battling 
                 powerhouse on ground or space but i have good

                 enough forces to maintain what i need to of both

                 places (8 destiny 6and7s help). 
                 Why 3 different AOs? even people on crack can 
                 see that lots of AOs R compatible w/scouts 
                 concentate all fire=scouts immune <6 better 
                 weapond draws 
                 capital support=give enemy capital punishment
                 with 
                 xtra force loss 
                 taking with us=cheaper deploy, harder to hit etc. 



                 Thanks for reviewing this deck 
                 it will beat all druggies (if they R high)
