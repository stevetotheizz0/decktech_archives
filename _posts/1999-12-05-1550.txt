Strategy: '

Use TatOcc to get an avenue of force loss that can't be cancelled. Defend Tatooine with the Big E, BiHT, the 2 DSSDs, and for more power, there's always the pilots in the deck.

On Tatooine, you can muck around with dumping out characters. Unless the other guy plans on playing on other planets and not coming to Tatooine, you need to get a destiny draw at each site. Group obvious combo's together.

Against Ops Use Bubo. After he's eaten one operative go in with some wipers and clean out the site. Remember they can't do nuts about TatOcc unless they deploy on your planet.

Against MWYHL Same. Use TatOcc to get force loss, then wait for them to come. Some characters and vehicles in this deck can react, so make full use of that. Oh yeah, and if the EPPs come, you can *try* to capture them with Dengar's Mod Riot Gun. Use Broken Concentration as your starting effect too.
