Strategy: 

I have never played this deck but it seems good.
First turn before you activate pull carida then pull death star war room and executor docking bay
This gives you a minimum of 10 force second turn plus iif you get some guys to the docking bays you can activate 14 force plus whatever the opponet gives you plus whatever is in your hand this is not hard to do with the Imperial Commands you can pull ozzel deploy him free to a docking bay then deploy another guy to the other.After all that and your gnerating tons of force you can play it like a mains deck. This deck has the capibility to drain or battle witch is why i think it is good.

Matchups

Against mind what you have learned
This deck is very popular in my area I think it is very easy to beat.All you have to do is get out come here you big coward and secret plans and start draining like mad at the 2-2 sites once they get to test 5 they have to pay 10 force or they don’t retreive usualy they don’t have enogh force left to do it.If you really wan’t to srew them up becuase they have enough force left to retriev play the omnie box before they attempt test 5 and laugh at them when they get a 1 or 0 on the test.

Against Profit
Start with mara jade and iggy becuase they are the only aliens in the deck devote everything you have to stopping them get secret plans out ASAP or you can start with it in stead of oppresive enforcment if you want.If they are playing eloms get serch and destroy out and start causing some damage to them just never let them flip and they will lose if they do flip they have to pay 10 force to retreiv or it is canceled.

Against There is good in him
Be more carful abuot the docking bay because they can get to the death star and start winning battles.Pick up luke early in the game fortify his site and pick your battles carfully so they don’t turn vader.If they play there deck in space then drain on the ground cause they probaly have a strategy to win battles in space.If they are on the ground drain in space.You can still battle just pick your battles carfuly and dont leave yourself vunarable to a beatdown.

Against hidden base
Drain on the ground deploy your ships to space after they flip and probe this is a e xtremely easy game.
