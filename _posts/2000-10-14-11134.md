Strategy: '

This deck has a great balance of space, ground, and retreiving cards. Start with main power generators, north ridge, and a new secret base. It is easy to set up EBO and start draining and battling your opponent to death. Use the signal to get incom corporation on one of your interior hoth sites. If you donâ€™t know what incom corp. does, it makes your x - wings and speeders power + 1 and gives them an ability 2 pilot. If your opponent comes to hoth to set up decree, that is no problem. Just activate your maneuvering flaps and beatdown with speeders. Only two speeders boosted with incom corp. and flaps has a total power of 12 plus destiny Just think of the potential with a whole fleet of speeders... Also use the bargawins and on the edge to retreive your weapons and devices. The reason I use the piece of junk commander luke is because I am able to get him from reserve. Pull Echo Base Garrasion from reserve using a new secret base, and that allows you to get (hoth)luke. Put him at an echo site, and he makes your flaps immune to alter and gives you a rebel of ability > 2 for the purpose of on the edge. Vs. BHBM just deploy him at the docking bay and throw him to your opponent. This deck is great for beating down your opponents who just assume EBO decks are weak on ground. The combonation of speeders, incom corp., and flaps is unstoppable.
