Strategy: 

First I need to start out with AELOMBT, Inconsequential Losses, and Crossfire.
Getting these using prepared defences really starts me out with a good defence.
I then need to be able to deploy as many locations as I can, starting with the Prefect’s Office to power up my imperials from the start.
Simply, once the locations are down, I take control of them and make sure I am able to draw battle destiny at every site.
With the Objective adding at least 5 to my battle destiny, it is easy to hold my locations.
I make sure to get my Elites their Blaster rifles as soon as possible and take advantage of Crossfire and the power bonuses it gives them.
During most games My Stormtroopers get to be about power 3 and my Elites to power 5 on Raltiir.
My true goal though is to use the ability to get out any card to get Vader, Tarkin, Commander Igar in Tempest 1, Davod Jon, Tagge, and an Elite all down to one site.
I then use Dark Jedi Presence to Overkill with a maximum power (excluding battle destiny)of 56.
And not having to worry about being force drained for much can ensure that I have my forces spread to the best advantage.
