Strategy: '

Speeder Ops , the quickest way for LS draining
kills. This is another Alien version so you don't
have to worry too much about Drazin. Though it doesn't
look like much the Flaps and Ops bonuses will help
this deck fight its way out of tough situations.
Here we go for specific strategy 

v. DS Ops- The quick deploy of this deck is very
good versus DS Ops. The bonuses you have on them
is the ability to use Lost in the Wilderness and
Landing Claw to get around Battle Order. A quick
T-47 shot will help tip the game in your favor.
Ithorians will give you the chance to drain for
a good amount if ABC2theUni is on you.

v. Big Blue- Use the Landing Claw trick to get
around Battle Order. Things might get hairy if
ABC is out. Use It's A Traps and Houjix if they
bring too much of a smackdown at one site.

v. ISB- Use Lost in the Wilderness on 5D6. Worrt
will help eat the other agents here and there.
Tantive IV and Spiral and the Leaders will help
try to fight off ABC.

v. Drazin - Having NO Rebels is gonna seperate
the average Drazin deck from the really really
good ones. Basically just spread and drain ; try
to track the higher destinies to get around any
immunity their aliens might have.

v. Ralltiir Ops - hehe. You get to watch them cringe.
They'll never be able to flip and since you have
no Rebels you'll be able to battle with no hindrances.
Harc Seff will help if they actually manage to
control a site.

v. TIEs - The Z-95 will help Landing Claw a Dreadnaught
and you can maybe surprise them with Tantive IV
and a leader or something. Aim High will make them
pay to retrieve and should be a game where you win
with your better drain capabilities.

v. HDADTJ - Cancel Visage , stay away from Vader
and try to Lost in the Wilderness him. Drain , Drain
, Drain.

v.Ominous Rumors - Landing Claw will help cancel two
drains. Pulling off T-47 will also help win the game.
This deck plays pretty much the same way every game.

Miscellaneous notes  This is a pretty solid deck
and shouldn't be too hard to play. Yargna helps
versus Monnok and as long as you can get out the anti-Elis
Insurrection you'll be fine. '
