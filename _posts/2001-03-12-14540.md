Slowly build up a force, drop down and kill, kill, kill.  Plays the same against nearly all decks.


Reasons for cards


Cantina and Farm Build forces up here, retrieve and drain. 


Nabrun Move to where they are.


Order to Engage If they have IAO, Nabrun during move phase and dare them to retaliate.


Ounee Ta Card advantage/retrieval, anti-NSP, anti-Rops.

Corrections

  My mistake, should be TJ, not Sokol


Basically you build a force at the Cantina/Farm, force them to come after you and beat them down. 2 times in 3 games I had over 100 battle damage.  If they don’t want to fight, that’s what Nabrun/OTE is for, just chase them, and the can’t do anything.
