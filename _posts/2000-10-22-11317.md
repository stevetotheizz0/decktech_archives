Strategy: '

This deck forally used Baragwins, but it stunk.

My starting effects are normally squadron assignments, strike planning, your insight serves you well.

Wedge awesome on ground and land

LSJK with annie’ stick and alone is a monster

Gen. Carl takes with strike planning and is awesome in ship

Lt. Blout and Craken  put in their ship for strike planning or use to kill ISB

Wuta site searcher

Corp. Midge force drain adder

Crix strike planning and scout searcher

Corp. Ken =2 deploy for bad guys

Brooks Landspeed 2 and adds imunity

COK take able with Gen. Crix

Tycho Celchu spy and pilot

Greeve and Page good scouts

Insertion Planning it’s good. 5 works don’t laugh

A280 is awesome

Well ya get out Gen.s With strike planning. Then get out COK, he gets Wuta, Wuta gets sites , you control sites, you flip You win.

Deck by Deck

Ralitair Get Close Air Support and then deploy to endor. When ya flip. Your force drains may not be modified or canceled. Then force dain them for the win.

Hunt Down Close Air Support is awesome if they give you a full-fledged assault. Wait with Obi and Luke with stick until they lose duel cards. Drain and run, then battle. Play smart.

 Court get Honor out then drain don’t go there. If they want you they got to come to you.
Close air will make sure trhey don’t get the upper hand on Endor.

BHBM kill vader with Close Air Support and your non Luke souts then go kill E.P.
Easy

Endor Ops.  Ha The second feature of IP will kill them if they are bikers. Close air is just going to give them no chance.

This deck is fun and good. Be smart and you will win.)
