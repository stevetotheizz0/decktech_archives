Strategy: 

	All of the non-ISB characters can draw battle destiny by themselves.  The exceptions to this is Gen. Tagge, for the Imperial City, and AT-ST Pilot for his awesomeness on AT-STs.  Yes, I know I need IAO, but I dont have it yet.  Im planning on replacing Thunderflare w/ Veangence and adding in a Coruscant.  I also want to put in another Ice Storm.  Once I get it, Im also replacing He Is Not Ready w/ Broken Concentration.
	Oppressive Enforcement is for SAC protection, as well as helping the low destiny in my deck.
	3 Advisors help you get out the effects.
	I also might add Fozec and Oberk if I can get them.
If you tell me to put something in, tell me what to take out for it.
Thanx!

Oh, I forgot.  I'm also going to put in Rebel Base Occupation and Imperial Decree if I can get them.
