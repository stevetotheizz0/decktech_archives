Object of deck:
This is a standard drop-and-drain deck.  Hopefully you'll be able to pull sites rapidly, and then start dropping the ORSs.  The ORSs piloting the independent starships helps probe Hidden Bases, and protects the Occupation from being cancelled via opponent controlling Tatooine.	Drop the Ghhhks at the Imperial Holotable for a meager drain and to protect them from being Grimtaashed away, but be wary of your opponent playing Transmission Terminated.
Force retrieval engine is Scum And Villainy when initiating battles and Abyssin Ornament on the ORSs.
