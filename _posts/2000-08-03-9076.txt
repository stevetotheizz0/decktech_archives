Strategy: '

To begin, I have to give tons of credit to my boy Jared Napolitano and his awesome Light Side deck, 'The Machine.'  Obviously, the starting interrupt is Heading For The Medical Frigate in order to deploy Insurrection, Staging Areas, and another effect to counter your opponent's strategy.  You can deploy the Endor Laning Platform on your first turn to facilitate destiny stacking with your ASP-707s and Ewok Catapults.  The ability to draw a destiny of seven at any time is extremely useful in a variety of situations (On The Edge, Off The Edge, Thank The Maker, Fallen Portal, weapon destiny, battle destiny).  '
