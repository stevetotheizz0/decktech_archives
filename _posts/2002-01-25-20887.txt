Theres the deck.

    ..... here’s the strategy.





'

Strategy: '

Well, I hope I haven’t offended any Mexicans out there, but since I’m Mexican, I can make fun of em all I want. =-)

So, all those Mexicans {senators} do there thing in the senate.

Use Squabbling Delegates, and the higher number of senators to attempt to flip first turn.

Use IAO to get DSII DB out first turn.

Use Lotti Doddi to get out good sh1t from your force pile {its like having a Backlash deck from WWF}.

The Point Is Conceded is a nice used trackable destiny 6, which also lets you activate 1 force.

Yeb Yeb, is the freken man. Use him every turn you can, instant 1D to there deck every time, only time not to use it, is when they have a 1 for a destiny, and your going to battle.

Tikkes helps out against Honor.

Baskol provides a little extra damage when need be.

Aks Moe can be a fill in guy if need be, cuz hes a 3/3, and a 2/5, which is always good.

Hope ya like the deck.
