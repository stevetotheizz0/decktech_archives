Theres the deck.

    ..... here’s the strategy.







Strategy: 

Well, I hope I haven’t offended any Mexicans out there, but since I’m Mexican, I can make fun of em all I want. =-)

So, all those Mexicans {senators} do there thing in the senate.

Use Squabbling Delegates, and the higher number of senators to attempt to flip first turn.

Use IAO to get DSII: DB out first turn.

Use Lotti Doddi to get out good sh1t from your force pile {its like having a Backlash deck from WWF}.

The Point Is Conceded is a nice used trackable destiny 6, which also lets you activate 1 force.

Yeb Yeb, is the freken man. Use him every turn you can, instant 1D to there deck every time, only time not to use it, is when they have a 1 for a destiny, and your going to battle.

Tikkes helps out against Honor.

Baskol provides a little extra damage when need be.

Aks Moe can be a fill in guy if need be, cuz hes a 3/3, and a 2/5, which is always good.

Hope ya like the deck.
