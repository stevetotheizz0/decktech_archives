Strategy: '

There is no need to podrace when you have such a high power

the twix are for activation since you don’t have mob point anymore.

you absolutly destroy the oponent, he can’T do anything. he is choke ( you give him 1 force ) and you god bad feeling.

You absolutly Over Power Him anywhere he goes. and you have I have you now. track, and its machine 

We tried averything, there is no way to beat that deck... its huge 

Yannick almost manage to win, but With a battle damage of 13 on a loci Rosen ( the guy that got power equal to the number of card you got in yur hand)  I won by 15

Well I must go to scool now, I will write more startegy later
