Strategy: 

Basically the same as most other ROPs decks out there. Get the DBs for massive generation, and wait until you can deploy everything at once for the flip. Then get Palpy down to Ralltiir with OIP to boost your drains. Use CHYBC against MWYHL; no force retrival for them! Use Decree against EBO, and just take on everyone else. There's always the problems with the anti-ROPs decks and Turbo-Profit, but it's still an extremely viable deck. Oh, and I want to thank all the folks out there with ROPs decks who inspired me. This deck is a major ripoff, and I couldn't have done it without them.
