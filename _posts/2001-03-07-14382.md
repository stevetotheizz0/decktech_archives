There is no try & Oppressive Enforcement 



First Turn, deploy Cloud City East Platform.  Use Crush to get either I Have You Know or Evader & Monnok. 


Here’s the tech, set up at the Chasm Walkway. Use Vader, Mara, Boba, Dengar, and Dr. E & Ponda to send characters to the Weather Vane. Here is why I like to play with the Weather Vane. During battle, I can get rid of a lot of high power/ability/battle destiny adding characters. Send them to the vane to get rid of them. This is tech for battles. Also, characters on the vane can’t be re-deployed. It’s nice to have Han sitting on the vane and not running around. 


Also, use Shattered Hope to send characters flying to the Weather Vane.  If you win a battle and Jedi Luke is still hanging around, just send him to the weather vane.


Evader and Monnok allows you to keep a control over the opponent’s hand. 


I have 2 grabbers. Use those to get Harvest (first priority), The Bith Shuffle & Desperate Reach (Second), and other cycling cards. Most players play with The Bith Shuffle & Desperate reach because they can use the card to cancel Imperial barrier or shuffle reserve decks. That’s good. If they play it to shuffle a reserve deck, grab the card. That stops the opponent from getting characters off of the weather vane. 


Sniper does make the characters lost, not sent to the weather vane (sniper card is the top action), but it does add 3 to lightsaber draws. That can help for an Obi-Wan, Luke, Leia W/, Chewie w/, ect. 


I have removed Han from Watch Your Step decks.  This deck can also remove other key characters as well by having them sit on the weather vane.  


If you want, give Han to jabba and have him, Xizor, Guri and 4-lom chill together.  Jabba can’t be hit because of Xizor.  Xizor can’t be hit because of Guri.  There will then be 3 destinies in that battle.  Nasty little group holding on to Han. 


Don’t worry about flipping.  That is just a trap to get you off of Cloud City.  Just stay there and drain. '
