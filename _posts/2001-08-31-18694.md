Strategy: '

***UPDATE*** Podracing hurts, so throw in an it Could Be Worse and take out a Falcon.  I know the risk involved in using that card, but its the simplest way to avoid race damage.  Also, Im considering using Naboo with amidala to retrieve lots of force (thanks Steve), but giving away 3 force at the start is kind of bad.  LMK what you think is the best path to try.***END UPDATE***


First off I must explain the title.  In the Simpsons episode where a bear runs rampant in Springfield, Homer wonders why his paycheck has money taken out for a bear tax (when the bear is gotten rid of).  He tells Lisa the title of the deck and she responds with No Dad, thats the home-owner tax.  Funny quote from the best show ever.  Anyway, on with the deck....


In the post-Coruscant environment, DS Senate deck are very popular mainly due to the insane benefits you get from having a Senate majority.  Lott Dod makes any combo viable, Tikkes gives you massive activation and cancels Honor, and the list goes on.  As I was pondering a solution to this problem, I figured why not try and beat them at their own game?


Thus, the idea for this LS seante deck was born.  As I was flipping through the LS senators I noticed one common theme.  Balance.  The LS Senators are meant for decks which can hold both space and ground, and if these goals are accomplished, you get some really good benefits.  Anyway here is the strategy behind the deck.


You always start with Insurrection/Aim High and Squads while the 3rd effects is YiSyW/SA or DoDN/WA depending on what deck you face.  Use Mindful of the Future to get out the Tatooine system early and Might of the Republic to pull Senators to flip quickly as well.  Get out all 3 docking bays with the spaceport one going to Tatooine and try to establish space when the time is right.  You should flip 3rd turn at the latest, and with all the benefits provided to you by the Senators, you shouldnt have a problem keeping control of the system, and the mains can hold down the sites with relative ease.  Get out ITTL to add to drains at the Docking Bays and make your ships tougher to kill.  Signal for helpful effects and remember all the benefits your objective gives you.  The 2 political effects add to drains and prevent them also.  Always use the 3 force to make them put back 2 cards unless you really need the force that badly.  Once you have control of the system, the game should roll along, and with BP/DTF and Menace Fades, you can establish a lock on the opponent.  Now for some specifics


Locations Starting the chamber gives you a solid base of force generation.  SpaceportDB to make deployment cheaper.  No Escape is a possible problem, but I might sub it out for the new Mos Espa one to avoid that so let me know your stance on the issue.  The Hoth DB is to get around the popular RoC/MAiH combo which is prevalent nowadays.  Id like to throw in another system to drain at as well, so if you have any ideas, LMK.


Characters All the helpful mains and I prefer built-in sabers on the mains.  Coruscant Yoda can be pulled with the chamber 1st turn to add to actiavtion and protect it as well.  I picked who I thought were the best pilots to hold Tatooine and everyone else except the senators can hold down the 2 DBs or make surgical strikes on the opponent.  The Guard can help maintain control in the Senate.  Since most people are not aware of the capabilities of the LS Seantors, Ill list them here


Senator Palpatine 4 Politics and can add your opponents battle destiny number to your power in battle once per turn.


Valorum 5 Politics and can cancel battle destinies in battles involving Qui-Gon.


Sei Taria 3 Politics and when with Valorum adds 1 to your generation, and makes drains +1 at BG systems when you control a BG site as well.


Mas Amedda 3 Politics and is the key guy in the deck and the only one I might consider playing 2 of.  Also adds 1 force generation when with Valorum, and once during your control phase, opponent loses 2 force if you OCCUPY...not control a BG site and a BG system which is easy in this deck.


Liana Merian 2 Politics and if opponent doesnt save 2 force each turn, their battle destiny is a 0 unless they lose 2 force.  She is a walking I Did It.


Yarua 2 Politics and every time you drain at a BG system, you retrieve a force and can also help hold the senate by reducing a DS Senator with wealth agendas Politics by 2.


Horox Ryyder 2 Politics and opponent only draws 1 destiny in battles at systems.  Nuff said.


As you can see, you get some pretty nice benefits from the LS Senators.


Weapons 2 Qui-Gons so why not his saber?


Admirals Orders add to your drains on the ground, makes your ships tougher to kill with attrition, and saves your ships as well.


Starships The best the LS has to offer.  2 Falcons because its still the best ship around, and the other 3 are nice with their matching pilots.


Interrupts Might pulls Senators and Mindful pulls the Tatooine system and then stays as a 5 destiny when you need it or you just lose it to a drain.  Signals pull effects, Vote Now gets you the cards you need quicker, New Leadership Is Needed can help get rod of Lott Dod or any other annoying DS Senator.  I Know is awesome with EPP Leia on the Falcon and OOC/TT is a nice utility card which can cancel Visage or the Phantom Menace and also can remove key characters from the game with a little luck.


Effects 2 grapplers because theyre always useful and Civil Disorder combines well with the objective and also hurts HD which has few characters in it.  Plea to the Court can cancel a drain while I Will Not Defer adds to our own.  BP/DTF and Menace Fades are 2 integral parts of any balanced deck.  I want to fit Honor in here, so LMK what you think I can take out.


I want to get in another senator and another BG system as well, so LMK what you think can be taken out for them.


The deck has worked out well in playtesting so far, but Im interested to see what everyone thinks of what Ive come up with here.  Maybe the LS Senate has some possiblities, and I believe this deck shows that.  Any suggestions are welcome and feel free to dmail or email me if you have any other questions about the deck.
