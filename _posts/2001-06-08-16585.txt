Strategy: 

Response to reviews: Sorry I don’t have Qui-Gon, I don’t have him and my @#$%in friend won’t let me borrow him.


Deck Change: I just counted my deck after writing the list and found only 59 cards, so I added an Orri. There is now and Orri in this deck.
OK like I said, this deck is undefeated, against ground, space, and decks with both. I beat my friends SYC big drains in space, and won because of drains. I also beat my friend BHBM swarm deck by 35. I really like the podracing boost in the beginning (+12 force swing) which I have won every game because of my huge destinies. Anyway, this deck lets them go to the chamber first to stop Han from being unfrozen. You draw and use Tunnel Vision for first 1-3 turns till you get a hit crew (Ben, Luke, Lando, and others). Activate and save, then either deploy the hit crew to beat them up, or just put them there to unfreeze Han and retreive. 
Card Choices:
Losing Track x3: This is a high destiny, plus damaging their racer or repairing mine, also trackable. 
Noble Sacrifice/I Can’t Believe He’s Gone: Lose Obi-Wan to noble sacrifice, retrieve 9, and get power 5 anywhere.

Matchups:
I won’t go into the specific objective matchups, but I will tell about decktypes.

Space: Spread out and drain and make them lose to Profit. A very tough matchup, though with all of the retrieval, shouldn’t be too hard. I won this game by 10.

Ground Beatdown: Let them have the chamber, then come down w/a hit squad and beat the crap out of them. With hit squads I have won battle by 14 and 18, which won the game for me. If they don’t want the chamber, go there and get Han and retrieve, then drain.

Aliens: Start The Camp, and do basically the same thing as before. Get the hit squad to the chamber and lay the SMACK down.

This deck is a very fun deck to play, and doesn’t have many weaknesses. Thanks for taking the time to review this, the future world champ, Phil
