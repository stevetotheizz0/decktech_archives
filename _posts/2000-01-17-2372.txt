Strategy: 

This is a quite basic ISB deck i suppose, with no special to explain. What I see as a main threat is very heavy beat down, but it should be able to handle that as well. Opperatives is obvious - a bright center + an ISB agent there. Then slowly drain him in space if he's got beatdown in it, otherwise you can use the ground drain places as well. Hidden base should be no problems with lots of ships, and characters with big forfeit. Try to be able to grapple his expected interrupts such as barriers and hyper escapes asap. How to handle other decks you have to think of yourself.

I didn't test this deck, i don't build dark decks at the moment since i'm perfectly satisfied with my raltiir deck (i built the clint hays hunt down deck last week but it really wasn't that good as everyone says it is). Therefore i'm not 100% sure it works as it's supposed to, but i think it has potentials!

have a ball with it!
