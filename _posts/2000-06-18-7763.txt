Strategy: 

  When playing this deck, it is important to never attack alone.  Try to use at least two or three characters when attacking.	If going against a lone character, or even a group of two, use hidden weapons to take out one, either canceling the battle or preventing battle destiny.
   The ability to place characters out of play with the creatures is incredible against any deck.
   When playing a Hidden Base, use your starships wisely and quickly get the base.  U can use Mara and the Mist Hunter to deploy where there is no force icons if necessary.
   Use fett for bounties when possible, jodo is great with dengar's gun, and use sense to prevent choke on him.
   When this deck is played correctly it is nearly impossible to beat.	Please make any suggestions that could be made to help me perfect it.
