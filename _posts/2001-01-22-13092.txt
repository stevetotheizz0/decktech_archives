Strategy: 

well the deck is different really
get rendili & chamber out on youre 1st turn, you get 8 on second turn + what he gives you..not bad...then docking bays & activate at them......start with ig or 4-lom moving the prize on turn 1 if possible or turn 2 at least....they cant be battled & will flip the obj without having need of back up...then you have imps so no scum......BUT you are still imune to <4 if in space with the ships or some such....the deck is strong..but i would recommend changing it for meta.....i personally am trying to fit in 3 grabbers for my reagion is very inturupt abusive

i DONT USE SCUM cause it makes jabba’s prize & the obj hard to keep on table.but if i just use the droid & stay away from blasters & such.....i can keep it fliped &  i retrive one a turn & get the imunity bonuses......i’s worth it & scum too much trouble
this deck wont hold at the worlds but it is fun in a small tounrey & just enjoy..cause it has power where it counts.....
