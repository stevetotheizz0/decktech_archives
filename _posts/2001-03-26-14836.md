Strategy: '

I started with the @#$%ty objective for only 1 purpose to pull your lands and to search your deck for what you are looking for. I used to play with Dagobah just for searching, it really helps.

Although it sucks for tracking you really don’t need to with this deck.


Why Swamp Easy 4 force to initiate a battle simple enough. Usually your hand will always start with an imperial and either Overseeing it personnaly or Necklace. Those two cards are the deck. Immediately deploy an imperial and start the drains. Don’t worry about them battling you the first or second turns they will not have enough force. Immediately search for Palpy LOCATE him and deploy him as soon as possible. Try to figure what type of deck they are playing with to see if you can spread out or have a little power stacked up. I have only lost a couple games with this deck but the main thing is Palpy RULES


Why Alter/SenseI found out less and less people are playing with these cards, why not bring them back. Also people are playing less with Do or Do Not/Wise Advise your choice. I hate Asteroid Sanctuary and Goo Nee Tay.


Why Ommni Box & It’s Worse I hate counters, mess with their head. It’s worse is always a surprise for huge loss of force.


Space EAZY they are dead. Give them about 6 or 7 turns.


Ground Unless they are playing with speeders no trouble. Weak pathetic fools.


Cards to watch out for Ounee Ta; Menace Fades; Damn undercover spies.


Some considerations Try using Sniper cards maybe instead of bith shuffles.  '
