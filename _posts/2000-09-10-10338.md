Strategy: '

------------------ Update Take out Incom Engineer for Insurrection -----------------

Basically you set up testing to 3 by starting Wise Advice, Insurrecton, and Staging Areas and/or The Way of Things depending on the deck. Then you pull the Hoth docking bay on turn 1 and set up Yoda with Luke at the hut and start testing. Put Incom Corporation on Hoth Docking Bay and beat the opponent wherever he goes. If they're in space, claw their ships and drain on the ground. Projections, Test 1, and the undecover spies should slow their drains down at interior sites. ASP droids can put your speeders back into your deck in the late game. Will have huge problem against space decks but you can still win if you play smart. '
