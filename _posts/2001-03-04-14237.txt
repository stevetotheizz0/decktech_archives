Strategy: '

I frogot to put in Rendevous Point in switch it with an x-wing.

The basic strategy of this deck is to prevent all or near all damage done to you, drain the heck out of your enemy in space, and attack on the ground. I start with Heading TTF Staging Areas and Insurrection. 

Here are some strategies agenst other decks
BHBM
Let Luke Be Captured Drain At Home 1 DB, and swarm X-wings in space, get rebal fleet and stop drains, maybe try to attck them, but dont let em win battles.

Court
Get out Honor and build up space, flip and if needed attack.

SYCFA
Kill em in space if possible, this will be a pretty fun match up.

Endor Ops Space
Read SYCFA. 


I hope you enjoy my first Hidden Base Deck...
