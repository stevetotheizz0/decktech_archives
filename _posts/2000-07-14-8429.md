Strategy: '

First, you get out kiffex quick. Then you take The docking bay into hand with imperial arrest order. Put an op on kiffex and take out another site with him. Get out all three sites, get out your ISB agents and ops to every <> site and have a drain of nine pretty quick. Then you can just drain them out and use vader and mara to hurt them other places.

VS. HB, set up as normal and get your ships up their with zuckuss in ship and dengar with ship to hurt them. Just try to drain them out too. Put some high forfeit imperials up their so you can forfeit them if needed.

VS. Profit. It depends on what you want to do. If you start aliens, then be careful for beatdown, if you dont, use mara and vader to hurt them and drain normally.

VS. Throne room. Make sure you have each site with plenty of power and characters. try to drain them to death. If they take over one of your sites the ISB objective wont let them drain for much their. If you must, just drain at 2 of the sites. VS, throne room you should still beat them with a drain of six.

VS. Jedi test 1 or something with The planet that is farthest from. If they use the planet that etc. then you can drain for 2 at each site, or you can use your high forfeit guys to go down and beat them up with vader and mara so that  you wont have to forfeit too many people. '
