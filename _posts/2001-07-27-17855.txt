Strategy: '

First Turn Pull Docking Bay from Reserve deck. Put Emperor at death star2 docking.
Second Turn Force Generation of 7+ what opponent gives you. You should have a vader.
Deploy another docking Executor or Endor. Deploy Vader. If for some reason you haven`t just deploy someone else to docking bay.
Then after that just start to battle and force draing and dueling.

Against Hidden Base-all space
just drain away with lightsabers and presence and start probing with your ships.

Against a fast setup drain deck like There is good in him deploy dark wasters to stop draining then battle.

Most of the time the dark waters works really well against WYS or fast draining deck.

Don`t Do that again won`t effect to much because you`ve got starships and systems to occupie. If You are finding you can`t get them out play dark waters to stop there drains.
