Strategy: '

The strategy is simple Start The Signal to pull A New Secret Base. First turn search for 2 Hoth sites and deploy them and after that each turn deploy a hoth site or a hoth site and 1 effect with "Echo in title", once thats done start deploying your sytems with your Star Cruisers at Yavin IV, Mon Calamari and Sullust and leave the X- wings at Hoth with Lando in Falcon for support and deploy Spiral where needed. Once you get out Echo Base Garrison start searching for characters and deploy them to the hoth sites to complete your objectives and then pull Echo Base operations and deploy it after that just drain and beat your opponent. Keep Colonel Roosevelt, I mean Jedi Luke at Hoth along with his friends Wedge, Zev and Hobbie and deploy the other characters where needed. The idea for the deck titile came from the movie the " Rough Riders" which I was watching the other night. This deck will be reposted soon once I get some Reflections 2 and update it. I have also considered taking out all the systems except Hoth and putting in Coruscant, Kessel and Kiffex.  '
