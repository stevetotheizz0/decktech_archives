Strategy: '

The first thing I would like to address is the 5 tunnel visions, use these to get whatever you need, with the large activation provided with this deck you should be able to create a large force pile early in the game use this to your advantage. With this deck you have a big choice to make and it will help if you make that choice as early as possable. What is the choice you ask? YOu have to decide if you will play beatdown or drain. Yes, this deck is perfectly capable of both, if you want to play beatdown play the revolution on thier 2/0 sites as soon as they deploy them. If you decide to drain, play one revolution on obis hut and one on massasi ruins; now you will be able to drain for three at each of those sites, not bad There are also to drain three systems, but you should not play these if you are going for the choke, if you deploy them it will give your oppenent 2 force at each. If you are not going for the choke these systems will work out fine as each of them will give you a drain of three. There are many choices that you must make when playing with this deck, as long as you make the right ones you should be able to keep your oppenent at bay.


I play this deck differnently today, take out....
