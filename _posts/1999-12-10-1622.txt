Strategy: 

This deck tries to be a foil to all of the swarm decks out there.	Rather than stocking multiples of the same ships, I've tried going for a variety of different vessels to control systems, so that I will have little to worry from Monnok.  With Haven, most ships will deploy for only 1 force or less, and the pilots will be almost free as well.  I went with a variety of interrupts to make TBH2Pay hurt as little as possible.	The main concern for SAC are the Kessel Runs; Wise Advice should definately be out before you even think about it.  I used several systems to make probing all the more difficult (also why I kept out Coruscant)

Against Ops: The Planet That Its Farthest From as soon as possible.  Between Luke, Obi-wan, and a few of your pilots, you should be able to cause some mischief for them if necessary.

Against HDADTJ: Deploy your spy to the Holotheater; bring a friend if you like.  Be wary if they're dueling, this deck is a little weak in that area.

Against Big Blue: Oh for fun!  You may want to not deploy Ralltiir to keep their forces divided (although your Corvettes will also be trapped on their sides).	Consolidate your forces.
