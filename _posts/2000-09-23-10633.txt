Strategy: '

The goal of this deck is simple.	Sit on Bespin and let them come to you.  And if they do, make them pay.  Use The Signal to get the Effects out quickly, so that you can cancel the drains, add to lightsabers, and retrieve.  The troopers can not only fight (especially with Lobot and Edian), but can cancel drains, and once you have about 6 out, use Nar Shaada Wind Chimes to retrieve even more Force.	You should be draining good too.  Send ObiWan and Luke to the Lower Corrider and Downtown Plaza with the sabers and proficeincy and you should be draining for a lot each turn.  Not to mention that once the Objective is flipped, they cant modify your drains.  This works best against pesky Raltiir Ops and effects like Strategic Reserves, Den of Thieves, and Dreaded Imp Starfleet.
You should also do well in space.  Home One allows for good transportation, the Falcon will give you another destiny, Wedge will cancel theirs, and some of the Reds will add destiny to power.  You should be activating a lot too, since you pull out all of your locations (that also helps, because the destinies in this deck are normally pretty high).  The weapons are great since they normally deploy and fire for less, and the Admirals Order can make using weapons better (as well as make all aliens immune to attrition<6 once the Objective is flipped).
