Strategy: '

Ok, first I'm going to explain why I chose these locations

Death Star-Good Activation
Kashyyyk-Drain 2
Endor Dense Forest-No Speeders
Endor Ewok Village-No Speeders
Endor Back Door-Drain 2
Endor Dark Forest-Drain 2

Ok, well get Vader down as quickly as possible.  Begin draining, battling, and dueling.  Your high destinies should be able to overpower your opponent.  When dueling, make sure you've got a Focused Attack, and sense.  When he plays Courage, or Glancing Blow, sense it.  You shouldn't have trouble winning the duel.

I guess I'll go ahead and go into spec. on certain decks

Speeders
Speeder decks are VERY popular in my area, and whenever I play one, I will not deploy Back Door, or Dark Forest.  It's not worth the 1 force, to get beat down on.  Just drain at the 2 other sites, and at Kashyyyk, and that should be enough.

Numbers
3 Tortures should be enough.

Profit
Start Mara Jade and Dr. E.  Get Mara's saber down first turn, and you should be able to make them lose one of their characters immediately, (Dr. E operates).	Just battle continually, and make sure you have the drain of 2 up in space at Kashyyyk.  Destiny, will be the dirfference in a win, or loss.

Ops
Get ABCTTU out ASAP.  Beat down, with your characters.

Revo
Well I've never seen a Revo deck, where I play, but just in case I've packed one Evader.  That should be plenty, with Crush The Rebellion.


Well, I guess that's it.  Thanks for reading
