Alright, here’s the deal


Traded my Darth Maul With Lightsaber and Lord Vader and Darth Maul to build my Lightsaber Combat Deck for the Light Side. So what Dark Jedi’s you see is what I got.


I plan usually to play Battle Order against Echo Base Operations decks as well as Hidden Base and Lightsaber Combat. Any other deck I use First Strike. I haven’t played this deck against any decks except my friend’s deck who copied my Light Side Lightsaber Combat deck, card for card.


Please give me advise  )


Thank you. '
