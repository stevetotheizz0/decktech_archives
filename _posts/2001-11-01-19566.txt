This deck is based on the simple concept of causing damage, and retrieving most if not all of the damage your opponent deals you. This deck is also based on Jason Kilbys Profit deck, with lots of mains and retrievable high destiny for them to use. Get set up with Qui-Gonn on Naboo with his saber and start draining. Get Baragwins/Yoxgit/Figrin to the Home One DB for retrieval and activation, and get ready for Lightsaber Combay. For Combat you have 4 interrupts to back up your insane 7 destinies, and you have the king of all Jedi, Qui-Gonn Jinn, Jedi Master. By placing/tracking 7s for Combat destiny, you should always be winning the combats and causing lots of direct damage. If your opponent wants to duel as opposed to Comabt, you have Courage and Resilience to help you out with that. If your opponent goes into space, find the Super-Falcon, Defensive Shield for DDTA, use DDTA for Legendary Starfighter, and go beat-down in space. If your opponent is spreading and draining (Dark Deal for example) get out Battle Plan and go battle them with Obi/Luke + Super Falcon while Qui-Gonn drains on Naboo and retrieve, retrieve, retrieve. 

Uhhhh, yeah, thats all. Fairly simple deck, loads of fun to play and strong.
