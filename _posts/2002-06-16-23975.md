Strategy: '

This decks been a pretty good winner for me, and I can usually get a first/second turn flip.  Heres basically how to play it...


Early game - 

using the objective, pull B CC, next turn pull CC Casino, then (depending on whats in hand) either go for a quick flip or pull a couple Clouds.  If youve got a couple characters in hand, along with a starship, go for the flip.  Deploy a character to Guest Quarters and a character to Casino, then deploy a starship to the system for the flip, then move the Guest Quarters character to the Casino.


Mid game - 

Now that the objectives flipped, it gets a lot more fun  Being able to pull a card from your Force pile each turn can be a game winner... but dont rely on just that to get your cards  Heres a list of searching priorities


1) Luke, Obi, Quiggy, and/or Leia to hold the sites

2) the Admirals Order (pull the Cloud Cars)

3) Gas Miners and/or starships

4) retrieval engines (Lando & Sabaac, Off the Edge, Celebration)


Threepio, Mirax, and Thrown Back can help track some destinies for OtE or Sabaac.  The Gas Miners can add to drains and help with activation.  Luke, Leia, Obi and Quiggy (with their sabers) can hold both sites against a small attack here and there, or one site against a dedicated invasion.  The cloud cars can hold the sectors.


Late game - 

By now one or both of the steady retrieval engines should be working.  If both, thats 5 force retrieved every turn  Also, at least one gas miner should be out, giving you drains of 2 at each cloud sector.  With all 4 sabers out, both sites controlled, and all 4 cloud sectors out, that gives you a total drain of 17  Wowza


Card choices - 


Z-95s power 5 at Bespin locations, can add an alien pilot aboard, and EXTREMELY cheap.  nuff said.


Mon Cal cruisers the AO reduces the power of starships at systems unless both fighters AND capital ships.  nuff said.


Sense & Recoil  The Sense is nice to cancel the occasional annoying interrupt, and the Recoil is itself annoying.  Destiny 3 doesnt hurt, either.


OOC & TT TT for Hunt Down/Menace protection, OOC is to get rid of potentially annoying cards.


Matchups - 


Hunt Down does fairly well.  As you can see, Ive got three Jedi in here, so its gonna be a pain for the DS to flip.  Ive also got Corran and the OOC & TT to get rid of Visage.


ISB Ops in the one game Ive played against ISB, the whole thing stalled up for both of us.  Both deck types offer huge drains, plenty of retrieval, etc.  It eventually timed out, and I only won by 1 card.


Hoth Walkers My deck may be fast, but Walkers is just as fast.  A mediocre Walker deck wont do too well, but a tournament-level one will *usually* rip right through this.  I would recommend flipping as fast as possible against one of these, and try to stay at the GQ if possible.


LSC this does fairly good against saber combat.  the new shield keeps their drains down a bit, and the retrieval in this deck can usually make up for it.


Watto havent played it yet, but I think itd be a toss-up between my drains and Wattos damage.


Ive been playing this deck for a while now, and only lost due to lousy draws, lucky opponents, and the occasional stupid mistake.  Overall, though, if you can keep your head, its an extremely solid deck  If theres anything you dont understand about it, please ask me before throwing in a bad rating.  Hope you enjoyed 



*** UPDATE ***

I just got a great idea from a friend of mine instead of using the cloud cars, use the patrol craft from SE with Palace Raiders as drivers.  That’d give each one power 5 and a destiny, and the patrol craft can move as a react, which would help out a LOT with cloud battles.  Now I just need to make room for them....... >) '
