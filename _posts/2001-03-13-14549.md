Strategy: '

Editor’s Note #1 I use 4 copies of Artoo because in one game you will never need more than one of them.  R2 in R5 against TIES, Artoo against MKOS/Court/AOBS that plays S&V/CCT. (A Gift)  They are very good for destiny depending on what you need.


Editor’s Note #2 If you can’t see a way to make it better, say so.  I want to post an updated version so I need good sugestions. (if any)


Okay, start off the prescribed stuff.  Before you activate, go get your 2 generals.  If the opponent deploys an Imp. first turn to the DB, move Luke there and speed them on their way.  To a loss.  If they don’t stuff your activation, then deploy Crix and use him to go get either COK (if they give you three force) or Wuta.  Use Wuta to get the Back door.  Next turn Crix can get Midge and your drains will be moving.  You don’t have a lot of locations, but ITTL, Luke’s Stick and Midge make your drains very high.  Should they play Imp. Decree, don’t let ’em control sites. You don’t need to stop drains because you can ’Edge’ the stuff back. You also have Figrin.  You can win one of two ways. You will win plenty of battles and duels due to your high destinies so you can cross Vader, or you can out-drain them and On the Edge can pull it out.  You can’t pull Endor so their are 2 copies.  You have 14 destinies of 6 or higher after you get out your starting stuff, so you can easily turn Vader.  Now for the reasons for various cards


2 of each EPP You need doubles to overpower them.


Figrin D’an Retrievel and Forfiet fodder.


Artoo works with A Gift, is a spy, 6 destiny.


Starship mix You have plenty to hold Endor.


R2 in R5 Helps against TIES, is a 0 or 7 Destiny. ( I love that choice)


ITTL Stuffs TIEs and helps your drains. Is a 6 destiny.


Strike Planning Pulls your Generals.


Squadron Assignments Pulls your ships/pilots.


Staging Areas Adds to Activation.  Nearly all dark decks play DBs.


DODN/WA Anti-SAC


Menace Fades Slows their drains. (lightsabers, etc.)


Traffic Control Really helps your late-game differential.


Disarmed Anti-dueling and stuffs Fett/Dengar/the like....


Lightsaber Procifiency Helps your Obi survive the ’Circle’.  


A Gift Nullifies MKOS +2 destinies and when added to Menace Fades, can make Court and MKOS drain for Peanuts.


Endor x2 (can’t pull it.)


Insertion Planning Anti Barge, 6 destiny, stops Scum.


WHAAAAAAAAAOOOOW Anti-Court, 7 destiny.


Star Destroyer 7, great for tracking against Imperial decks.


On The Edge x3 Great retrievel


Lost in the Wilderness Make ’em pay for draining at your sites. (highly unlikely they’ll be able to)


Under Attack 6 destiny, anti-Barge.



Now for the matchups


HuntDown/BHBM Hold Endor and sites with an Iron fist.  You should win the Draining match and Figrin+On The Edge will nullify the Visage.  Turn their Vader.


Endor Ops Whup them on the ground and they die.  Turn their Vader or Battle them to death.


SYCFA Hold Endor and Drain the Heck out of ’em on the ground.


Court/MKOS You have all the tools to beat them.  If they give you a DB, Deploy to Endor and move in.  Artoo+A Gift whill wreck them.  Never deploy on Tatooine.


CCT Move Luke+backup to their Db’s and free Han.


ISB Out-drain them.  Slaughter them if they come to Endor.


AOBS move Luke to the DB and they will die.  If they capture him, they are helping you out.


No one Deck-type out their consistantly whup this deck and it can beat any deck type out there.  I am open to suggestions so please offer them.  Thanks for reading this, Enjoy   '
