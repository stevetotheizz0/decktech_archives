Strategy: '

ok, please take the time to read this and to test it (if you can) before scratching this deck up

Start the usual starting set up against all of the decks except against Hunt Down start Goo Nee Tay.

Try to rescue the princess as fast as possible. Then start trying to do some DSP to retreive and eventualy deploy the DS. When you have cards that'll be use for the attack run, deploy them on table (red 6 with proton torpedos etc.) Use your key interrupts wisely. You DON'T NEED TO DRAIN, you can battle, and make them loose force with surprise assault, anger fear during the game.....then when all the requirements are set up, go for blwing the DS....it'll probably be the end of the game by this time.

If you can't retreive as much (secret plan) don't forget that even if you haven't retreived, your DSP is still sompleted and you can deploy DS. If they start DS, it'll be easyer to blow up but they'll only loose 12 forces.

Don't panic if they take leia in captive, use your characters with weapons and don't forget Strangle...you can use the 1st part against a small character and the second, against a bigger one....such as Vader.

Well....i think that's it, and BTW i've won a tourney with this deck.....don't underestimate it

Thanks for your time.
