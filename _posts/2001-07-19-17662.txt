Strategy: '

After my last submission Ive learned so here comes stuff the way you all like it.

Strategy

To start set up tigih, iftc, and hftmf. Your three effects to start are yisyw, strike planning, and insurrection. Before you draw your hand pull madine and solo out. Draw your eight, you now start with ten instead of eight. Smile, you diserve this. You Should have at least one fun card in your hand,I mean satm. Save it for later. Remember to drain with luke as soon as you can.

Now comes the meat. Turn one should depend on what your opponent is running. If he likes the ground drop tons of guys at his one crucial site. In dark deal this deck really makes its presence known. Any way, drop madine with luke if a more aggressive option is not open. This decks key is early and continued pressure on the opponents nerves. Pull another scout and deploy him also, if you need force fast draw panno. Want to set in for  the early drain race draw geezum. Deploy your scout with luke as well. If this isnt the way you want to go drop home one DB and deploy them there instead. Beware, mara sucks to get dropped on you here. Only deploy a DB if it will gate you into there face.

Try to keep luke at the hut. Hes a draining mad man. The dark sides own personal visage that can never be canceled. If they try to capture him drop a ton of scouts on thier head and utilize your satm to clean him out. This should be very easy to do with the lightsabers being the only weapons and many of the scouts adding 1 to each of thier weapon destiny draws. Also force to use it is easy to come by with this decks activation.  If it looks like they will get luke just lie back and wait till you can drop the tea party in the throne room and kill that darn emperor. No emperor, no crossing luke. Heh, heh.

If they start in with that space crap hold a couple of your caps in hand and wait a turn to drop them both together and battle. If you happen to have the force and spiral in hand react it to the battle too. After that your opponents jaw usually drops. 

This is probly the the most important part of this deck, SAC. You MUST control your opponents ability to interrupt. If done correctly, and even against oppressive enforcement you will destroy your opponents chances of winning or affecting a battles out come. 

Podracing is no concern to this deck at all. Just play it could be worse, you already generate more that enough to use it. 

Opponent draining you big time? Then you played something wrong You should be able to utilize both the ebinocs and threepio to get anything that you want whenever you need it.

Remember, be pro-active. Cause your opponent to react to your advances and then SAC his attempts to defend himself

Matchups so far

Court- No contest. Invade drain and kill.

SYCFA/TIES- tough match. Its a drain race. In the end you usually win this one though. Remember you can pull it when you need it and cancel as well as reduce his drains consistantly.

Hunt Down- Honor, beat rush, drain, end of game.

Bring Him Before Me- Kill palpatine and spoil the rest 
of his fun. Your faster than this deck will ever be.

DSII- Dont make me laugh NEXT>

Capture The Queen- another easy matchup. Maul cant battle until you have ability. By the time you drop jedi you should already have about six other scouts there for back up.

Speed Deal (TDIGWATT)- Invade and destroy the opposition Fear nothing, they will never get dark deal in play here

Agents Of Black Sun- Get on coruscant and wreak havok build up on a site and go from site to site cleaning up the planet for decent people. They can never capture enough of your scouts to save thier own tails.

ISB OPS- Not terribly hard to beat either. Build, kill, and drain. Dont forget to mess them up.

Walker Garrison (ISB)-same plan just do it faster. make sure they dont try to pull anything cute. Remember SAC

Ral OPS- This deck bears special mention due to the fact it fun to play against. The extra two you have to pay to play a character here does slow you down a little. But not enough to save them. If this is in your meta game sub out DB 94 in favor of the spaceport DB. Deploy to home one And then DB trans port to raltiir. Makes for a lot of screaming from you opponent when you take his little planet away from him.

Other decks I dont think need mentioning due to the similarities in the way you beat them. Any way, a proto-type of this deck just won me a local tournament, so I have a very fresh look at its capabilities. Thanks for reading.   '
