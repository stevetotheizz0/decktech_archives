Strategy: 

If I read a report about a major tournament at the moment, everybody seems to play Throne room/mains in the US. You should be able to handle that one with this deck.
Start Death Star and take a effect depending on the matchup. Against ops, start Battle Order. If you suspect SAC, start Oppresive enforcement. If you suspect numbers, start resistance. Obviously your choice will be better in the later part of the tournament where you should have heard about what the other players play.
With some destiny tracking, this deck has really lots of removal. I posted a similar deck some months ago, but with all the enhanced cards this one really rocks. Dont rush into battle before you set up a destiny, that way you can allways inflict some damage. Theres no need going for one big beatdown, as you cant prevent the play of Houjix if he left a force. Plus you can retrieve much more, if you battle more often :-)
