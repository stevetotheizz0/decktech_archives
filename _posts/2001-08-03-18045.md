This is only my second post on Decktech, and this deck is kinda goofy, so don’t be like this deck is gay, e-mail me first if you see problems. Thanks


The basic strat against any deck is simple. Deploy your guys to the Echo sites to get EBO up and running, then revo them for extra drain. Put your EPP’s on the ground, either at the Podrace arena after you win it, or somewhere else to drain, battle, and satisfy S&D. Put x-wings up in space, and capitals to support them. The capitals are in there for against Battle Deployment, someone beat me badly in space with it because I had no capitals. Anyway, cancel drains with rebel fleet and retrieve using AWRI. Any game should run smoothly and go your way. I hoped you have enjoyed reading this and maybe using it. Thanks for reviewing it.


Sorry about this one change I have to make but it seems I have forgot a vital card for Boonta Eve Podrace Tatooine Podrace Arena. Ireplace 1 X-wing for Tat Arena.
