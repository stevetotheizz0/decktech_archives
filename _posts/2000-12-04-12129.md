Strategy: '

Addendum Feb 2001


Against space decks, Han+Leia work wonders. Sense any All Power To Weapons. Donâ€™t deploy Kiffex. EBO does give you some advantage, and you can have a pretty safe drain at the North Ridge all game.

Against the new objective, They must start with a character. If he fails to enter his spaceship, a beatdown will end the game real quick. It seems the best way to play this obj. is in space, so just drain him at his own Coruscaunt sites, and use your EBO advantage.

Against Guri, well, you are basically screwed. But you could cut something for a Dismantle On Sight. (Not sure what)


Also, Yoda Stew can be replaced with Yoda Stew & You Do Have Your Moments


Remember, even if your opponent starts anti-SAC, do it anyway. You are a beatdown deck, so function as one, and use SAC to ensure the win.


Your start and strategy will vary every game, but you have the tools to beat just about any Dark Side deck.

The most common vulnerabilities (and solutions) are

They only drain at 2 sites block with undercover spies

They drain in many places Battle Order

They use retrival Aim High/Grabber

They rely on a particular site (docking bay, holotheater, etc.) spy drops down to that site.

They use Ephant Mon to protect the site Choke

They use Barriers to defend Sense

They play generic sites Ounee Tay

They like an effect too much Alter

They are playing a bad deck Mains


Now, to deal with the counter-strategies employed

Bubo R2 and Lando are immune, Momaw can move over during their move phase and snare him on your turn.

Sniper/Force Lightning/Trample Sense it.

Anti-Sense stuff Re-flip Hunt Down, you have too many Senses for enemy SAC to stop you. Anything else? Let me ask you a question. How many anti-spy cards do you have, 2? How many spies + Senses do I have, 11? Whos gonna win?

Barrier/None Shall Pass/YAB/Projective Telepathy Sense. Grab. Thank you.

Gyyyk Frozen/Draw (Sense the Alter)



Now that the tech is out of the way, heres how to play the deck.

Start MPG + NR. Your starting effects depends on the deck. As a default, start ANSB.

As you get out your sites, pull Kiffex last. This is your drain location, just drain there the entire game, and use Undercover Spies/Beatdown/Surgical Strikes to disrupt your opponent.

Sense+Grab+Weapons will ruin most decks.

Note If you do not start Wise Advice, get it out VERY quickly. You need it. Conversely if you dont start ANSB. I really wish I could start both.


Heres the starts against, and weak spots of, the main decks


BHBM

Start Wise Advice, Your Insight, Draw Their Fire.

Use Spies to beat on Empy. Use the -1 defense on Insight to hit Vader.

They will have only a couple sites, Undercover or Beatdown them.


Hunt Down

Start ANSB

Use a spy to cancel Vissage, fortify the site to prevent a reoccurrance.

Dont be afraid of Duels, just Sense them, or draw some tracked stuff (you do have sabers)

Also, they wont drain very widespread, so your Undercover tech should keep you alive.


Dark Deal

Start ANSB

Use Undercover Spies to block his drains, beatdown on weak groups, etc.


Ties

Start Wise Advice, Aim High, Battle Plan

Grab stuff, Spy in ship to Wee, Alter. Drain at the North Ridge.


SYCFA (Prodigy or either parent, or Ties)

Start Wise Advice, Aim High, Your Insight

Grab his retrival interrupts, Alter Scum, play against the Ties.

Sense will be a beating.


SYCFA (Flipping)

Extend your hand and resign. You will loose. Maybe.

If he flips, be ready to beatdown on his now no-longer-dammage-immune scrubs on the Death Star (you have spies for a reason)

Avoid space unless you can Alter the Lat. Dam. (Dont deploy Kiffex)


Ops

Start Wise Advice, Battle Plan, Ounee Tay.

Extend your hand for his concession. Ounee Tay is a huge beating. Battle plan stops crazy draining. (Dont deploy Kiffex)


Endor Biker Ops

Start ANSB

Sense Reacts, Interrupts, grab High Speed Tactics. Tough game. If he doesnt have alot of sites, Undercover folk can do wonders.


Court/MKOS

Start ANSB

Sense, grab, drop Ounee Tay to slow None Shall Pass (plus you have Aliens)

Dont try to go Undercover without multiple Sense backup (Hutt smooch, Sniper, etc.)

Slash Jabba and Alter Scum.


If I missed a deck, let me know.


One final thought. If you drop an Undercover Spy, your opponent might abandon that site as lost, and not reinforce. If so, show him the error of his ways with a resounding SMAK
