Strategy: '

This deck is sorta like Markley's but I tried to
round it out more. Well Guarded will save your
doubles. Dueling is good ;). Destiny is pretty
high. #s shouldn't get through. SAC and annoying
retrieval interrupts will get Hunt Down and Grappled
Keep Vader at the Med Chamber as long as possible
versus Hidden Base. ALSO DO NOT DEPLOY SECURITY
PRECAUTIONS BEFORE A HIDDEN BASE DECK FLIPS 
Counter Assault helps vs. Operatives. 2 I Have You
Nows will also help if you can't duel Luke or Obi.
The Evaders will stop the Revolver that I hear
so much about but never see. And since the destiny
is so high you should be able to choke any character
you want.
