Short Range Fighters & Watch Your Back
Trample
I can’t shake Him 

Strategy: 

before you activate force pull wakeelmui from reserve deck.
if you have Short Range Fighters & Watch Your Back in hand than play it to draw saber 2
from reserve deck.
activate force. search for one docking bay. if there is no saber or saber pilot in deck, then
draw until you get one of them. deploy them to tatooine.
search for all docking bays. deploy one biker scout+speeder bike to a docking bay.
keep some backup in hand (Barrier,Tempest Scout 6)
deploy every scout. at-st, at-at, speeder bike to the docking bay as fast as possible.
If you draw a twi’lek then search for the occupation. He will lose force regulary.
If you’re fast then it’s too much for opponent to react.
In the mid-game deploy sienar. deploy the empi-ships to tatooine.
It’s not so important to retrieve force. the main reason to deploy this ships to
tatooine, is the power bonus. you get a +3 power bonus on every tatooine site for each
empi ship, that means for the two ships and for one saber you got a +7 power bonus.
that’s hard for opponent and good for you. you can deploy ’week’ characters to tatooine
like bane malar. it’s pretty funny to battle the new chewie. use one force to mindscape him,
power +9, some ships on tatooine + 7 power. Bane Malar power 17 + one battle destiny?
that sounds crazy.
Saber 2 pilot searchs the order. order makes drains on db + 1.
if opponent battles you at tatooine system,’lose’ one empi ship to one docking bay, and 
next turn move it to the system again.
This deck doesn’t win very high, may be 5 - 10 but it wins.
ok, that’s it.
thx for reading
