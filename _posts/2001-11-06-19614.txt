Strategy: 

Forgive any tags as this is my third attempt to post

First Turn:

Pull Bespin, Docking Bay, West Gallery, Incinerator, and the Executor. Drop YCHF/SA for Early Warning Network. Deploy locations, Executor to Bespin, Early Warning Network to the Incinerator(only if you have an interceptor in hand), and any effects you drew. Deploy all three Denfensive Shields now. (See list for matchups) Also use We Must Accelerate Our Plans if you drew it to get out the BF: Bridge. Draw up all remaining force. If force drained be sure to lose droids so you can retrieve them on your turn.

Second Turn:

Retrieve any droids. Pull Cloud City. Deploy only enough to hold the Incinerator and Bespin (remember to hold 1 Tie in reserve). Deploy any Effects. Draw up. Eat any drains.

Game:

You should be well on your way to flipping and hopefully Nute should make an appearance on the bridge soon making your destinies really strong.
EV-9D9 will turn the Incinerator into a real pain once you flip, with 2 destroyer droids and EV their you force drain for 5. When attempting the flip lightly deploy to Bespin: Cloud City, flip, then immediatly move all forces to Bespin. You really shouldn’t have trouble in battles at all and you can out drain most decks. Get out DODN/WA fast as SAC is becoming stronger these days.

Every game, play like above. Your Strategy Should Always Be Dominate So Don’t Be Distracted By Theirs. You may want to remove a tie for Sebulba’s Podracer if Podracing is big near you. Your Shields are a real help for this deck.
