Strategy: 

Strategy-	
           *** Bargaining Table is lightside, it should be Den Of Thieves***
            *** Take out a Fozec for a Chyler.***



			Here are the reasons for some cards:

	EV-9D9- lets think about this, power of the 3 and doesn’t cancel
scum. Dah hoyoh!

	Guri- another no brainer, power 4 doesn’t cancel scum. You must
have an IQ of about 2 to not figure that out.

	4-Lom w/g- Cancel Artoo and Threepio’s game text plus he’s just
good all around and doesn’t cancel scum.

	IG-88 w/g- Power 4, can take a person out of the battle by capturing
adds a destiny and doesn’t cancel scum.

	Fozec- just cuz he’s an alien and an ISB agent.

	No IMP Decree because i won’t control 2 rebel base locations
unless they are playing EBO which no one plays in my region, and i don’t
have space in cuz of EBO ,HB and especially WYS!!


	Get your ppl ASAP so you can flip. Especially the Probe Droids and
ORS. Probe your opponent’s hand alot and use Probe Droid Telementary
to place cards out of play. Bye bye Obi. See you later Chewie!

	Also get JP,Audience Chamber, and S&V out ASAP and Sunsdown
ASAP. Have a Tooex at each location you control so your ppl are power
plus 2. ORS are now power=4. Saweeeeet. Your spies deploy for free
when Sunsdown is down and add a destiny to power only. Iggy with 4Lom
and a couple of ORS 3 destiny and with Sneak Attack the total can be as
high as +6! Attrition is scary! Whenever you battle you retrieve 3 force and
they lose 1! boo-hoo-hoo-hahahahahahaha!!

	Now for the matchups-
	EBO- I’ve never played against an EBO cuz no one plays it in my
region. But that is what the Resitance is in for. Put it in for Secret Plans.

	WYS- Secret Plans and SSPFT will save you. When they retireve
with Tat Celeb it costs force. If they use Harvest use 4 force, and that card
is placed out of play. On The Edge, pay and outta play. You get the idea.
Try to keep inide cuz the patrol crafts will kill a they come outta no where
with a guy who adds a destiny! Play smart and you should win.

	Profit Elom- Dahahahahahahahahahahahaha, are you kidding I
could kill thi in my sleep. Start with Chall and an ORS. Then you take an
ORS into hand cuz of Chall’s gametext. Yes it does work then! Their little
Eloms will be so scared they will piss themelves!

	Mains of any kind except WYS- 3 words,..... Search and Destroy.
Just keep retreiving agents.

	If they are using Artoo and Threepio at H1 DB deploy some spy
dude, it don’t matter. Say hello to my little friend ORS!
