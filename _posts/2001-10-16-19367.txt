Strategy: 

I wrote this very early in the morning before I submitted it. I think i misspelled a ton of things.
Here’s my way of attempting to do things with this deck:
Get the Naboo DB out first turn with IAO. Get Gall and executor first turn with YCHF/Mob Points. Save 
1-3 force per turn to search for ISB agents. If the objective is flipped try only to lose ISBs because they can be retrieved. The Menace is there for the massive destiny and to keep maul on the table a while longer. Masterful move can help get Image of the dark lord and Phantom menace for free into my hand. If I interrupt during my control and I have got Drop on the table I can set up two 6s in a row for a track. The space is to help force drains or if they have some space, it is to stop them from draining me out. The space is pretty strong against most space decks, but a whole hearted space deck can flush it out and demolish me in space. The ISBs are there add to force drains so the real idea of this deck is to attempt a beatdown and ground protection on Naboo. The theme hidden behind ISB is Buzzsaw(the 3-2 location, the lightsabers, and the ISB agents adding). All of the lightsabers add one to force drains so there is a pontential loses to force drains. Please review with comments for help, I really want some with this deck, because its really new to me and I havent had that chance to break it in and form it a lot like my other deck, Carbon Frozen Peeps v1.1. Thanks for your help and consideration!

Combos:
6 ISB + Vader + Defending in a battle + Sneak Attack = 
okay power, Battle destiny +7 (Oh My)

Maul Strikes + Darth Maul + Opponent’s Jedi = 
A duel which can easily be won by Maul with his Saber.
