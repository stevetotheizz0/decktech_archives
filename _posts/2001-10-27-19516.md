UPDATE

This IS a Type 2 deck people. SO RATE IT LIKE ONE. Dont say - well this is a good type 2 deck, cause thats exactly what it is. 3 1/2 stars. - I mean how dumb could you be? THINK. Rate a Type 2 deck compared to OTHER Type 2 decks, not stupid normal constructed decks.



The track record of this deck is something like 16-2, with its only 2 losses coming from bad luck(not finding anything in my deck until its too late). 


This deck plays just like any other Hyperdrive deck, only different.


With this deck, try and get Qui-Gon with his saber to the Junkyard ASAP. This is why I included 4 Qui-Gons and 3 Sabers. It usually helps to back him up with one of the other characters in the deck. If you cant find first turn Qui-Gon, then deploy any one of the other characters(except Yarua) by themselves to Watto’s Junkyard since all have high forfiet and power 6(or potential power of 6 with Stay Here) and get a destiny by themselves. After winning the race, get out I Did It and use Too Close to make sure Maul never gets to swing his saber. Use A Tragedy to grab Squabbling versus senate, and usually either Sense, Control, or Maul Strikes against anything else.


Some card choice explanations

Why start the grabber instead of Brisky or The Camp?

Having the grabber to start with makes your opponent think twice before he plays cards like Squabbling Delegates. You can also use this to grab Sense, Control, Maul Strikes, etc. Why not Brisky or The Camp? Well originally Brisky was the start, but I never found a use for it, and when I did, Jar Jar was never in the remaining 10-15 cards in my reserve deck. Plus, Brisky is a popular target for Alter. The Camp is virtually pointless since most players just use senators, Maul, and Destroyer Droids(P-59 and P-60 too).


What’s with the character selection?

4 Qui-Gons and 4 Obis is ESSENTIAL. Obi deploys for only 4 force, can relocate, and is power 6. How can you go wrong with those stats? Qui-Gon is immune to attrition and is the only guy that can yield a lightsaber in Episode 1 format for the light side. As for the other characters, Queen, Palpy, and Valorum all are ability 4 and can be targeted by Stay Here, which boosts their power and gives them immunity. Yarua is included because he is deploy 3, power 5, and another senator for when I flip.


Where is Panaka?

Ive tested him in this deck, and he just doesnt work. He not only takes up 3 slots or more in the deck, but he dies right away due to no immunity. Hardly worth it in my opinion.



Matchups


There really is no particular match ups, this deck pretty much plays the same against them all. Win the race, drop guys, battle, and flip your objective.
