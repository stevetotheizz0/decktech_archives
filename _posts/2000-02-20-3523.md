Strategy: '

This Deck's two main strategies are bounty hunting and force draining.

HUNTNG
 *3 hidden weapons are very useful against mains because you draw a 2 or 3 (which are the two majorities in this deck) and you have yourself a main character captive.	Other methods include Bossk w/ gun, IG-88 w/ gun, and All Wrapped Up
 *Mandalorian Armor, Jodo, and having Fett in your starting hand make it very likely that you will have a character that can use Hidden Weapons out

DRAINING
 *Jade's Saber adds 1
 *Gailid adds one to each JP site
 *There are two locations (the LM Farm and J Wastes) that  have Force Drain +1
 *Jabba activates force for each force drain with an alien

OTHER STUFF
 *Putting Mandalorian Armor on Kitik Keed'Kak is very nice - power 10, armor 5, immune to attrition <3.  I also like putting it on Gailid b/c he has this nasty habit of attracting lots of attention from the opponent
 *Boba's Rifle, Dr. Evazan, and Amanaman OR Dannik Jerikko gets you nice additions to attrition OR power, and very quickly at that
 *Disarmed is for those nasty EPPs or just any main with weapon that you don't like
 *Myo, well, let's just say he can be very irritating to your opponent)
 *Chall Bekan, Lyn Me, and Scum And Villany help to deploy characters faster
 *Bossk in H Tooth, 4-LOM, IG-88, and Res Luk Ra'auf can all add battle destinies
 *Jabba, Mara, Djas, Zuckuss, IG-88, Bossk in H Tooth, and Boba in Slave I can all draw battle destinies while alone


The only real problem I have run into with this deck is the effect A Gift, b/c it really screws up my battle destinies and force drains, but I usually still manage to win via heavy beatdowns and force drain modifiers.  '
