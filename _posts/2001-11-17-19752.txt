Strategy: 

Please read the strat before reviewing.
This is my first submission.

Before you activate: Take Carida into hand with 
Mob Points, take emp’s power w/Throne room, and take lose YCHF for Imperial Arrest Order.

Get the Emperor to his Throne ASAP.
Beatdown whatever your opponent lets you.
Play reactively until late game.
During late game, opponent should not have many characters left, so drain with whatever you have.

Matchups
WYS: Do not let them have Kessel.  Set up in the cantina.  Get battle deployment down to prevent beatdowns.  Take over space with your impressive fleet.  Track a phantom menace and trample Jedi Luke.  Make sure to deploy dreadnaughts in pairs.  Not a very tough game because most smugglers are easily trampled, and emperor’s power kills in space.

HBX: Auto win.  Ask the Wash. State Champ.

RST:  Don’t let them have the bunker (duh).  Take thier system.  Set up fighter cover.  Your characters w/immunity are now more immune and hit stuff easier.  Like WYS, trampling is easy most of the time.

Profit:  Probably your toughest match-up.  Deploy Doc E and Mara to the chamber.  They usually don’t have space, so take advantage of it.  Trample whatever he puts outside.  Duel Luke, and Obi, but I strongly recommend that you track, especially versus this deck.  This match-up is about out-playing.

Card-choices
No objective: BHBM makes this deck suck.  They either throw Luke at you over and over or you are losing a force on your turn.

first strike: This deck initiates a lot of battles.

Nute Gunray: ability 4, forfeit 6, destiny 3 all for three force.  With Emperor’s power he is an excellent kamikaze.
