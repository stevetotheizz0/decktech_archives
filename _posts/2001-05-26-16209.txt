Strategy: 

This is my first deck on decktech, so please take that into consideration when you are rating it. This deck uses Kessel runs to retrive force, and at the same time dominates the space, and if your lucky, the ground too. I read your reviews and I have decided to start with Heading instead of Signal. Start squad Assaignments and aim high, sometimes. Pull people with ships and vise versa, complete 2 kessel runs, flip the ojb, get multiple destinies and kick some imperial toush.

Explanations of cards:
Kessel Run- I dont see why other people dont use this with watch your step, it flips, and kicks.

Red 5- Kicks with Luke

Leebo- Kicks with Kessel Run

Aim High- Kickish effect

CEC- Kickish effect, good with YT-1300 and Quads

YT-1300- Kicks with CEC and Kessel Runs

Heroes Of Yavin- Kicks with Luke, Han and Chewie

Don’t Get @#$%y- Kicks with Luke and Han


I’ve played this deck in very few Tournaments so I don’t know any matchups. Just get the Kessel Runs working and kick in space!
