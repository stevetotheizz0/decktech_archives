Strategy: '

Okay, I Dont want to hear anything about Ounee Ta In fact thats good, i hope they have it and use it. As soon as they hit the table, i will beat the crap out of them

Okay, first turn, pull YAVIN IV DOCKING BAY(IAO), <> JUNGLE (Objective), ans Wakeemui (Mob. Pts.).as soon as you get a teilek, grab Seinar Fleet Systems ans drop it at wakeemui.  First, get set up at the system, with the TIES (but dont deploy them until you have SFS out, so you can retreive force). When you are set up here, begin to concentrate on one or two sites, preferably the forest and docking bay.  Get out people on YAVIN IV and get our REBEL BASE OCCUPATION.  Try to Find Organas Ceremonial Neclace. With all this, you will be hitting them up for a bunch.  Get Expand the Empire on the forest, so you have Immunity to Attrition.  Pile up all of your ships on the system and your power on the ground is ENORMOUS You will probably be able to hold the system easily, you have enough space. Noone would go against 10 interceptors, 2 dreadnaughts, The Emperors sword and Shiels (By the way, if you have Emperor Palpatine out, they are power 6). In space the ships, combined with Dark Manuevers and All Power to Weapons, will be powerful as hell. Also if you have that many ships on the system your power on the ground is huge. Think about it, you have, lets say 5 interceptors, The Emperors Sword, A Dreadnaught are on the system. Vader is In the Yavin IV Jungle by himself, he is a power 17, immune to attrition, with a lightsaber (just Crazy Man).  If you play this deck smart, you will beat the crap out of the opponent, with your massive power, drains and retreival.  There is no need to put deck matchups, because every game is the same, follow this strategy, and play smart and the game is yours.  

JUST A FEW CARD EXPLANATIONS
Sergeant Irol, Sergeant Barich, and Corporal Drelosyn When Drelosyn is with Irol, he adds a batle destiny, and barich can subtrace one destiny from opponents attrition and power. Theyre just cool, plus they are IAO fodder

Short Range Fighters Get an interceptor, plus a well time one can retreive a bunch of force, and save a game.  

Mighty Jabba Hes just cool, plus put him with Xizor, and now you have 2 battle destinies, and if they dont have an ability greater than six, theyre screwed

Much Anger in Him Just sweet if Poeple come to Yavin IV, they might not want to battle, well thats fine too, just lose 4 force, he he he

Please look at this deck and review honestly.

Thank you and MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU...
