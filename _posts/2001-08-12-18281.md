***update***>


I just noticed, that you have to have 5 BATTLEGOUND systems to flip, not 5 systems... so take out Datooine and  ’They’re on Datooine’ and add in another system... I Dunno, any battleground system, not like it matters =P... I’ll also add in Thrown Back instead of ’They’re on Datooine’ beacsue people told me to take it out.


<***update***


First off, a ton of people will probibly be like what the hell is he thinking? hes trying to distroy the bunker... in a hidden base deck  but in reality you can distroy the bunker, or do anything in any deck.


I chose Hidden Base Because of its early game potential.


Heres how play goes


You will notice I listed 10 locations but said only 9 were in my draw deck, this is becuase I have to chose either Endor or Sullust as my X Marker which is my hidden base.


Now this is how play goes.


During my opponents turn, before my turn. Draw General Crix Madine and General Calrissian into hand (if one is already in hand, pull General Solo instead of one)


1st Turn

Activate

Deploy Endor from RD or Hand. (deploy a system from RD if Endor was in hand)

Deploy General Calrissian and Gold Squadron 1 to endor. (squadron assignments if needed)

[deploys for 3]

Draw Remaining Cards.


2nd Turn.

Activate

Force Drain at Endor if they didnt contest.

Deploy System.

Use Mindful of The Future to pull either Endor Back Door or Endor Rebel Landing Site.

[use for 2]

Use either The Signal or Throw Me Another Charge. (signal prefured) To pull either The Shield Is 

Down or Explosive Charge

[use for 3 or free depending]

This sets up my two destiny right after each other 5, 5 or 5, 6

Which I then track through my deck.

Deploy Locations and/or Characters

[as force allows]

Draw Remaining Cards.


(yes I realize I might not get mindful or signal, but when I Get them I use them in tandem in order to set up a nice 2 destinys cycleing)


Thats a basic Start, but it all depends on what cards I get in my hand, and what I draw.

I deploy whatever Systems I have... whenever I have, same with all sites but bunker. 


I draw till I get Deactivate The Shield Generator into my hand.

Signal for The Shield Is Down

Throw for Explosive Charge

Minful and Endor Site onto table.


Done. its set.


I deploy Crix with whomever else I want... whenever I think I can keep him alive.

Try to keep my characters Alive.

Most People Will think Im doing this to satisfy a Battle Order of theirs or my Menace Fades

Crix Pulls CoK to my hand. If I have him out early, also pull Colonel Cracken or Blout to hand.


I only Deploy CoK When Ive got The Shield is Down and Explosive Charge and Deactivate The Shield Generator in my hand. (usually around turn 4)

CoK Pulls Wuta (free)

Wuta Draws Bunker (2 force)

Deploy Bunker

Deploy Deactivate The Shield Generator

Deploy Colonel Cracken Or Lt. Blout to the Bunker. (3 or 2 force respectively)

Deploy Explosive Charge

Move all Characters from the Back Door To the Bunker.


Next turn...


since Ive tracked the 5,5 or 5,6... 

The Bunker Is Distroyed...

He Loses 8, I retrieve 8, his hand goes to his used pile.


Now I should have 5 Systems out by now.

so I Decide to FLIP.

he has no hand, and he must pay 1 to draw 1.



Since not many people play space, or play limited space, I dont need to have to many ships in this deck.


Since I only flip after Ive gotten rid of their hand, I dont have to worry about them probing my system for a few turns.


I retrieve force from whatever early game play they have when I distroy the bunker. (save some force if needed for secret plans or I just forgo the retrieval)


for podracing Ive got It could be worse and Sense if they like to play Its worse


OH, I almost forgot... Commence Recharging and Theyre on Datooine are nice cards to slow/stop the Set Your Course For Alderaan Flip. (if they dont flip, there is no worry)


*** Im thinking about doubleing up on bunker, but am unsure, and havent had trouble with getting the bunker out during play. but Im thinking it might be a little trouble ***


So thats the basics, if you have any constructive comments let me know what you think I should do to help the deck out.
