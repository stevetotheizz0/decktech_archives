Strategy: 

Yet another of my BH decks, but I decided to try the Rancor instead of Sarlacc due to higher retrieval
Forgive the title, but I had to think up somthing eye grabbing and creative:)
Basic Rundown:
If they come to you, capture, deliver, feed, retrieve.
If they don't come to you, drain away!
Even with all of the drain bonuses canceled, I can still drain for 7.  With the modifiers I have a drain high of 12.
Scum and Villany, Chall Bekan, and Jabba's SB speed up deployment
Skiffs, Zuckuss, and the Niktos(if Bib is out) can all react

Now to be a little more specific:)

Against MWYHL
We're the bait is fun if they come in with Leia or some main like that
2 sabers makes it easy to slash
hidden weapons to capture luke:)
Use Bossk in Tooth or some other ship to go to Dagobah
Front side of the obj - makes them lose a force each turn.

 Against Throne Mains/Force Choke
Oota Goota to stop Nabraun
Bubo to stop Nudjis
Sabers to slash
Bad Feeling Have I and No Bargain add to deploy cost
Against Throne Room I start Bad Feeling Have I b/c Scum and Villany could get canceled

 Against Profit
Start with Mara and Chall.  This gives a good power boost and cheaper deployment.
Gaurd the AC with everything you have.	Drain with weaker characters at sites w/ no lightside icons like Dungeon and Rancor pit(as long as the Rancor isn't there:)

Against Undercover Madness
Nevar Yalnal
Hutt Smooch
Sniper

Against Inserts
Resistance to reduce force loss, otherwise there really aren't any problems.  This is where I get the big drains going.

Against Hidden Base
Drain big and drain fast
Probe a little with the ships

Suprise Assault can SERIOUSLY hurt this deck if used right.

Other Factors:
Gailid drains well
Niktos are a defense mechanism against beatdowns.  in a defensive battle @ JP sites, they are power4, forfeit 5, and if Bib is at a JP site, the Niktos deploy as a react.
Bubo is always fun
None Shall Pass is to stop main deployment.  There is only one b/c I can't use it if Mara or DV w/ saber is at a JP site
Ghhhk is anti beatdown
Binders has been known to help a lot, I have found it useful to have a pair on standby.
Reactor Terminal is so I can draw a lot and not worry so much about a small reserve deck(unless they alter it:)

WHAT???!!! Darth Vader????!!! Doen't he cancel Scum and Villany???!!!
First of all, no he does not cancel it.  He SUSPENDS it.
He is in there for suicide runs against annoying mains and the like.

I guess that's about it for now.  Give me some honest reviews, I want to see if Sarlacc or Rancor is better suited for this deck.
