If you don’t know what this deck does, please don’t rate.  I am looking for improvement suggestions, and decktech always comes through.

A few things you might not be aware of

Use tunnel vision to pull Tosche Station.  Get Jedi Luke with stick, utility belt, and lightsaber proficiency, and you will generate 14 force at that site alone.  Not to mention jedi luke will be power 13.

Who’s scruffy looking, used destiny 6 interrupt, cancels wookie kiss.

Perimeter Scan, used destiny 4, for one force look at opponents hand.

The rest is elementary.  I want improvent ideas

THANKS '
