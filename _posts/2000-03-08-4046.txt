			    *****REVISION*****

This deck has lots of activation so change "Yoda, You seek Yoda" to a "Tunnel Vision" which is much more useful ;)

		      *****STRATEGY*****

Ok I figrued this deck is worth a try.	I've tried to combine OMDH, HB, Test 2, and Beat Down tech in one deck.  The idea is to get the low destinies out of your deck quickly with HB, the Dag sytem, and the Training Area.	Then train any mofo you want with Test 1, park Yoda at the Hut and drain with the apprentice at the TA.  The nice thing about this deck too is that it can complete both tests even with Broken Concentration on the table as long as you get out Luke's Backpack and set up a 6.  Then just blow people out of the sky and flip HB during the end game.  Retrieve like mad easily.  Thanks to the high activation, Secret Plans shouldn't be a problem.

vs. HDADTJ- Just choose your fights wisely.  Don't take Obi to the ground and only take Luke when you have the Run Luke, Runs.  TT and Jeroen to take care of Visage.

vs. ROPS/Ops/ISB- Test 1 and 2, Battle Plan, Order to Engage, and heavy OMDH retrieval should take care of this nicely.

vs. #s- Don't Forget the Droids when possible and retrieve the other damage with OMDH.  Fight and Order to Engage helps if they're weak in battles too.  Test 2 helps here as well.

vs. Big Blue- This oughta sting a bit.	Just pick your fights wisely.  Test 2 will help you fight the walker or SD and pilot combo's.	Use the landing claw to your advatage.	With Jeroen Webb/Leia and Yoda at the Hutt, the Falcon is immune to attrition < 8.  If Homing Beacon is big in your area then add Han's Tookit into the deck.	If Walkers are big then get another Obi w/ Saber in the deck and add Under Attack for big beats.

If there is one I missed then I'll add it in after you review it.  Thanks in advance for being fair before you rate this just don't go too easy on me   ;)	  '
