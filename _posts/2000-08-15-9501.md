___________________________________________________________
What people dont get is that i DONT GIVE A FUCK about advise. i  just post
my deck to know whos stupid and whos not and when you say take this out
or put this in, most of the time i will think your a SCRUB because your advise
SUCK and if you play with it and you get rape dont blame me if you
 SUCK ASS you MOTHER FUCKING SCRUB

MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE THIS DECK IS NOT FOR SCUB
___________________________________________________________
just train a random 4 ability moron.
set what ever you need by looking into your deck.
insert when its necessary and beet the crap out
of him when your ready....
if you need more strategy dont play with this deck you will get raped with it
and if you want to give it half a star, feel free to do it
