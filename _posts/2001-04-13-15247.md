Strategy: '

I get my matching pilot with their matching starship and flip the objective. I get two Kessel Runs done fast from Tatooine to Kessel.I keep the oblective flipped. I cycle through my deck with How did we get into this mess? I back myself up with plenty of useful high destiny interupts.Im prepared for a Vader to appearand wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t. I get to use The Force Is Strong With This One four times because of the 7 side of the objective. It has good potential and is strong in a lot of places and vulnerable in few. '
