Strategy: '

Ok, this is my shot at a rescue the princess deck based on a couple versions that ive seen in here and the version my brother plays that is slightly more retreival based (uses baragwins and On the Edge with tracked destinies), except that this one is a little bit better shored up than the other ones against the more popular kinds of decks.. first of all, this deck succeeds based on  when its flipped, the opponents characters are removed from the game, never to come back.. so against the drazin engine, bye drazin, against Vader+Tarkin, one EPP saber, and you never have to worry about vader again, add in the +2 to attrition EVERYWHERE, and the high overall destiny of the deck, especially in the late game, and youve got things dying all over the place.. when you fight in space, track a couple 6s, and they lose 14 from the site every turn, when youre on the ground, saber and shoot everything while keeping the bacta tank up and running... included is protection from duels in the form of high destiny (track 2 6s and watch vader go bye bye) and the standard anti cards (glancing blow and courage) thatll ensure that you win and they lose in the duel.. the drain potential is a little shaky, but the retreival with death star plans (immune to alter with a bothan spy who cant be choked in a lift tube) makes that slightly moot.. possible additions for the local meta would be surprise assault and a few controls... other than that, it plays like a mains deck that uses spys to get leia, uses leia to get reflection, and bothan spys to retreive en masse.. and when i think about it, id probably remove jeroem webb for Ooola if i took this to a tournament.. other than that, its got protection against manipulation, numbers, dueling, and DS space.. its got heavy retreival, EPPs mass characters, spys against visage, and all kinds of fun stuff..
