Strategy: '

Ok, here we go. Start with H DP and get H IP w/ Combat Rediness. Wait til Lightside deploys then go clear the site, there are not many characters but they're enough. This deck is quite red, but the interrupts are all useful and very powerful.

How to play --

-- vs. M / T  Play it cool and wait til opponent deploys somewhere then go kill him. Use CHYBC and Battle Order to stop the drains. Here your red cards play a big role. Also you got a S A C protection. This shouldn&#8217;t be an too difficult victory.

-- vs. Rescue TP  Like Mains and Toys but be sure you don't lose your characters too easy and go smack the 8D8 with your Sniper and beat the crap out of Leia.

-- vs. Profit. Throne Room etc.  Same Mains and Toys.

-- vs. Hidden Base  Drop down Battle Order, if he tries to get to the ground you kill him. Decree stops the bonuses in space and use BH ships to Probe under Security Precautions. Drop down your mains on the battle ground and start draining your opponent to death. Easy, huh?

-- vs. Operatives  Drop down Battle Order and get Decree running, beat the Ops and flip back the objective. That's when the party starts.

-- vs. Other odd decks  The red cards should take care of this, drop down Battle Order etc., play torture and drain. Be sure to think what you're doing carefully.

If you just have time test this deck and get surprised.

Don't give me stupid review just because I like the old fashion w/ not so many characters, I promise this deck really works.
