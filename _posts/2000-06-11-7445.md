Strategy: '

Ok, well, you can pull everything you're going to need (pretty much) from your reserve deck.  Assuming you have 3 characters, EBO can be set up on turn two.  Then pull systems and get your power 4, ability 2 (once you get incom corporation out) x-wings to the systems to drain.  If you have Rieekan out, they can't get rid of EBO.  Once you have EBO going, move all your characters to whatever site Incom Corp is at (you need to protect it).  If they come down to battle on ground, You've got high forfeit (and they will probably leave you alone).  In space, using laser cannons, and power pivots/direct assaults.  Stop their drains with Rebel Fleet, and once you've got 10-15 x-wings on table, play all wings report in.  You'll be able to retreive probably everything you've lost....'
