Strategy: '

alright here it goes


start game.use mob points to pull wakeelmui.sac the you cannot hide forever to pull inc losses.depending on how much force your opp will get 1st turn drop a tie to kashhhk.because you get plus 1 activation at systems you control.pull evader monnok and check your deck for systems,or usefull cards you may need so you can determine if you wana draw or drop a tie.if you draw neimodian adviser use it to pull another system out.


setting up.just keep getting systems,and ties at the systems.you will get plus 1 activation at each system.use your 1st twi lek 2 get sfs,or the fleet,whichever you need at the time,but make sure to get both asap.


the deck has 4 tie guns,and 2 fighter cover.interceptors get 2 shoot twice,and with the good destiny in this deck it shouldnt be 2 hard to shoot every fighter your oppenent puts out.if they do get like capt han and corran horn on falcon,just use lat damage and overwhelemed to place it in their used pile.it will take them awhile to get these out again(if ever)if they are using capital star ships,use lat damage and overwhelmed on them.make sure to use monnok to keep them from drawing up a ton to try and get a huge fleet.


you may ask how do you keep from getting beat down with only 1 tie per system.i usually set up a tie and gun at each system i wana drain at.if they come down with a starfighter,i shoot it,or i can barrier it.if both fail,i just ghhhk and my tie and gun go to used pile.if they drop a capital and barrier doesnt work jsut ghhhk,and use the lat damage overwhelmed combo.this deck eliminates space fleets very easily.it also has plenty of beatdown potential,with 2 dreadnaught,and all power to weapons.if your oppenent happens to get major hashy’n use the set for stun to take him out and then lat damage,and oeverwhelmed.if not drop some ties and a dreadnaught,battle,all power to weapons and wreck them.


if you didnt understand how easy it is to eliminate the oppenents space fleet,feel free to d mail me with any questions,but the above stratedy should explain it all.


now on 2 match ups


wysa good watch your step will have atleast one a few manuevers,and 1 x wing gun.you have so many more guns and ships that they wont be able to keep these cards around for very long.it should be pretty easy to elminate their space fleet.to start get 1 tie at each system,and wait for them 2 deploy.after they deploy,react on your turn with your cannons and more ties and kill there ships.


lscthis match up will be a race.lsc has very little space,and deffinately not anything you should fear.you should set up as normal,tie to each system.save your defense and guns in hand.you should be able 2 win the drain race because you can inflict more damage.if they have i hope shes all right it will get very close.you will be able to retrieve alot of force,and try and limit their force retrievel.


profitprofit is a tough match,but luckily not alot of people play profit these days or have alot of space in them.you must get out very fast to beat profit.use your drain blocking ability,and sfs to retrieve as much as you can.spread your ties out and hold barriers in hand.if they come to space,just shoot them down.getting out fast means everything in this match,and you may have to throw caution to the wind


hidden baseif they are using x wings they auto lose.they must spend +2 to deploy to every system you have presense at,and tie guns absolutely own x wings(interceptors can shoot twice)if they are using matching pilots,same thing,,,shoot down their ships,but play smart.dont spread out to thin.use your dreadnaughts and lat damages to pick your fights.


ebomost ebo use x wings.interceptors own x wings(see hidden base match up) shooting twice a battle will kill their wings so fast they wont know what hit them.all your dead ships and guns go to your used pile,and you have very good retrievel.any x wing deck is an easy match up for this


tigihthey cant contest much in space unless they have home one.spread out and drain for as much as possible,while retrieving,and canceling their drains.if they have home one,,,lat damage and overwhelmed will end its day.


qmcthey will probaly flip on you,but if you kill off their ships just as fast as they put them out,they will never be able to contest you in space.did i mention tie guns wreck.pucimer will hirt a bit,but if you own the system you can use dreaded fleet,and tarkins orders to limit their drains,while draining for a ton in space.they only have about 5 ships usually,and their ships should never last more than a turn.tie guns will hirt them bad.if they get the capt and corran on falcon,just use lat damage and overwhelmed.


senateif they are using hit and run senate,they should die easily because you give them no one for their epps to battle,and you can shoot any star fighter they put out.the thing that will hurt the most is them taking 2 cards everyturn.you will own space.use the lat damage and overwhelmed of they get home one out,and if they have fighters just own them with tie guns.


this deck gets its systems out preety easily,you can use crush to track systems,and the 2 neimodians 2 get systems even faster.also the starting effect from theed allows you to activate plus 1 at systems you comtrol,so force wont be an issue.use the tie guns and lat damage/overwhelmed combo to eliminate all of their fleet,and drain for a ton.i hope she is alright will hurt this deck,but it isnt the end of it.this deck can drain race with the best of them.also not alot of decks use i hope shes all right anymore.good idea to get oppresice enforcement out early jsut in case of sac.this deck is a beast in space,and rarely needs to actually rely on a beat down in space.it retrieves like a machine,and cancels force drains while draining for a ton in space.


thx all for reading,and sorry in advance for spelling and grammer.hope you enjoy
