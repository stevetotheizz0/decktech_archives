Strategy: '

This deck is not designed to face off against another Senate deck. I designed it in hopes of catching everyone at my local tournament (in Nurenburg, Germany) by surprise. Why? Because, let’s face it, if your opponent has no senators you can get any bonus you want from your senators, and what I wanted was retrieval. I got mad retrieval in all the play test games I played with it and the tournament except in the only two games that I played vs. another Senate deck, which were this decks only to losses. 


That was the results of the original deck. This is the updated deck with the new cards. Still not designed to face off with another Senate deck.


Stars of the show Mas Amedda, Sei Taria, and Yarua. For this deck to work Yarua and Mas Amedda must be in the majority, throw in Sei Taria and unless your opponent has ”Imperial Decree in play, you get massive force drains also. 


Always get the Coruscant Guard to the Senate; this prevents your opponent (with no senators) from deploying someone to get a destiny draw just to get rid of your senators. 


Pull the docking bay and deploy it first turn. All other characters (besides the senators of course) deploy here so you can meet the system + site requirement. With Caldera Righim at the docking bay the opponent won’t be able to deploy enough characters there to start a battle to take the bay away from you. 


Always use Liana Merian’s game text. 


Save Senator Palpatine’s text for space battle’s you can’t Hyper Escape from. 


Supreme Chancellar Valorum’s text is a nasty surprise for anyone who tries to take your docking bay. Especially if Caldera Righim is there. 


Use The Signal to pull effects in the following order. 1) Rebel Fleet, 2) Bacta Tank, 3) Legendary Starfighter, 4) Senate Hovercam. 


Always deploy X-Wings from Rebel Fleet unless you can get one on table and Hyper Escape early. 


The Bacta Tank will help you hold the docking bay. Just redeploy your lost character (oh, say someone with a lightsaber) back to the docking bay.


Use Might Of The Republic to get the stars of the show first, then a Guard, then to retrieve. 


If anyone has suggestions on how to improve this deck, please let me know.
