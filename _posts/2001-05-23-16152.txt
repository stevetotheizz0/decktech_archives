Ok, thanks for Reviewing my deck This is the deck I took to the Ontario Provincials (May 12th), and last weeks tournament in Hamilton (May 20th). It went undefeated through both. And I ended up winning the tournament in Hamilton.

**UPDATE May 24, 2001**
Sorry i forgot to include Rendili in my Cardlist
**END UPDATE**

Now, for my 3rd starting effect, you have to choose from First Strike, Battle Order, There Is No Try & Oppressive Enforcement, Imperial Decree and You Cannot Hide Forever. I realize I have tons of effects, but many are game winners. Obviously, if you are playing against EBO, youll want to start with Imperial Decree. Against Odds, you start You Cannot Hide Forever. Against hiding and space you  start You Cannot Hide Forever, and then sack it for Search & Destroy. Against Hidden Base, you start You Cannot Hide Forever, than sack it for Security Precaustions. Against big force draining you start Battle Order. I usually pull First Strike out on its own than deploy it before the first time I lay a beating. There Is Try & Oppressive Enforcement you would deploy if sense and alter are being played by your opponent. If in doubt of what to start with, then start You Cannot Hide Forever, since it is the most versatile. 

Now to playing the deck Before you activate, if your opponent started with a system then pull Flagship Executer with Mobilization Points; otherwise, pull Rendili. Activate, pull death star II docking bay and deploy Palpatine there from your reserve deck. Search for Force Lightning. Draw any remaining force, unless you got Janus or Sim Aloo in your Starting Hand. In that case, deploy them down with Palpatine. Next turn, activate, you will activate 7 + whatever the opponent gives you on turn 2. Pull Endor Docking Bay and deploy it. Use Janus and Sim, pick up. If the opponent has most of his characters down in any point during the game deploy Presence of the force down on death star II docking bay. Pull cloud city docking bay, leave force in your force pile. Next Turn, activate 8 + whatever opponent gives you (probably activate about 11 or 12, to give you 20 force in your force pile. Use Sim Aloo to look at the opponents reserve deck. If its >3 than put it to the bottom. Deploy vader, his saber and whatever else you can deploy down with the remaining 14 force. (remembering to save 1 to initiate the battle) If lukes already on table than try to avoid deploying to his site. Initiate battle, win opponent looses 1 to insignifigant rebellion and chances are you cleared the site. Next turn force drain for 3 or 4 at vaders site (1 or 2 from the site, presence of the force, his saber). If you presenced of the force the death star II docking bay than drain for 2 there (janus adds one). If lukes not on table than dont forget to make them loose 3 from your destiny. If all is good they loose 9. if not they loose 3 or 4 minimum. Now, start janusing for another beatdown squad, mara jade, ig-88 with riot gun, and jabba and fett are all good combos. Jabba, fett and ig-88 draw 3 battle destiny + 11 power , 1 weapon and 1 capturer (impressive). You win the battle. The loose 1 to insignifigant rebellion (there is now 2 on insignifigant rebellion). Docking bay transit your beatdown forces around, beating on the opponent. If your opponent is dumb enough to give you luke after you have 3 on insignifigant rebellion than youve won the game. Just sim aloo the top of their reserve deck and make sure u loose the duel, draw a 4 and the games over. Otherwise, the opponent looses because of your massive drains and beatdowns. 


Card Descriptions

Imbalance - if the opponent retrieves force play this used interrupt to make them loose ½ of what they retrieved.

Omni Box & Its Worse - kills on the edge, tracking asp droid with portable scanners, etc. As well as murdering the opponent if they play it could be worse.

Search and Destroy - we all know the power of this card. They decide to keep off battlegrounds to avoid your beatdownsthan they pay the price

The Circle Is Now Complete - other than the fact that its a 6 destiny. Ok, the opponent  has epp obi, luke and kal fal ncndros down. You deploy vader and his saber. Luke is captured you play the circle is now complete and obi is placed out of play now little kal fal is gonna get the beating of his life

Limited Resources - amazing card Its a close game the opponent throws everything down with traffic control or they decide to loose any force they want to from theyre hand. Play this they loose 4 force.

Imperial Barrier - I cannot tell you how many games these have saved me. (everyone knows what is does, if not youre a scrub)

Why Flagship executer and not the regular? Its all  about the destiny and cheaper deploy. The immunity is great, but whens the last time you saw a lone executer, come on it cant even draw destiny.


Matchups

Against Ground You play like it says in the strategy

Against Space spread out and drain, get search & destroy out. If its hidden base make them loose 10 from security precaustions. If they give you luke, take him to the throne room and track sixes to ensure they loose 3 force every turn.

What can I say the strategy section says it all. You dont know the power of this deck until you see it in action. Any weaknesses have been patched up with effects, ie. EBO drains stung so I through in Imperial Decree.

Thanks for reviewing my deck Constructive reviews appreciated.

May The Force Be With You
