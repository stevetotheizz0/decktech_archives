Strategy: '

Well I made about 9 card changes from Martin Akesson’s pre coruscant version.


Now some of the cards as to why they are in the deck is explained in his and well i can’t say it much better than he can so if you need to check it out here I”ll explain some others

http//www.decktech.net/swccg/decks/light/lightdetail.php3?deck=18079


Why Lando with Gun? To be perfectly honest It was a Lando w/ Axe until the night before the DPC but Mike one of the guys i went with wanted to make a profit deck and the other one was his so.


Master Qui Gon

Well I see him more as an offensive Qui Gon figured I’d run into an AOTBS varient or some senate w/ Coruscant sites so he went in.


Battle Plan/DTF instead of just DTF like in Mart’s deck

Well in playtesting losing to DTF and FS became a problem for my differential and I only really wanted it for the use 1 force for the interrupt thing and BP is nice to have to slow your opponent down some.


I Hope She’s Alright

I was expecting space big time and I met up with it. The damage from this helped out alot


We’re Doomed

The card is amazing don’t even argue this one


Jedi Escape

I was scared of Hunt Down big time with this deck I figured this would be useful had Obi or Qui Gon got Dueled but it never happened (cept i got circled once against Ral Ops and didn’t have the card in my hand) 


Matchups


This all depends really on your playing style for most decks. I made the mistake of playing really defensively and waiting to flip until i’ve lost the force but flipping it gives them damage and the more damage you give the shorter the game and that 5 force is the 2 turns you didn’t wait and would of been damaged had you done nothing. So go for the quick flip.


 If they are playing Senate put Boushh there cause senate drains really hurt in the long run especially if there’s a POTF there. All of you screaming Honour.. read Tikkes


Hunt Down

Read my TR and do the opposite of what i did against Chris Twigg


Well that’s it I suppose if you give it a try good luck. Just remember 1 thing Threepio is a machine.


Oh yeah missed a thing in my TR

Props to Andrew Liu for helping run the thing


If you haven’t yet.. check out my TR
