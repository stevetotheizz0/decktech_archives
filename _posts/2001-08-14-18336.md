Strategy: '

Ive noticed the weaknesses of this deck before and tried to fix em. its just mains and toys that tries to get a 1st turn flip and jump start. i would not stall them to get a 1st turn flip, its THAT crucial. the rough match ups were hidden base, throneroom mains and hyperdrive generator... but it can still hold its own.


against throne room mains, i just concentrate my forces and at mos espa and the junkyard. keep i have you now and weapon lev in your hand and have at least a lightsaber at every site.


against hidden base, spread out and put tatooine maul in space and probe everywhere, then land him and drain.


against hyperdrive i just put keder the black at the junkyard and put people’s at the adjecent sites and wait for them to come to you.


thanks =) '
