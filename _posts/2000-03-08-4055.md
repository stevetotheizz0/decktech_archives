Strategy: '

Things to do ASAP
get out the Dagobah sites
get out traffic control
get a ship to Dagobah
find Son of Skywalker
Deploy SAC counters

then...
go through the deck and pick out what you want with traffic control

this includes...
retrieving cards
the numerous effects
ground/cloud drain material at Dagobah

after you are set up you should drain for about 7~9
get your lost pile back down with on/off the edge and watch your opponent die

Come here you big coward wiil kill this deck, if there is any hint of this, deploy the ships
to Yavin4 with haven, and move to Courascant

if they start CHYBC and are playing heavy space, you're in trouble '
