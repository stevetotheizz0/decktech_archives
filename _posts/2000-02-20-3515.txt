Strategy: 

This deck has extremely high drains, along with extremely high retrieval and extremly high activation. X-treme ISB...

First off for all of those who think 24 ORS is too many, it isn't, as long as you use them right.

Start with the ISB Objective. From there get out the Tatooine sites ASAP, as you spread out your ORS and drain. With every location out with an agent at every one, you can drain for 29+. Usual starting effect is Well Guarded, to protect your duplicates from grimtaash which could hurt this deck. If you're not worried about Grimtaash or just plan on using the objective's flipped side to retrieve the ORS later, start a different effect, to fight the opponent's strategy. Security Precautions isn't necessary in this deck, and does perfectly fine without it. Resistance fights numbers, and God knows that there are enough battlegrounds in this deck to keep it out. Broken Concentration delays jedi testing, so you can drain as much as possible before test 1. Without Ghhhks in this deck, you'd die a horrible, horrible death at the mercy of an EPP beatdown deck. Abyssin Ornament= up to 25 force retrieved, nuff' said. Den Of Thieves/ABCTTU haults drains. Moderate space protection, Executor, Dengar In Punishing One, and Bossk In Hound's Tooth= power 23 + 2 battle destiny + destiny +1 for each opponent's starships present. Not too shabby.

Overall this isn't a bad deck. It's based around , basically, killing your opponent before he kills you, and when your both hurt, regenerate yourself with Abyssin Ornament.
