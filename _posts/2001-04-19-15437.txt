Strategy: 

TURN 1: 
drop down omnnious rumors on turn one. with a biker scout with a bike to endor landing platform and hopefully another system with a bounty hunter. this will give you a nice drain of 5 on turn 2. at the end of you&#8217;re turn use mobilization points to pull executor. 

TURN 2: 
with any luck you should now have enough force to drop down executor. at this point if you can get out the back door and the forest clearing. drop down establish secret base. and hold on to 4 sites. 
1. sullust 
2. endor 
3. endor:back door 
4. endor:forest clearing 
those four sites alone will give you a nice drain of 8. that should be all you need to win a drain race. 

the speeder bikes can hold them selves really well. if you elsek and avarik out with bikes and cannons on each bike and a scout blaster on each of them and a blast points and a highs pedd tactics. you’re power is 12 plus 3 destiny. they can get scary.

from this point on reinforce you&#8217;re power at those four sites. use blast points to pull blasters. as long as you&#8217;re careful you should be able to hold on to those four sites pretty well with this deck.
