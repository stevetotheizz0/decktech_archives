Strategy: '

This deck is a machine.  Basically it's just regular Ds mains and toys.  Heres why it's so good, starting with Battle plan mean sthat whoever battles best will most likely win the game.	and as you can see thi sdeck is obviously really good in a battle.
It has space power and land power.  It has space drains and land drains.  Of course it has anti revo(the obj)  and anti cheese(chybc and resistance).b	Theres really no way this deck can be beat.  Only a very good/lucky player can beat it.  SAC can be a problem but you have 2x twilek and oppresive, jsut get it out early nd let your grabbers do the work.
Against any type of mains deck just battle them out.
Against opps get decree out early and drain in space.  Against EBO just control two systems and set up decree.
Sorry the stratagy section isn't that long but the deck is pretty much self explanitory...any questions email me...'
