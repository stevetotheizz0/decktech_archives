Strategy: '

Okay, this isn't exactly tournament worthy. Just might be fun. Spread with troopers and if they battle, deploy scout blasters as a react. Then hit everyone with them. Use bikes to react with Aratech Corporation. Has drain capabilities but pretty limited. Only go to space if you have to.  '
