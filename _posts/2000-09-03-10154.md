Strategy: '

*** in response to the 6 speeders not being enough to beatdown with ***

well, they are more defensive. they are just there to provide backup for those happy little eloms, and their large drains.
--------------------------------------------


This is my combo of my favorite decks. It uses eloms, speeders, and the staging areas/insurrection combo. It can drain for quite a bit, and its power is unstoppable. It uses eloms to fight the weaknesses of speeders (they cant go inside) and speeders to fight the weaknesses of eloms (they get trampled easy). if you dont understand something, PLEASE D-MAIL ME FIRST, i will gladly answer any questions.


This deck uses the eloms with their power 4 (when with an imperial, 2 when tanus is at AC, 5 when he is at AC, and when tanus is at AC and the elom with with an imperial)

use YWTMTJN to get tessek and tanus to the AC (tessek first) so they provide their bonuses. use ben to keep them alive.

just do the obivious, this deck is pretty self-explanetory (i had 3 pages written on it, but low and behold, they got messed up by my comp yay note sarcasm)

obivious things

frozen assets + draw their fire = absolutely deadly....it is just so evil

incom corp + speeders = power 4, ability 2 fighting machines....excellent

Nar Shaddaa Wind Chimes + 9 eloms = lots of retrieved force

good ships + kessel = big drain

put the ASP droid and a lift tube at the death star DB and use the ASP droid to put the tube back on top of your deck, giving you a destiny of six for whatever destiny you are about to draw.


(sorry for the short strategy, but i had a really long one written, and it got screwed up, so if i have an inspiration (like 5 stars -) i might possibly re-write that strategy.

now for some VS on decktypes

Ralops
you can choose to invade them, with your eloms and speeders, which would probably keep them from flipping, and is a good idea. or you can just sit back and get in some early drains. a combo of early drains, and invading is probably the best idea.

Court
your AC converts theirs, so they get less activation. keep obi from getting eaten, so try to fallen portal the rancor. just try to out drain them, and if they arent packing alot of ships, drain at kessel for alot. pretty much a race to drain them before they can eat your guys.

Manip
try to keep the eloms out of your hand, as monnok hurts. onith wont hurt you with you only having three uniques, and two of them deploy right from deck (with take me to jabba now)

TIEs
a drain race. spread out on the ground and drain like crazy. let them spread thin in space, then surprize them with a fleet of ships. i want to throw in "i hope she's alright" to deal with them, but dont know what to take out, lmk. i also think that "i hope she's alright" might not work cause the eloms have a high destiny.

thank you for taking the time to read and review this deck. i spent a while on it, and got my original (or atleast i havent seen a similar one) deck idea from my favorite things, eloms and speeders. again, i am sorry about the lousy strat, but you understand the deck, right? if you dont, d-mail me BEFORE you review, and i will explain any questions you may have.
