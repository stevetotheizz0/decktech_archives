Strategy: 
Podracing is out of the Question. Lott Dod is the key to this deck (he lets you tunnel vision like a mad man)
Force Field and YOTC kills hit and runs
Against Mains: Force drain in space and fight em on the ground( Guri Prevents extra Destiny, Rune and Yeb Yeb Prevents opponents ONLY Destiny, plus the DR. kills off Han or Chewie when with DV)Don’t forget +3 to destiny -3 to destiny!!!
Against Space: Drain at the Cantina and Bust out Search and Destroy with a lil A A A  then cancel force drains with senators. 
Light Side Senate: you have to keep the Majority!!!!! Get rid of Bacta Tank with SHUOSHD, use rune and Yeb Yeb, Start the other Effect with Allegation of Corruptions( to grab Might of the Republic!!!!)
First strike with rune is a retrieval of 2 for a battle u start.When your Objective is fliped reduce opponents hand and Limited Resources him/her.

WYS:Canceling the Kessel Drain is a must, Mauls eats this deck for lunch, Dont lose your space you’ll need it trust me, Remeber to cancel force drains with senators, use some of the other strats to help you out(+3...-3)
