Strategy: '

Again, this deck went undefeated at the Ice Plains Regional, but it did lose against Yannick Lapointe's heavy manipulation deck in the finals.

Really, this deck doesn't use a single strategy. Basically, it can setup fast or slow depending on how many chances you're willing to take. The heavy SAC gives you options and most of the other cards are pretty self-explanatory. Even if you think that one starship is not enough, I've gotta tell you it is. Big Blue is not the dominant meta here and SFS is nowhere to be seen, BUT if it did come down to it, I still think this deck would kick their asses Enjoy.'
