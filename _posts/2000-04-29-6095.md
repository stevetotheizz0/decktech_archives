Strategy: '

Well This Deck uses the old school Mos Eisley Shuffle as a drain engine nothing fancy really, with Anchorhead in there to add a third site to the mix.

 Well Before I get down to draining I have to get Han back. I decided to just use EPP Han in this deck as my captive since I have no intention of waiting for me to lose 10 force before getting him back. In most cases now it seems that people aren't bothering to put down the two aliens at the AC so that's why I only have 1 Someone Who.. just in case.


 Well Once I have the Objective Flipped, have as many of the characters you can get go to Anchorhead (unless your opponent has someone there then just go to Mos Eisley)
It does take an extra turn to get your people back to anchorhead but the extra drain helps.

 Now for the reasons for some of the cards being in this deck

 2-1B Well This Is a back up just in case Ben gets 4-Lomed or something, also it subtracts 2 from the cost of bringing ppl back to your hand from the tank.

 Blaster Proficiency Add 3 to your weapon destiny with a blaster I use 3 different ones 2 of em would be +4

 HDWGITM Why Not? This thing is soo useful near the start for setting things up plus I'm using 3 droids so.

 Slight Weapons Malfunction I think this is obvious, used destiny 4, destiny adder.

 Visored Vision It's in there in case I don't have a grabber yet, and the occasional just getting rid of them because I know they will be a nuisence (like tramples, damn annoying cards)

 Scramble This is one of the best cards in the game of course I'm using it.

 Lightsaber Proficiency and Obi and Anakin's sabers Going back to the old ways of adding to drains.


 Well That's It
