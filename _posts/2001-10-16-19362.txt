Strategy: 

UPDATE:umm, I have 3 ships in here. The 2 Zuckuss go with the 2 4-LOMs. Bossk is candy. These guys can hold any 
system, but if space is common around you, by all means put in IG and some others. It Couldn’t HOIT!

This deck plays pretty easily, basically play Watto alone at the Junkyard and stock up a couple of tough guys at Mos Espa. Emperor and Janus with Mara are ideal, as that gets you a drain of 3. DO NOT REINFORCE WATTO. When they come after you, lose Watto and Whatever force, then proceed to beat the heck out of them. Thats why I use Young Apprentice over Darth Maul Tat. He is simply a better beatdown machine than Tat Maul. This deck plays the same against everyone. The only changes I could see would be if you see a lot of Dagocheese in you area, work in Search and Destroy(maybe for Aurra) and a Projective Telepathy(maybe for Fett or an Alter) Thanks for your instructive reviews, or something.
