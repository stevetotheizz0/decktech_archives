Strategy: '

Well the strategy for this deck is pretty much the same as every other Hunt Down deck.  Duel, Beatdown, and slow death to Visage.  Obviously start with Bad feeling Have I or Crush the Rebellion depending on their deck.	For EBO battle in space, but don't let them drop all their ships on you at one time.

in response to reviews the destiny isn't bad, I only need One circle and One VO, track the Masterful Moves, cancel their duel destiny w/ Tarkin, maybe even a focused attack, no way you can lose a duel.
Force Field is obviously to keep Vader alive through all the mains shooting and slashing at him.  It is a great card, so don't scoff at it. '
