Strategy: 

Well the strategy for this deck is pretty much the same as every other Hunt Down deck.  Duel, Beatdown, and slow death to Visage.  Obviously start with Bad feeling Have I or Crush the Rebellion depending on their deck.	For EBO battle in space, but don't let them drop all their ships on you at one time.

in response to reviews: the destiny isn't bad, I only need One circle and One VO, track the Masterful Moves, cancel their duel destiny w/ Tarkin, maybe even a focused attack, no way you can lose a duel.
Force Field is obviously to keep Vader alive through all the mains shooting and slashing at him.  It is a great card, so don't scoff at it.
