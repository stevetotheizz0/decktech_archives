PLEASE READ THE STRAT

maybe Ill think up a different title next time... 3 decks with practically the same name is kinda pushing it...
)

I HAVE NOT WRITTEN ANYTHING HERE OUT OF MERE SPECULATION UNLESS NOTED IN THE STRATEGY.
all of these matchups have come from firsthand experiance

hmmm... some of you say that broken concentration is too card intensive, others say test one will kill me, even though concentration IS ALREADY IN HERE.  wow.

Alright you guys make it sound like I have to have everything out to make this work.  The AO is nice, but not absolutely necessary.  RBO is nice, but not necessary.  I have won many games without getting either of these out.  And besides, with Drop, I can move through my deck pretty quickly.

I HAVE NEVER LOST TO QMC  man, that is all you guys can say.  lol.  Pucumir is not that hard to kill.  And I dont need to kill him if imp decree is out.  My direct damage will catch up to him, and secret plans will hurt his retrieval.  If he does pay for it, that leaves less for other things coughmainscoughcough and lets me drop maul w/ saber and vader w/ saber down.  Arica does nicely too. 

I have NEVER seen a patrol craft around here.  And I can beat the crap outta it just as easily.

Menace Fades can be annoying, but it doesnt really matter with all the great direct damage anyways.  I don’t know how many times I have to say it, but I don’t really care if they do run menace fades. 


 tip of the day
Echo Base Sensors only works if the north ridge is on the table. guess what. unless they start careful planning (which would mean EB sensors isnt out anyways), they cant deploy the 4th marker because the 5th marker IS ALREADY OUT  If the 1st marker is out, then the 4th marker is deployed from reserve deck at the start IF there is not already a 4,5,or 6 marker out. Jeesh. Read the card guys. 
AND the 1st marker has to be out also. Read the generator rules guys. please. for your sake and mine.

 next tip of the day
uh, guys, they dont drain for much on CC if I have Imp decree out.  My walkers can beat the living daylights outta any epp, Ive done so amny times before.  Jquille gets rid of chewies and other annoying cards, and walkers still beatdown like crazy.  trample kills spies, and my destinies arent THAT bad.

Menace fades is snnoying, as I state in another passage, but not crippling as I syill get lotsa direct damage going.


Executor is not in here for the sole reason that it is so expensive.  The chimera gets the job done jsut as well, and it costs 3-6 less, depending on which version of executor is being considered.  the current fleet goes for power 29 and 2 destinies, 3 if thrawn is up.  that is enough to make the opponent think twice about attacking.  the destroyers are prett easy to get out too, with the new walker effect.

Activation can be a pain at times, but the 3 dbs and 3rd marker plus whatever other sites I can pull are usually enough to do what I need to do.  Just 1 or two from them is enough to help out A LOT. 




Well not too many changes from last post, which got up pretty high in the rankings for a while. Just a little more stream-lining. 

First off, here is my sermon. 
This is quite possibly the most versatile deck type out there. With tons of direct damage and the extra possiblity of huge drains, there is quite a good chance of winning. I mean, with No Escape and Secret Plans, there is practically no way to cancel the direct damage and no easy way to do retrieval circles. 

Profit? Wow I do alot more damge than you will ever do. 

MWYHL? uh, broken (concentration).  And, uh, theres a story behind this one.  I was playing court agaisnt MWYHL, and he trained like mad and got done quickly.  He cam to me and kept killing all my guys with test 5 7s and retrieving with On The edge.  It was insane.  Fortunately, I managed to get a timed win after I knocked out SIX OF HIS SEVEN (wow I still dont believe it) of his characters, and brought down xizor on boushh to deny him a battle destiny.  It was completely insane.  AND I captured the Luke he trained .  Never got to feed him, though...hehe. Anyways...

EBO? Only 5 hoth sites needed you say? and Imperial decree? BTW, not too many EBO decks around here have enough ground power to deal with walkers breathing down their necks. Not that there are many EBOs around here anyways.  AND their pretty little echo base sensors wont work. 

AITC? Yeah, right. Hah. Thats funny just thinking about it. 

MBO? I used to play this, and its not that hard to beat lol. Ahh, memories... those were the days... anyways... 

Senate? how much damage can they REALLY do? 

Honor? No Escape and Presence, yep. 

Hidden Base? Ok so you only lose 10+ every turn instead of 17. Oh well. And they cant cancel the direct damage w/ the obj. Come on now. My damage gets going faster than theirs, and the new walker effect keeps my drains from being canceled.  Hidden mains should be fun, it really is suprising how fast walkers can build up power. 

Endor Bunker? Well, THEORETICALLY this can cause problems, as they dump my hand and get to beef up their characters and their drains. However, the one bunker deck I have played with this I beat by garrisoning the heck out of them.  I can be set up with several walkers byt the time they blow. The person has to be decently good for this to be a big problem. And YES, I can handle the 16 force swing. 

QMC? Lets see. I have imp decree, they have menace fades (if they dont theyre dead anyways). I have direct damge and honor stoppers, they have, uh, drains(which I have too, BTW. And bigger ones at that). Against a GOOD player, might be hard but otherwise I think Im fine. Last time I played this, Imp decree destroyed and mutilated pucumir. AND I controled Bespin the whole game pretty much. 

WYS? Might be hard, but I can play come here ya big coward (Def SH) to help with retrieval and I can outdrain them. And trust me, with imperial command AND the admirals orders, battle destinies will not be a big problem.

Duel of the Fates? This is the one deck that I am actually worried about.  Their early drains might be enough to make me worry, and it will be hard to combat, even with maul and saber.  Possibly just try to drop maul, vader, and a couple other mains to beat up a lone qui gon or something. 

Other than the new objective, there arent really any new cards that can hurt this deck. Maybe things like battle plan being played as a shield, the new mains MAYBE could cause a little trouble, but not that much different from other beatdown decks Ive already played. All in all, R3 didnt affect this much other than to make it better. If you guys can remind me of something I forgot, I will be sure to add it in.

Well there arent a whole lot of other dominant Light deck types out there. Of course, this deck wont go undefeated forever. There is always someone, but YMSYL is definately one of the most solid choices available. 
Well, thats my ten cents. 


Depending on what they play, Ne Escape may be switched out for 
Imp Decree (EBO or another drain deck)
PFA surface attack (Hidden base)



PRE-ACTIVATION 
Pull 3rd marker and walker garrison 
Pull piet or Veers depending on situation if you have imp command. 

1st TURN 
Pull executor docking bay (preferably) after activating. Drop any sites in hand.  If they are activating a miniscule amount or you know they wont drop anything to your site, put someone at 3rd marker to get early drains.  Assuming you can back him up later.

LATER ON.... 
Drop guys and AT-ATs to 3rd marker, beef it up. If you feel like a wuss, put them at 5th marker, but wheres the fun in that? ) 
Try to get set up for walker garrison, as a few of those can make the hoth blues turn into some serious frostbite. 
Watch out for spies, dont leave some scrub alone at the 5th marker. Heh, first-hand experiance right here.(DOH) 

WAY LATER ON... 
Garrison. This card will make the game when you play it. That is why there are 3. If one makes it a close game, 2 will finish it and it is halarious to see the opponents face when you show them the third that is in your hand. By end game, you should be spread out at most of your sites making them lose a heckload of force. RBO is nice, but not necessary. 



DECK NOTES 

*Admirals Orders gives battle destiny protection and pulls walkers. 

* Only 2 non pilots 
Mosep  who would want to lose 10+ off the top of the reserve deck?? 
JQuille  power 6, can exclude characters.  

*Igar adds a destiny on ALL non unique walkers (=2 battle destinies on imperial walkers). 

*Drop serves as Reactor Terminal. You can drop 3 EVERY control phase, and it serves as a used monnok of sorts. Only disadvantage is that it deploys for 3 instead of 1.  

*3 twileks to pull all the important effects, and the are VERY important indeed. 

*Imperial decree kills revo. 

*Even if the drains are reduced, the direct damage and remaining drains are still quite potent and able to do some serious hurtin. 

*I cannot overstress the importance of garrison. Even If I can only use 2 in a game (realistically), they are still good for drain fodder and pulling walkers. 

Well there ya go. Nearly undefeated in tourney play so far, close to it in pick up games.  Dont write it off on some stupid excuse, plz tell me what I need to do to improve.

Thx for your reviews.
