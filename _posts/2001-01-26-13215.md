Strategy: '

Well, first off I know your thinking, what the (*^? Yeah I know what your thinking. BEfore you say different, I DO have enough ships in here. All I need to do is draw either the ship or the pilot, and you can deploy it. The free Owen/lars/hravest tech is sweet. You can set up your big guys on the groung ( luke, lando, CHewie, Talon,) and drain. Then Set up your ships in space. Make shure you don’t sprea out too much, cause big beatdowns suck. The Flip side of the deck is such a B*tch. You can play harvest twice, COntol twice, and any other big interupt twice. This can come in HANDY> You may think Secret plans eats this alive, but it really doesn;t. YOu onlt retive about 4 force from harvest, so your ussually have it. Grapple can be a whore, but remember, Harvest isnt tthe whole point of the deck. here are some deck matchups

COURT Get your drains going in space. Make shure you get abilty 7 so zukus wont be gay. Then deploy big and beadown at the audience chamber. Drain, Retvieve, not a hard game.

TIES Deploy space only at crucial times. Grapple All power to weapons. Retrival will help you out big time.

HUNTDOWN Cancel visage with Trans. Term. Get luke out and kill vader if they come for luke. Drain in space and retive to win.

ANYTHING ELSE React to what opponent does.
