Strategy: '

Here is the basic strategy...blow up alderraan ASAP, and then go from there doing whatever u need to kill certain decks
EBO...blow up hoth...as soon as this is done, then the game is urs, considerign they lose a lot of their power and drain bonuses...also use its worse if they try to play it could be worse
Ops...blow up the subjagated planet and out drain them...this is an easy matchup
Throne Room Mains..blow up yavin, and then out drain...couldnt be simpler
New DS 2 obj...never let ur imperials at sited...put them all on ships as forfiet fodder as u out drain them in space
MBO....use the death star assult squad to stop that, and then blow up yavin, and out drain
Profit...start Mara and Fett and reinforce asap and outdrain them in space
MWYHL...blow up Alderaan, and then out drain and conquer in space...you should win
Any other deck, just blow up Alderaan and outdrain...

I am welcome to any comments that u might have to this deck, for this is my first attempt at one...thank u all

Props go to Tarkinsaide for the idea for this deck...his was the basic layout for mine
