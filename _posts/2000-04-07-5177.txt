Strategy: 

Vs. HDADTJ I start with YH and Goo. Fear not the duel, feel the force and allow your lightsaber to cut through Vader's suit with Courage.

Vs Ops or ROps just mass your force pile and beat 'em down as soon as you can. Against ROps I like to revo the forest and fortify it through out the game. I then control the site with a sugnificant strike team thus supressing their objective.

VS. Big Blue ... uh... no one realy plays big blue here in Vegas... Maybe I should start a trend... muhahahaha!!!

I had made a couple of changes since posting. Obi's Ghost was replaced by another DFTD, and I added a disruptor pistol just for op decks. Also added a falcon and switched DOS for another Leia W/gun.
