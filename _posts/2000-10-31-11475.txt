Strategy: '

This is just a normal Eops deck.  Lose YCHF to take Perimeter Patrol into hand so the Rebel’s will think twice before deploying to Endor.  Ominous Rumours lets you have drains 2 plus, so control as many Endor sites as you can.  I use
Mob. Points so I can have enough force to deploy all of my Sd’s.  I have two Merrijeck’s so I can pull my sites quickly and get all of the 0 destinies out.  This deck did 1-2 at the most recent tournament, but take into consideration that it was my first tournament.  Sorry there isn’t more strategy but I’m pretty new. '
