Strategy: 

	Version 2 of my favorite deck.	Doubled up on the rancor and fett (he gives me great retrieval on bounties).  The most important change was the addition of prepared defenses to replace twilek.
   The basic idea behind this deck is to capture my opponents characters, retrieve bounties on them for force, and then feed them to the Sarlacc.  That gives me more force retrieval as well as placing them out of play, and hurting my opponent with force loss.  The idea is to flip the objective, feed the prisoners, and then flip it back so I am back to the great front side.
   I start prepared defenses to pull All Wrapped Up and There Is No Try every game.  Against EBO or a deck that I fear quick drains I start Battle Order (I should not have trouble with this, as I can pull BH ships from reserve deck).  Any other times I start first strike.
   I have six cards to capture characters during battles.  The two capturing guns go on fett and jodo.	Jodo gets the riot gun, on him, it fires for free, has destiny +5!  It is rare that I even need a destiny of great than 0 to capture someone.  He can also be targeted by hidden weapons, which is a great card.  The only way that hidden weapons does not get a hit, is if the destiny is 0-1, anything above either captures, hits, or immediately kills.  Fett gets the stun gun, which is best when targeting bounty.  Fett is the one who I usually have gathering bounties anyway, which makes this the perfect weapon for him.	He too can be targeted by hidden weapons.  The Mandalorian armor gives another hunter the ability to use hidden weapons.  IG and Bossk each have permanent weapons that can capture.  If by some chance anyone does not get captured in the battle, all wrapped up cleans them up afterward.
   I use direct damage a lot in this deck.  Drains can be modified, but direct damage is hard to stop.	Court has its own damage, which should bring my opponent to me.  When s/he does, it is time for me to begin the kill.  Tatooine occupation is pretty self-explanatory.	Another great card that gives direct damage is search and destroy.  This is great against EBO, which pretty much abandons the ground.  It causes force loss during every draw phase, including mine.  This makes it just as good as visage.  It is also a great card against x/b/a-wing swarm that has almost no ground ability.
   Ill no explain some of the other cards.  The executor may be expensive to deploy, but it is well worth the cost.  I put it at Tatooine with anything else and my occupation is safe.  Nal Hutta is great for pulling bounties.  I do not have to even occupy the system, and it is only a drain of 1 for my opponent.  The docking bays can be pulled at the beginning and allow me to get to wherever my opponent is.  The rancor is in this deck instead of the Sarlacc for several reasons.  First, it is much easier to feed the rancor.  Instead of moving from the dungeon or audience chamber, outside, and then to the Sarlacc pit, I can simply dump them after getting my bounty.	The rancor retrieve more force in most situations, especially if the card is a main, which I will primarily be feeding.  The rancor also does not miss.  It is next to impossible to feed luke or obi to the rancor, even leia, Orrimaarko, melas or tawass are next to impossible.  The rancor makes it so even luke jedi has to draw two higher than me to even survive.
   Lateral Damage is great against home one.  The high power ship suddenly becomes power and forfeit 0.  Who cares about its high immunity to attrition, let it stay!  It just gives me more time to pound it with everything I have got.  I put the lateral damage on Nal Hutta and suddenly its going to be a while before the ship is able to fight again.  If I am fighting at Tatooine or farther away and my opponent has no other systems closer to Nal Hutta then it is not going to get any better.  There is no try makes it difficult for my opponent to cancel it, and even if they do, it makes them pay.
   Battle order works great against an EBO or hidden base deck.  Working with courts damage and search and destroy, they now are losing three force each of their turns, plus using three force to drain each time.  A great combination.
   Evader is used against choke decks.
   This deck is one of my favorites.  Bounty hunters give great power and even greater game texts.  This trait makes them what I consider the best cards in the game.  The deck combines great land and good space, great retrieval and direct damage, plus good drains.  It is a balanced deck that wont be taken by surprise by anything.
