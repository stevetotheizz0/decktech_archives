Strategy: '

This deck is basicly a number hidden base deck. It uses the spies to go undercover and cancel drains and to stop some objectives. It uses the interrupts to help you do many things but mainly for protection so you dont have to battle as much.
the two artoo's are in there for spies and for their powerful abilities. Oola can take out some big characters and really hamper a dark side mains deck. you usually start with haven but battle plan and rebel fleet can be good replacements.

VS. OPS
Start battle plan. set up in space and send a beatdown squad to make life bad for those puny operatives.

VS. Huntdown
use the transmission terminated or undercover to cancel visage, and try to get luke down.

VS. ECC
get the undercover spies down fast so they cant flip the objective.

VS. EJP
set up a big squad and come down and kill them. make sure high ability characters are their so they dont get captured. also try to keep a it could be worse in hand so they dont use security precautions and deploy a ship and ruin you.

I have been using this deck and it works rather well. I would like some feedback so I can make it even better. '
