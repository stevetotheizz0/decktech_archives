Strategy: '

Realized I made some errors on the card list. Junland waste isn't LS duh So put Tatooine Jabba's Palace there.  And Hiding In The Garbage should be No Disintegrations  sorry my bad	)






Now depending what the DS deploys for Objective.  If they play one decides how you start.  But normally just play a tat site and careful planning for the other.  Sometimes you may deploy planet the planning for site.

This deck has doubles for the reason of getting them when you need them.  Both spaceships can complete the kessel run.	Both have immunity to attrition.  So you can go to the air if you need to.  If the walkers come out...or AT-ST then go with the snow speeders for moving across the globe.  Then of course there are the big beat done characters.

There are 3 ways to retrieve force.  Kessel Run, harvest or reflection.  So usually one of these works without a hitch.

Before you go and deploy like crazy see what the DS is doing and figure out where to do the most damage.  If he's going heavy bounty hunting.	Sit a starship at ord-mandel, if he's going with hunt down make sure you have the few safety cards in your hand incase.  If DS hit the ground with the big machines.  You'll have to do a big ambush and force retrieve your losses.

There are cards in the deck that slow down or stop some popular decks but I know not all cards can be included.  I'm sure I forgot some but, I haven't found trouble as of yet.

Thanks for you time, and the review.
