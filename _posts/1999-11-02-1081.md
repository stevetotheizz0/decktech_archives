Strategy: '


This is a great lockdown deck, and is especially tough against ISB decks, because they must start with a Coruscant location, Hunt Down decks, which start with the Executor locations, and DS space decks starting with Wakeelmui.  Early revolutions put the hurt on the DS meanwhile the LS sets up a powerful force for battling.  Late in the game the Revolutions can be used to turn Obi-Wan&#8217;s Hut and the Massassi Ruins into huge force drain locations.  The monks make any Tatooine location a battleground nullifying Come Here You Big Coward.

This deck is chock full of surprises for the DS.  The Mos Eisley free move to the Cantina can put a game away if the opponent is unprepared.  Sorry About The Mess and Clash Of Sabers make it a dangerous combination.  Scramble is exceptional when combined with Draw Their Fire.  I usually save it for a critical battle when I try to go for the jugular.

Darth Vader has his hands full trying to Hunt Down Luke and Ben.  Courage Of A Skywalker and Glancing Blow threaten to put Vader out of the game.

I put in the four It Could Be Worse to help against DS space decks and deal with miscellaneous damage, especially 3720 to 1.
