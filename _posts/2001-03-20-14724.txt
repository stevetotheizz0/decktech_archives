Strategy: 

This deck is a good dueling deck.And forgive me for that old deck.This deck alows you to have a good space and a good ground assult.You want to get your vaders down as fast as posible.But try and make shure you have a duling card in your hand.And make shure you have a Tarkin with him so if he plays luke or Obie down you can start a battle.During that battle start a duel.Tarkin can cancel one of there destiney draws sens it is during a battle so your are almost garitined to win the dule.Thene forc drain him to the max. My 2nd deck so go easy plz.
