Damned Theres an error in the decklist. Innocent scoundrel is supposed to be Keep your eyes open.
Greetings to the guy who wants to use innocent scoundrel in his ewok deck none the less.

This deck has more tech than any other deck I ever saw.
The deck is not supposed to flip until the end of the game unless youre forced to do so. Start should be Wise Advice if you think Sense/Alter, else Battle Plan.
Tibrin is key to this deck, as is Order to engage. You have a good activation to be able to track destinies, either used interrupts or cards you saw with Figrin Dan, thats what he is good for.
The mega falcon can take out every ship, even the executor. Just before the end of the game opponent should not have anything left in space. Thats when you flip to retrieve everything with our most desperate hour.
Yodas gimer stick + Order to engage + Under attack is just the ultimate combo.
