Strategy: '

Basically, u set up by getting your senators to the senate, getting your systemâ€™s out, then draining and retrieving at the same time with Yarua. Hes the man, and dont worry about dark side space, in type 2 its usually always senate, there are multiple copies of the main ssenators so they will always be in the senate. That is basically all, its that easy to play, just drain and retrieve, bingo bango.
