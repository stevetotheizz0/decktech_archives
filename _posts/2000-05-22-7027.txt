Strategy: '

It should be pretty self explanatory, but I'll explain it anyway.
Use Imp. ArrestOrder to pull out a docking bay each turn. Use
the non-unique site on Tatooine, or if playing against
Hidden Base, use it as a site for a planet opponet
put down so that you can land ships and pick up/
drop off outer rim scouts.

Put Jabba(using this Jabba cause he adds 2 to ORS
forfeit, and makes Scum/Villany hard to cancel)
and Bekan at the audience chamber with Scum and Villany.
Put the ORS's at all the docking bay's minimum of 2 at each
for a destiny draw. If opponet tries to battle, use
Stunning Leader to cancel it if you are overpowered
(use judgement on which to battle in) or use it
to cancel a battle you intiate so that you can take
the two force from Scum/Villany and not lose a battle.
Use the Ornament to get back massive force.
Freeze will help if there is a battle against the
ORS's a little bit. No other characters in here
cause they aren't needed. Docking bay transit
is the way to move around in this deck.

Torture against numbers decks.

Only one well guarded cause the ORS's should be
down on table fast. Reactor Terminal is in all
my DS decks. Otherwise, there are no expendable
cards to take out for others, the 8 Stunning
Leaders are very necessary.

I thank everyone in advance for their reviews,
good or bad.	 '
