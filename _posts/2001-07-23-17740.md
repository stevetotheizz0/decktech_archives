Strategy: '

This is my first time submitting a deck, so any and all help is wanted.

Basically, before you activate, use A New Secret Base (ANSB) to get the Command Center and Echo Base Garrison (EBG) or if you have plenty of characters get the Echo Corridor. Play EBG and use it to grab any of the characters to play or just deploy the sites and characters to them.

Second turn, if you got EBG, use ANSB to get Corridor and Echo Base Operations. Otherwise, get EBO and the Docking Bay. Throw an X-Wing at the Docking Bay and play EBO.

If you still dont have everything out, use ANSB to pull the Docking Bay on turn three then play EBO.

Now, have fun. Keep using EBG to pull the rest of the guys and ANSB to get the systems starting with Hoth. Have a field day with X-wings and your other ships.

Haven - put it on Hoth and now pilots deploy for -2 and ships for -3.

Strike Planning - Get Rieekan down so now opponent cant cancel EBO unless he dies. Mon Mothma can grab the Incom Engineer. When placed at the DB with the Bantha Droid (Grabbed with EBG), all X-Wings are immune to attrition <5.

Reflection - Helps to retrieve every turn. Pull it with Leia.

Leia of Alderaan - Place her on a ship anywhere before EBO, and X-Wings deploy for free there. After EBO, they deploy for negative 1. Pull with Leia.

All Wings Report In - Retrieve up to 7 force when it’s really needed.

Basically, force drain like mad [5 at Coruscant, 5 at Kessel, and 4 on Kashyyyk, Raithal, and Hoth (pulled with ANSB)].


Ive really only played it against my other deck Set Your Course For Alderaan. My only advice for that is get your sites out faster than they can get theirs so when they Commence Primary Ignition its hard for them to even blow up Alderaan. You can get the ships out faster and cheaper so FD before they even get there.
