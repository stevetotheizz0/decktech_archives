Strategy: 

Use the tempest scouts to Drain on tatooine and get occupation working if some mains come to beat on you use one of the defensive card in here or just react to the battle and after there move phase start a sandwwirl.
Next time i go to my local card shop i will look for some more Tatooine deserts so as soon as they deploy stuff bam plop it down.
