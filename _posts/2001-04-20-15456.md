Strategy: '

***NOTE***

I dont’t have Tala 1, Tala 2, or Blount.  


To ion cannon The DS can draw multiple destinies.  ECC 4-Lom, Mighty Jabba, ECC IG, and many more.



Ahh, I love this deck.  I love the setup and what it can do.  


Cards


Access Denied to stop 3,720 to 1.  I like it better then YISYW(plus I don’t have YISYW)


Turns Pull COK, pull Wuta, pull a site.  2nd turn, pull Midge, get a ship out.  3rd turn, pull Brooks Carlson, and by now you should have out Gen. Solo. 4th turn, get out another scout, flip.

5th turn, drain for about 5-6.  Retrieve a scout.

7th turn through the rest of the game just drain and retrieve.  I usually win by 10, 15, 20, or higher.


I don’t blow up the Generator because it is too card extensive, but it can help.  I use to blow it up and on one turn, I blew it up they lost 8, and then I drained for 12.  20 force, boom.


I was thinking about putting in Admiral Ackbar to get out my AO faster, so please let me know if I should in the review.


Otherwise, this deck is pretty basic.  


Vs BHBM You win, drain and kick @$$.  You have no luke, so they can’t flip.  If they duel obi, that is fine.  They get a beatdown next turn from my scouts. 


Vs Court Go to space and drain on the ground.  Usually, they have no ships or weak ones, so just attrition them away.  Control Tatooine if you see Tatooine Occupation coming.


Vs MKOS Same as court


Vs HD  Tough.  I have only played one, and only won by 4.


Any other deck, just drain and retrieve.  '
