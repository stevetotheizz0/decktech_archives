Strategy: '

Ok..a different type of Anti-Hunt down that also is balanced against pretty much everything. Im trying to fit in Battle Plan(surprise assault and another signal would be nice too) and this deck will go to waste when Crush the Rebellion hits the street..but I do have a tourney before then.
Heres how it works.

Against HuntDown~ Well...this is what its for. Start Goo Nee Tay, yank Bespin to give yourself a bit of a Force Advantage. Dig for Revo's, Spies, Out of Commisions and hold your mains until you can deploy away from Vader or have a courage. Beware Elis/YAB and protect your spies well. Get em undercover if possible. Thinking with your stomach if possible...its just nasty.

Against Ops~ You have nice activation with Dag/Cave first turn and Destiny Adders will help alot (In case it wasnt in decklist I have DTF/FA in my latest version.)Swoops help big.

Against Big Blue~ Oola, Oola then Drop Destiny Adders against what they do deploy.

Against ISB~ Work the Activation/Main beatdown and follow with your Swoops

Quite frankly...those are the only DS dominant decks at the moment (variations of the above)Drazin has died and until ECC/JP Bounty Hunters wont be that strong.'
