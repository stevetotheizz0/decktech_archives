Strategy: 

Ok, this is the revised version 2.0 of my previous dark side deck. I´ve really attend to all the advices people send me in the last submission, and I think this is even better than the other. I hope you men will think so either.
Please, read this till the end and rate it. Suggestions will be wellcomed.

This is a Dark Deal dark side deck, I´m sure you´ve seen lots of this, but my deck has some cards that are no very common here in Decktech, so I will comment nearlly every card (no all the characters because they are quite obvious).
As you start with one site (1/0) and a starfighter, you must search only for another site, and thanks to the objective you must have Dark Deal, CC Occupation, Bespin: Cloud City and Bespin in very few turns (3 or 4 are good) so by turn 5 you MUST have flip the objective.

The starting hand.
Why Any Methods and no Prep Defs? Because this way you start with one of the three sites necessary to deploy Dark Deal and with a big ship such Zuckuss in Mist Hunter. You lost the possibility of deploying 3 effects, but in this deck is better something like this hand.

The Blue Section
Too many ships? I don´t think so. I´ve lost many games because I wasn´t able to defend Cloud City and/or Bespin. Now, with all the Ties and the Dark Maneuvers & Tallon Roll combo card, I will.
The Chimera gives me the heavy support as with Thrawn and Palleon as pilots is really BIG. The Bonty Hunters in their ships provide support for both the ties and Chimera, and for desperate moments, Xizor in Virago is the last ship you must deploy.
As many of my sites are interior ones, I´ve chosen Lift Tubes as they move as reacts and have destiny of 6.

The Character Section
Really need explanation about this?

The Red Section
Dark Maneuvers & Tallon Roll: kill op dangerous ships, and big destiny.
Force Lighting: a good killing character card.
Ommni Box & It´s Worse: anti those #%&@$ It could Be Worse. and a recicle destiny 5 card, great!.
Limited Resources: to end a hard game.
All Power To Weapons: surprise!!!.
Imperial Command: search for Thrawn, Motti, etc.
Hutt Smooch: anti TK422 or Boush or any other spy.

I don´t think the other cards need axplanations, but I will be gratefull to explain them to anyone who needs more about them.

Against The Decks
AITC: play as allways and win him.
HB: against swarms play Tallon Roll like mad, and against mains you have enought ships to deffend yourself and find out the hidden base so you will outdrain him. It´s a difficult play anyway.
EBO: pray you start the Dark Deal sooner so you outdrain him before he does. Very difficult.
WYS: not problems aginst this one I hope.
MWYHL: really a great game, but as you have many locations to drain at least 1 (2 in Downtown Plaza), you must drain him more than he might stop, and you have Secret Plans to help you a little.
Rescue Han: nothing to do against you and this super-powerfull characters deck. Kill Han and any other stupid he can throw you!.

That´s all I hope. As said above suggestion will be wellcomed. Thanks in advance for reading it till the end.
