Strategy: 

The Strategy is simple, drain, and make them deploy half your stuff. The Destroyers are a key element in allowing this deck to function properly.If you can get 2 or 3 shots in at your opponent in a battle, not to mention 2 swings, your well on your way 
 a well-centered beatdown.Here are some decks I&#8217;ve played against:

WHT/DOTF: A hard deck to play, because depending on who gets what out fiirst, you could be running to them, or they could be running to you.The key to facing this deck is to put Maul and back-up at a Naboo site and make them pay 2 or lose 2 every turn. 
u need to always get a space drain going early, because most EP:1 decks don&#8217;t carry alot of space.

Senate: I&#8217;ve never worried much of senate decks. If I can make them deploy my stuff for me and slow down the senate, i can get a good drain early and keep it for the game. I can let them have one site, and then drain at others and in space.

Those are the 2 most common decks in my area.

In adding/subtracting cards, you could take out a Maul or Droid ship or Destroyer to add senate backup if you felt it nessicary, but I have found that this combination of cards usually works very well.
