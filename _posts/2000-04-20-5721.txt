Strategy: 

I start S&V because I have 2 copies of All Wrapped Up (otherwise, I'd start with that)
Oo-ta Goo-ta Solo?: capture those nabruning mains.
Endor Occupation: stop the opponent from celebrating
Its Worse: counter one of the most popular LS interrupts
Hutt Smooch: capture Boussh, TK-422, or Artoo w/ A Gift
Hidden Weapons: a way of capturing/killing characters
Elis Helrot: if your opponent is on another planet.
Twi'lek Advisor: Get out those effects faster
Ghhhk: in case if you're ever super-outpowered, helps vs. EPP beatdown crews
Bad Feeling Have I: makes it harder for them to get a beatdown crew
First Strike: use with S&V-another retrieval engine
Quick Reflexes: you can lose hidden weapons and dengar's riot gun and still kick butt
Expand the Empire: old-skool alien deployment(w/audience chamber)
All Wrapped Up: A must for this deck
Resistence: I hate inserts
Dengar's Modified Riot Gun: use with Jodo Kast. Come here Yoda :)
Skiff: to protect your characters from the Sarlacc
Bubo: keep people where you need them, eat spies
ZiMH: you only have 6 ability? what a pity
Bossk In Bus: one extra destiny
BFiS1: Immunity to attrition and a battle destiny.
Bossk w/ Gun: capture time
Iggy w/ Gun: see above
Mosep/ Galid: force drain bounuses
Ephant: keep spies out of the audience chamber
Bane Malar: scan Chewie :)
4-LOM w/ gun: cancel game text :)

vs. Profit: start Mara and Chall. Use Chall to pull CCEngineer, convert their AC, then pull an alien of your choice
vs. Hidden Base: probe w/ the ships.
vs. MWYHL:force drain the heck out of them
vs. Yavin 4 choke: just stay on planet, let them come to you.  Start All Wrapped Up instead of S&V, since they can cancel S&V the first turn.

That's all the types I've seen at tourneys around here, I think.
If you tell me what to put in, tell me what to take out in its place
Thanx,
