Strategy: 

first off I will not be playin this til Tattoine comes out (Great Shot Kid). in playing this I have found it most effective against MKOS (no space). it’s great make’in the oppenent lose 16 force in one turn. SYCFA tie’s would hurt, but tycho does not have to move to the Death star. tycho in r2 w/ ship is what you use. most decks can’t hold on after you blow it up. why revealed?
jade will kill your tech’s. aquaris? 3 drian help ageinst ties.

match ups:

SYCFA/ties
they probley will not come after you on the ground it so wait till your set up on the ground. deploy cracken in tala 1 or green squd 3 with tycho. then luke (farm) and R2 in ship (and proton torps). move into the trench draw two d’s 4 for sites +3 (6 if gospic) for techs + 2 for HQ +1 for breifing room + 4 for luke -1 for Tie pilot. thats 13(or 14)-16( or 17) if  >15 they lose 10 force.

BHBM
setting up is harder then most but once you blow it up and start to drain it is over. plus the fact that almost nobody plays this makes it a rare incounter. kill there emperor /w epp luke then give them LS,RS at that point you should have almost every thing set up to blow it up. deploy tycho and wedge let wedge kill it then start to drian. 14 then 8 a turn hurts alot. you might have imp command to deal with but then you don’t have multi destinys

Hunt Down
almost the same as BHBM kill them with damage Run luke run will save you some grief.

court/MKOS 
court will have space. Mkos will cancle drians use manace fades to cancle +drians. kill the DS and drain.


when the new card comes out I will incorperate cuisers. this deck has a good chance. useful idea’s are needed.
