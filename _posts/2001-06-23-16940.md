If The Trace Was Correct




'

Strategy: '

Right from the start I pull If The Trace was Correct and start a podrace in a couple of turns. I haven’t lost a podrace in my meta yet. Then I load up on sites that yield big force drains,( Cantina,Mos Espa, Landing Site when i get maul out.) Give my characters they’re lightsabers and add up on the drains. And if they even think about puting Padme’ on table, Maul will duel they’re jedi’s and let battle take care of the rest.


Against


RST Finish the Podrace and stack up on Endor, Drain on Tatooine.


QMC Finish the Podrace, Beatdown and Drain on Cloud City.


Hidden Base Podrace,Deploy enough space to take care of 1 planet, force Drain on Tatooine.  '
