Strategy: 

Sorry, if there were errors, I had to use Notepad.

This deck is a machine. I love it. Of course you can start whatever effect you see fit. I have made notes of the cards you may be clueless about.

Vs. HB: Drain on the ground, Battle Order, and Probe with the ships. Not a really hard game.

Vs. Numbers: Torture them.

Vs. Profit: Easy game, Start Mara Jade and Boelo. Pray for an early Palace and convert their site. Place Han out with Jerriko if you can.

Vs. New RTP: Place Leia out of play with Jerriko and then drain and battle.

Vs. TrM: Dominate space, Battle Order, and Jerriko to out of play mains. Battle them a lot too.

Vs. Operatives: Battle Order, battle them, drain them, and smack them around.

Vs. other stuff: Battle and drain, place out of play, etc,...

I guarantee, I have forgotten something because it's right on the edge of my mind. Just tell me and I'll post it.
