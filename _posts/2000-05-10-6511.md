Strategy: '

You all know the strategy...Interrogation Array makes opponents lose force for captives at prisons and it lets me pull Torture and Aii Aaaaa Agggggg, which also lets me make them lose force.	S & V plus First Strike rules  I retrieve 3 force per battle, as well as whatever I get from the Sarlacc.	I know I have no ships, but Search and Destroy and the obj force the opponent to make himself vulnerable.

I think it's a fun deck, and it's pretty effective, especially of you get Obi-wan or Luke out of play.  I am always open to suggestions, it only makes me better, so suggest away.

Thanks   '
