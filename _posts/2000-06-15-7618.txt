Strategy: 

Alright, make your starting effect whatever you want(narrow escape and rebel barrier piss me off)like secret plans when you play against profit.  You wanna blow alderaan away as soon as possible in order to flip.  Once flipped then drop your star destoyers at Endor and Kiffix for a drain of 4 each, enhance them with Presence of the Force if you like. A Day Long Remembered is a great tech card if you can pull it off but you really dont have to. The rest i'm sure you can figure out for yourself.
