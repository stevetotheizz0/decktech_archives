Strategy: 

Update:
Doesnt drain well my dam a$$.  Two in space, Tthree per one icon site, 3 for tat occ.  14 per turn biatch.  And unless your dumb, this OWNS space.  you don?t just deploy your one thing at a time, you wait till your ready.  And you get 11 force on your own, which is plenty for this.  every LS deck gives you at least 3.  And drain sites.


This is pretty basic.  Plays like a LS throne room mains, but has some damn good damage potential.  Dominates everywhere.

I might write a better strat section sometime, but this is an older deck, i haven?t played it for like 2 months, so I don?t want to screw it up :)
