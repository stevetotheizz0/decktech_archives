Ralltiir Ops 

Strategy: 

Slap your Imps in the Cloud Cars and flip the objective. Cloud Cars are better than speeder bikes and cheaper than AT-STs, compromising only 1 power. Not bad. FLip the objective, start pulling Clouds and setting up drains up in Clouds. I have a new anti-Falcon strategy.  I think I stole it from Lt. Treidum, but I cant remember, but none-the-less I	copied it over.  Use Captain Khurgee to scanning Crew Capn Han and Leia away.  I like this strategy a lot more than the old one.  I added a Ghhhk and a Masterful Move to the deck.  Use the MM to get the Ghhhk early in the game if you can.

The main strategy is to drain like hell on Ralltiir.  The way to beat Jedi Training is to land all of your mains on Dagobah and build up a big army vs. Yoda and whoever and just start draining at all the 1/0 sites.	It will eat them up.  I havent lost to a Jedi Training deck yet when I used this strategy.  The other culprit is Ops, which I havent seen anything of lately, so I ditched Imp Decree and ABCenter.  If they are popular in your area, you may want to add them.

BTW, Mosep kicks ass, many games you'll have a drain of 6 from the top of the reserve.

At this point I will ask that you re-look at the cards and my strategy as I dont need anymore idiot reviews.
