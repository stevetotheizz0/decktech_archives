Strategy: '

-First off this is my first deck posted here.  I was recommened as a Deck Master here at Decktech thanks to TJ Holman(and others?).	Here we go.

-You start Obi's Hut but from there it depends.

Against Charbon Chamber Deck w/ Scanning Crews you start Scrambled Transmission and use it to get Shocks as well as looking for your locations in reserve deck.

Against Hunt Down you start Goo-Nee Tay.  Then all you have to do is cancel Visage, deploy Boushh w/ Uncontrollable Fury on Vader and win.

Against any other deck use careful planning to get Jabba's Palace for quick force just.

This deck is teched to the bone. There are a couple ways to win with this deck.  If they aren't activating must put Monk w/EPP at Jabba's Palace.  Then plop down Civil Disorder and watch them loose.  What's funny is the use of Frozen Assets.  Basically you can play it up to 4 times(Effective Repairs).  Do that and they'll loose really fast.  Against a deck activating a lot wait for them to do something and beat them up.  USE BACTA TANK to it's full advantage... I can't stress that enough  Also at the beginning of any game Signal for Traffic control and get out all your 2/0 locations.  Once you comprehend this deck it's almost unstopable.	'
