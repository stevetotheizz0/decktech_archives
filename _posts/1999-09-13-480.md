Strategy: '

It's back. I've just been messing with this deck
on the side here and there to see how it's been.
Here comes strategy again 

v. HDADTJ  start Goo Nee Tay. Duel defense comes
in the form of Courage of a Skywalker , Glancing
Blow , AND Swing and a Miss. Bothans cancel Visage
while It's A Hit stops Elises if Senses are weak.

v. Ops  Harc Seff and Order to Engage are the new
additions in this deck to revamp it into having a
better chance v. Ops if the one turn kill opportunity
never pops up. Sorry About the Mess keeps ISB's 5d6
off for a turn. Battle Plan should also get a nice
load of work here.

v. Drazin Manip / CCT Testing  heh. They are sure
gonna have a tough day. Scrambled Transmission
start will have them is a bit of trouble. Wedge gets
to get toted around for awhile. The 2 Shocking
Infos will put the sting on Scanning Crew and the
It's A Hits will also stop the SCrew. Grimtaash is
nice if Drazin ever retrieves anything. Bothans
will help you say hello to Drazin though.

v. Big Blue  Mantellian Savrip and the Smoke Screen
will earn their due here. SAC can probably give a
decent edge and tracking SInfos is advised.

v. TIEs  drain when you can otherwise just
load up Falcon and smack them if they spread out
too far. Also you can drive them crazy with Order
to Engage with a loaded Falcon backed by Savrip )

Miscellaneous notes  If your scared of ATWYStomach
then don't drain at Toschi Station. Destiny in the
deck is pretty nice also and just try to have fun
while actually having a bunch of interaction. Frozen
Assets can be critical in a game and that'll usually
be the decision where it makes in breaks the game
so choose carefully. Savrip will make up for the
small amount of characters.Draw Their Fire can
retrieve a tremendous amount of cards and SAC
should keep most things off your back. Don't Forget
The Droids will stop #s and you'll be absolutely
amazed at how many times you have the chance to
play It's A Hit ;)
