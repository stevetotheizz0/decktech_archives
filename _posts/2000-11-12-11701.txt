Strategy: '

sorry for posting it twice.dont now how it happened.


First turn pull before activating pull carida.Then get a <> docking bay and deploy it at carida.Continue to pull out the docking bays so you can get lots of force.Flip the objective and start draining for tons Usually it will go up to around 8 or 9.If they come to battle you just lose a outer rim scout and retreive it.Use the tramples to kill there guys.Get Den of theives out to cancel there drains.Late in the game retreive using Abysin Ornament.If he deploys blount go destroy him.
