Strategy: 

	in this deck I try to set up early and just 
out flow jawa’s(deploy 0 when tessek at audience 
chamber and power 3 when kalits there and up to 
forfeit 8) and palace raiders from my hand. 
I usually surprise my opponent with the power
 of the jawas in early battles which usualy hearts
 thier forces. if they don’t attack i set up massive
drains.(i can drain for 6 at jundland wastes while
tessek at chamber, crell on table and vaperator
and hydro station there). I use OTE to chase my 
opponent out of the audience chamber and for 
general purposes. in some battles i can have 4 BD’s
and 1 to power therefore handing out loads of 
attrition and chasing my opponent. this deck has a
good 5-1 record at tournaments and always beats my 
friends. I don’t use sandwhirl because it would 
cause trouble for my non jawa’s and i choose to have
more useful sites. when i am playiny I stick to 
the same plan of drainig and cancelling my 
opponents unless there is a cause for me to raid 
them.
	plese give me an idea for another starting 
interrupt and plese review
	THANKS FOR READING 
beware of the jawa’s
