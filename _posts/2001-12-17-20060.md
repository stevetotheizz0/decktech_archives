Strategy: '

Well, since Im a homeschool, please pardon all typos and grammer errors.  Thank you.  


*Update*

I have taken out one Visage of the Emperor and put in a extra tatooine ocupation.  Due to the fact that Endor Celebration is starting to be a hot card again.

I have also taken out Evader/Monnok for Broken Concentration because I forgot it is a super cool card and works wonders in this deck. 

Another thing Imperial Arrest order/secret plans is your third effect. 

Thank you.

*End update*


*Anwsering questions*

i dont get why you want to pull rendili over the executor, why play rendili at all?? 

 	MoTU

Well MoTU, I pull it because MOB points is suspended unless I occupy a battle ground system.  Now I dont want that to happen so I pull a battle ground system. Got it? And also against QMC decks and a lot of other decks they set up Battle plan earily.  Plus then the light side player will know I have the executor in my  hand and they will just lose the two and put it back in to my deck and the abilty of pulling it would be worthless.


Aurras rifle is tech. but Hidden Base Flip w/ Mains will always rape watto deck.apart from that ,nice 

zwitter


Well, true about Hidden flip.  Hidden flip is the smallest thing in my area right next to MBO -) Anyways though, I use the ships for fast probes and tatooine Maul in his ship for many probes, seeing how you have abilty of zero without a character of abilty >3 at the same place and then I can also  lose 2 to make it so you cannot battle me, to tell the truth, Maul in his ship is the back bone of this deck.


If you have any other questions about thte deck I would be happy to anwser them, e-mail me at Crewman Wilson@cs.com or just mail me on deck tech.


*End Q& A*

Wattos a homeschooler is very easy to play and beats most decks.  During the game pull out the sheilds that fit (such as, you might want to pull Youve never won a race? if light side is podracing, is I think is going to make a come back.) During your games though, the sheilds you are more than likely going to play are Resistance, Allegations of corruption and Battle Order. I have gotten rulings from 3 different Decipher members that I (as the dark side player) get the first action to pull a system with Mob points.  So pull out Rendili and set up the Wattos homeschool program on Tatooine. You have Executor but you are more than likely want to save that for Tatooine to hold it for Tatooine Occupation. So play Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and Bossk and if you really want to, play Tatooine Maul and Mauls ship.  Tatooine Maul is now the most powerful thing in space against Han, Chewie and the Falcon, Dash in his ship, Ric Olie, he makes them all ability of zip. Grab a I have you now and you will cycle it.  Play Datcha (yes my educated friend, dust off that Datcha) and make them use the two force they were saving for Watto. By end game set up the occupation and by then you will make them lose 8 to 10 force (depends on if they pay for Watto.  


Cards you think should not be in here

Dagobah Cave New Yoda tech


Colonel David Jon Power 5, draws destiny is not able to otherwise, and is Immune to attrition <3.  Sounds good to me, helps with a first turn flip. I do not use


Aurra Sings blaster Destiny 7 and cancels Qui-gons Immunity to atrition.


Datcha I make them use two force that they saved and I make the lose two and I cycle a high destiny back into the deck and hes power plus two on a non-tatooine site (ummm....Naboo? Naboo is a non-Tatooine site right?)


Vaders Obsession and The Circle is now complete The circle is now complete will get rid of Obi-wan for the rest of the game for one force, simple? Yes.  Vaders Obesstion works great on a very late game finisher, you can track like a mad man and they will never expect it coming. Trust me.


The Phantom Menace x2 Their destiny 7 and you can pull them with Masterful move AND you can cycle them back in AND make Darth Maul with Lightsaber Immune to Attrition. 


Visage of the Emperor Cycle it then track it.


No Emperors? Why thats a simple question I dont own any




Decks that it is going to go up against


Watch you step  Use A Useless Gesture and Hold the Cantina, get Maul into space and hold Tatooine for the Occupation. it will be tough but if you play it right you will out drain/damage your oppenent.


QMC You want to pull Executor insted of rendilli.  Get Executor at Bespin (with the objective) so that way all your characters will be deploy -1. All and all, you should win, but it will be very tough I will admit. 


Lightsaber combat I hate this deck (if you want to see how much, then just read my tournament reports).  Battle order is the best and it stalls out for a win.  Tough game.


Mains Simple as PYE (thats like 3.something something right?).  If they do the hidden base set up then throw down Mara Jade at the Home one Docking bay followed by some other stuff and beat them down. I dunno, just win this game Im a homeschooler


Hidden base flip Get all your fleet to Tatooine and drain and Occupation the hell out of them. Ditch the YCHF/MP for search and destroy.  you will make them lose 6-8 force a turn (depends on if they use the force).


We have a plan I havnt play against this deck yet.  But I suggest holding the throne room at all costs, that way they cant deploy cards with Ability at naboo sites. Imperial arrest order will stop Nabrun Ledis.


If you have any questions please ask them


Oh I almost forgot why Watto is a homeschooler While Watto is at the Junkyard he makes the light side characters forget what they are doing due to the fact that Watto cannot read what his game text says I can fly? Land speed of how much? Sorry guys, Im a homeschooler, I cant read.
