Strategy: '

I was suppose to use this deck at my Province/State Champ. but I was not able to go there so i think that i should put in here if someone need a really descent deck right now. This deck is, IMO, the best LS out there, it can stand anything, to ROPS to Occupations and even ISB. No really strategy as you saw already this kind of deck uynless I've add things like X-wing cannon against those SO popular BH ships, add more Shocking against the SOOO popular and powewrfull CC sabacc manipulator (btw start wize advice against that.) otherwize start battle plan.

Boussh can drain on Ralthirr (ROPS) and on operative planets. Ultimatum is better against numbers than Don't forget the droid cause it can't be 'Voyeured' or grab

Well I think that's it for now...If i found something else I'll add it

Good luck '
