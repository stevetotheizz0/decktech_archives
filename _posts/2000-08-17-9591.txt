Strategy: 

First I'll arm the death star with a superlaser. then all get as many sites out as I can. Then I'll put a leader in the conference room, and I'll deploy all my gunners to make sure I blow up Alderaan. I'll also deploy other characters as they come through my hand to help defend the death star sites. I'll deploy my patrol droid, im4-099, and battle against force drains. After I blow up alderaan I'll flip my objective and start deploying battle ground systems. Then I'll deploy all my star desroyers and my starships. If unpiloted I will add r4-m9 to pilot the ship.Then I will force drain my opponent to death, but just before they'er dead I'll make an attempt to blow up yavin 4 (just for fun).
