Strategy: '

First turn Pull out a system( ot two using MOF)and get someone there for a drain. Chances are that they will not ambush you second turn. Only initiate the podrace when you have thec lost the force to retrive, and flip as soon as possible. When you get a hyper escape hang onto it as you can spread out as cnces are thast the opponent will only initiate one space battle a turn. You should get a nice drain of ten+ when spread out with a hyper escape in hand.
  You should win the podrace with enough high destinies as 5 severns and a wad of fives and podrace prep to guratee a severn.
   This normally does pretty well(except agains Vader 69’s smoke ganja at the throne room deck) So here are some stragys to hlp against different decks
 Set Course For AlderaanBe very wary as they have a truck load of space and would be willing to beat you down. 
 An all ground deck If you scan their deck somehow(no DB)then you will find that they have no space and you can spread out and deploy the minimum of starships and make your retrval to laugh in  his face (Sorry)PROPS
  ISBA drain race, be wary as they may have space and cancel their high force drains with boush and the flipped objectve.
  Oh and I have spaced it out properly as a lot of people were giving me stick for that and did not rate my last deck as much as it should have got(jpvz) 
  Any way thanks
