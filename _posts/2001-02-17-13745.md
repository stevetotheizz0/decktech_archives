Strategy: '

 I have been playing this deck for months and i love it mainly cause its so consitent. Second turn i always activate at laest 10 force. This lets me start laying the beatdown first turn wich can be realy unexpected. First turn before you activate pull Crix Madine and General Solo. Then search for home one docking bay Dagobah and yodas hut after you activate. Deploy Madine to home One docking bay and serch for chewie of kashyyk. Now you have a combo thats kinda like vader tarkin cause they can use 2 force to cancel a destiny. From here all you have to do is deploy and battle.

When they annitiate against you play fallen portal and take out key characters. If they are playing space dont deploy general han on the ground cause your gonna need the falcon. Get the falcon with EPP han and EPP leia with the outrider with dash rendar and another pilot and you have a almost unbeatable combo if your tracking. 


Characters


Ben Kenobi= Hunt Down and Scum are by far the most popualar decktypes in my area. Not playing him would be silly cause he has built in dueling protection. And he greatly helps my strategy against court.


EPP Obi= For those times that i need to have fast power at sites other then tatooine.


Jedi Luke= Your stupid if you dont now why


General Solo= A han that i get to search for plus canceling destinys is always a good thing.


Chewie Of Kashyyk= I get to serch for him plus he finishes of the han combo


EPP han= Good for making Super falcon or as backup on ground


EPP leia= Good on ground and on falcon with han.


Crix Madine= Lets me search for scouts like chewie.


Blount= Spy that Madine can search for.


Tawss Khaa= Good all around character. Power 3 ability 4 for a deploy of 3 is pretty good. Plus i can retreive stuff for winning battles.


Corran Horn= Awsome aganist undercover spys and against scum decks its like having a extra jedi when hes power 5.


Out of commision= somtimes its better not to pay one to play this card. Plus i only have 2 of the combos


Fallen portal= Almost all the battles will take place on docking bays and this card is a monster when you have that tracked 6.


Smoke Screen= Good card for the beggining of the game when your not tracing and you need a hing destiny.


On The Edge= All around good card you can retreive a couple of cards with. Also if they drop down a ton of stuff against your lone character you can play this and kill him.


Clash of sabers= This could be a game ending card if they dont have crush out.


I will add some matchups tommorow.
