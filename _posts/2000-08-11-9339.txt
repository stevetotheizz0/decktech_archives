Strategy: 

Notes :
Just more simple stuff - Ability Ability and more Ability.
Normal start is You Cannot Hide Forever and IAO. If
they appear to be playing space then you can get
Oppressive Enforcement or Something Special
Planned for them. Obviously if it is against Ops you
use the Op Killer , Leave Them To Me.

Between the Grapplers , Secret Plans , and
SSP4Them you shouldn't have any problems slowing
or stopping retrieval. With the 27 ability cards you
should have no problem getting a battle destiny.The
destiny should be fine most of them are 3s and
OpEnforcement helps the big SDs.

Rebel Barrier isn't a problem because they have so
much to choose from to barrier , just make sure to put
out your decent stuff first and your strongest stuff last
( it'll be hard to resist Barriering another super forfeit
pilot after you have like +20 power at the system ,
then you drop Dengar :).

This deck is a space machine , the Admiral's Order
lets you get solid immunity to attrition with your Caps
and combined with IAO you are usually spitting out
deploy 1 forfeit 6 Pilots which is huge. Dengar helps
the destiny as do the recyclers. If they convert your
Admiral's Orders you now have a trackable 6 and
Imperial Arrest Order will suck up the attrition.

Imperial Barrier and Gravity Shadow are a few of the
tricks. Remember that SSP4Them makes each ship
move away for +2 Force. If they have 4 ships there then
they are paying 12 to move away ! Nemet and 181-3
stop 'reacts'.

This deck isn't really slow because Merrejk gets out
systems at the DS:War Room and everything just seems
to come together quickly.

This isn't the greatest deck in the world but it is very
fun to mess around with , enjoy.
