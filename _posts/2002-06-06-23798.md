Strategy: '

Here is a better lightsaber combat for you all.  I like to write drawn out reports but this is combat, so you should know how it works.  Instead I will explain a few cards that you think is STUPID and tell you why I have choosen them.  Gracias for your time.


another pathetic lifeform- activating force is nice, expecially when you need it fast or need it for the ds draw their fire


the new virtual saber puller- cause obi and qui gon are happier with their sticks


scrambled transmission- so good.  Keeps hand manipulation nice and plus you can drop and draw the combo card with threepio. As soooo many put it TECH


Kessel- put your falcon in space against dsc and drain for three.  HAHAHAHA TECH BABY


obi-wan, jedi knight- because this is combat, not hit and run


luke with lightsaber- because this still needs to be a little hit and run HAAHAHAA


yoda, master of the force- after seeing AOTC, why shouldnt you play with him  BONG


baragwin x2- cause they rock at retrieval and are funny.  BARAGWIN WINS THE GAME


Old school falcon + Capt Han + EPP Leia + Super Lando and Chewie = super duper falcon.  I have pulled this off a few times and it is funny.  That is a lot of force, but once obi and qui gon are down you dont have much to do.  This coupled with sense is the game for most deck.  People dont see this coming from combat which makes it so nice.  I mean you get around Zuckuss, get four destiny, add 12 to your total and you get to retrieve and add to power if defending.  Beat that Han Chewie Falcon.  This totally rapes scrubs (like me) and can do well against more seasoned players also.  Just save up some force and drop it like its hot.


thrown back- helps differential, plus you can drop 7s during their turn  HAHAHAHAHA


bacta tank- to make sure the falcon stays alive HAHAHAHAHA


fall of the legend + throw me another charge- these are strickly my choice.  I suggest you find something else.  Ever since hidden mains I have loved these cards.  Nice trackable sixes that they wont grab cause everything else is too important.



Well, get set up on the ground then go to space.  I cant think of any ds deck that doesnt play at least one system in case of lsc.  Have fun, and yall come back now ya hear
