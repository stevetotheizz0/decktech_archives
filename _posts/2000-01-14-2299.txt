Court Of The Vile Gangster / I Shall Enjoy Watching You Die (2) '

Strategy: '

Dream Start first turn deploy Pote & 2 Skrillings + Insert.

Now there is some space power for DS aliens. Deploy a starship from reserve deck, that should keep them of Tatooine System and keep your Occupation going.

This deck is not perfect (low ability, ops,recurring mains), but it's got retrieval, ground power, space power, demi-VotE, occupation AND inserts.

Maybe it needs some more anti-Undercover to keep LS losing force from Objective. Or maybe it should test it more )
