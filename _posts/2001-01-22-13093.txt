Strategy: '

i know i onlt have 2 ships.but it works fine    since al the  guys go on them  & you draw an etra   put r2-d2 on outrider & dash too   then substract some guy;s power by 8....it move fast ebcause you look in youre deck every turn & see what cards you want if any...then pick up only for those(if any)

a inice combo is get shocking out of deck & play used grimtash if he has 13 or more..or go for doubles if you think it’s good.whatever but only one use it wiselly

also with the blaster pro you add 3......with the orders you fire during control............easy to see a conection there no?	;]

well it moves fast but youll have to make it move fast.& know how...with the looking & with getign the 2 ships out fast & then the celebration.......then you start kicking in...but it wont win worlds	mostly for a local tourney....made for fun...but still like i sai strong
i still used ben cause.......well ben on tat.need you say more?? deploy + 6 but who gives? '
