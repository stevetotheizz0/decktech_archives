***UPDATE*** thanks everybody for the constructive feedback...low reviews suck, but low reviews with wise advise are better than mindless fives.  anyways, the consensus seems to be that Corporal Midge NEEDS to be in all RST deck...fair enough.  REMOVE colonel cracken, REPLACE WITH corporal midge.  ...perhaps i’ll drop a  barrier for another explosive charge...thanks again everybody

************************************************************

this is the boom-race deck i build based on the design played by Scott Lingrell at RCon.  Mad props to him for coming up with the best version of a boom-race deck.  HOWEVER, i have altered the deck template he played to suit my own playstyle and to match the meta of my area.  lemme explain some of the differences

The Signal x3, We Wish To Board At Once x3, The Shield Is Down ***instead of*** The Shield Is Down x5, The Signal x2  Lingrell played 5 TSID because he preferred force conservation (not having to pay the three to fetch the effect)...I don’t mind paying the three.  DS has been force screwed ever sense they hosed Mobilization Points, so most games the DS player will provide you with AT LEAST two force...PLUS you are less vulnerable to monnok...and the effect grabbers also fetch Thrown Back for even more protection

epp han ***instead of*** General Solo  IMHO, General Solo is not that good.  by contrast, epp han is THE MAN  you can pull chewie with crix, drop han to the party and have two destiny.  PLUS you don’t waste both of your Strike Planning general ’yanks’.  oftentimes what will happen is that gen crix will get killed, retrieved when you win the podrace, then downloaded a SECOND TIME via strike planning so he can come back and kick some more ass...this is loads of fun

why so few explosive charges?  
because one charge is enough.  this deck is eazy peezy to track...with Drop and all the high destiny used interrupts, you really should have no problem blowing the bunker.  if the DS commits CrAzY heavy mains to the bunker...worst case senario is they get to hold a site that you have no icons at and they’ll need modifiers to drain you there.  but oftentimes epps + jedi resilience + insane destiny = mad beatdowns.

wassup with all of the OOC’s???
they rock the house.  this was the most innovative part of Lingrell’s original deck and it’s gravy.  if the people in your area are already wise enough to grab this the first time you use it, perhaps think about taking all but the combo OOC’s out and putting something else fun and annoying in it’s place.  if the ppl in your parts donno whazzup with this deck, then it can be quite frightning.  the OOC’s can demolish your opponent’s plan by placing crucial characters OOP early (or en masse when you win the pod race).  

why podracing?
lots of direct damage and retrieval is lots of fun  if dark side pod racing is popular in your area, maybe drop some OOC’s for some podracing tech...or maybe drop the whole podracing bit and play the close air support / tala twin version of RST (the DONE RIGHT version looks mighty solid).

GAME PLAY

1) grab all your stuff ASAP  
2) coyly place cards out of play when possible
3) win the podrace (don’t forget to save force to retrieve)
4) either protect your own sites or attack your opponent (like i said before, resilience + epps)
5) mid to late game set up a strike team to blow the bunker

this deck is wacky fun and a bit different from the everyday lightsabre combat.  

PLEASE PROVIDE HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS SO THAT I MIGHT IMPROVE FUTURE ITERATIONS OF THIS DECK
