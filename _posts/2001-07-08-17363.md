**************Changes******************

I added more characters which can deploy to help get out DD- most of them can all draw destiny by themselves, so it is safe to deploy them early.  I added a  few more Twi’lek Advisors to help get out efects if needed.  I believe the average destiny has gone up a bit- because many people sadi the average  was too low to win the race.  Now it should be better.

***********End of Changes**************



With the release of Tatooine, this deck has been made possible again. I&#8217;m Sorry completely makes this deck a beast. Podracing just by itself is amazing and can change a game. So I thought that if there was a way to combine the two, you could get a great deck. This is what I came up with. 


Start is basic for a podracing deck, however I start I&#8217;m Sorry rather than Watto&#8217;s Box for a few reasons. If the DS doesn&#8217;t have the Box the LS may think they are not a real serious threat in podracing, and because it is necessary for this deck to function. 


First turn grab CC if you can, and feel free to deploy it. However I usually will not depoly the other two sites (I will still take them into my hand though) until I will be able to get Dark Deal out and running. This is mainly for defense, so that my oponent cannot start building up massive fleets on CC. 


I do not play with the Bespin sytems for a few reasons. Without sacrificing my ground forces my space fleet cannot match up with the possible LS capital ships. In the clouds I can easily hold my own. While CC Occupation is good, it isn&#8217;t need to win. Rather than risk losing control of the system and getting a huge space beatdown, I prefer not to play with the system. 


All the charcters are self-explanatory. I have 3 Dark Jedi, so IHYK is very big, even more so because of CTR. Aurra is great because she draws destiny by herself and can get lightsabers. Igar adds one destiny on Tempest 1, which can deploy to the Casino. Blizard is also for support there. However both can go to any other system if the LS is getting annoying. 


You Are Beaten is possibly one of the biggest and best DS cards around in my opinion. Especialy against WYS decks and others. Being able to exclude characters is just huge. Especially agaisnt a WYS deck if you in theory just took away two destiny from the LS and giving them a huge beatdown. Kiss is big in case you accidentally left yourself open for a beatdown. It is in here for pure defense. However an early pop from DITF can help too. CTR is great in this deck because it stops destiny adder decks from completely wrecking you. S & D hurts HB decks that don&#8217;t like the ground. 


My ships are good in the clouds- even though the BH ships may not have a lot of power, they still have their abilities which are incredible. 


The deck is pretty easy to play, the key is to play your game and force the LS to come to you. If you have any questions, let me know before you rate the deck. As always any comments and suggestion are appreciated. Thanks
