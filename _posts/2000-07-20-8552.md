Strategy: '

Well, it's pretty much your basic EBO start.  After finding Squadron Assignments, and the new Admiral's Orders, I figured going with pilots and their matching ship would be better than the regular X-Wings.  I'm not 100% sure about all of the rules concerning the new Admiral's Orders, so I'm not sure if it is legal to put down a second I'll Take The Leader after the first one has left the table.  But anyway, I usually get EBO set up by turn 2 or 3.  Then I just go up and drain in space while getting the Rebel Fleet out with Squadron Assignments.  If I have the ship with the matching pilot out, everything is at least immune to attrition <4 (<6 with "I'll Take The Leader" on the table).  If you're not sure why some guys are in here, Colonel Salm keeps Imperial Control flipped while he is at the renegade system, while Kin Kian adds 1 to force drains while aboard a unique Gray Squadron Y-Wing.  Elyhek Rue adds one to force drains at Ralltiir if opponent is play ROps, and Hol Okand adds 1 to force drains while at Kashyyk.  Lajaie lets me react to Hoth while he is at a Hoth site.  Luke with his saber and Obi-Wan with his saber are in there to help deal with Menace Fades or Battle Plan if I need it.	Insurrection lets me throw out the Endor Landing Platform so they have somewhere to go.  The other Signals are in there for pulling the effects that I need.  Strike Force is going to help out a ton, as my force drains won't be able to be modified unless they come up to space and win a battle.  And finally, I only have one Transmission Terminated in the deck because Hunt Down is not popular around here (or at least the people I have come across).  So I know that in some areas, you may need to add one or two more.  Well, that's pretty much it.	If anybody has any questions, feel free to contact me.	Thanks to everyone who takes the time to review this for me.'
