Strategy: '

ok, lets begin the beatings.
First off, everything in this deck deploys for dirt, that helps.  your objective is a very cool thing.	at first you pop out troopers, they pop out bikes, you flip no later than 3rd turn.  The flip side lets you pull out any card, your battle destiny is plus 3 and sure, your opponents force drains are all minus one.

That was the simple stuff, now for the hate.  You sit there on your little planet, doing your massive drain of 3, while you pop out your planet, which helps for battle order and odds. ok, now you have 15 going for numbers, while ability and drains are going on.

Bubo takes care of a lot of stuff, anything weak dies

High speed tactics, hehe, good card.  2 things, tallen roll on the ground and destiny adder, what more could you want

Vader, he is good for hit and runs and circle, the good doctor is emotional support if needed

effects, you have all you ever wanted,
biker scout gear- pure tech
security precautions- u know what that does
bad feeling - sure, rebel or no, they won't come down that quick if Obi is deploy 9
everything else is self explanatory

I always start with Bad Feeling, other options would be Crush if they start Throne Room, or There is no Try if you think they are doing S.A.C.
Boring conversation, cancels a lot, lets just say, Gift, Skywalkers, Don't get @#$%y, SURPISE ASSAULT

sergeant elsek - permament ghhhk, enough said
The ships are cool and get the job done

This deck has never had a problem with generating force or needing force, I have won a game activating no more than 4 Force the entire game
Overall this deck is very versitle and can cover just about anything.  P.S. just watch out for Revo,  '
