Strategy: 

Your looking at this deck and thinking what a piece of crap, well it may not look like much but it’s got it where it counts...In the Destiny. You’ll notice that most of the locations are exterior for my Walker (yes only one) and my Skiffs (for the Mercs.) the two interior sites are were Janus and the Emperor sit. (Usually in the Incinerator - that way if I loose 4-LOM or IGGY I can retrieve them) and the Walker is ofcourse for Lando and Lobot, of which where Vader w/stick and Tarkin sit.
Most of the other sites are set up for this or that to get people to where I want them.

First things first - get the Executor

The activation in this deck is key, when you look for your stuff first get the Dark Deal, then The sites, then Cloud City Occ. after which you start your set up in one swift turn, this is where most people make the mistake and start out setting up slower than normal and don’t get enough going for them and thus loose the game. Well when you plop it all down at one time you get a better advantage...Not to mention better potential for beat downs... (of course there are exceptions...getting out the Emp. and Janus first turn are key to anywhere - gotta love that Force Lightning/Emperor/Janus tech)

Once you start your set up get your Mercs. to the Clouds and on the Skiffs and get the attrition of 3 @ all the exterior sites where you have a Merc on a Skiff and another for the one in the clouds..... Mmmmm good stuff.

Other than that just set up and Force Drain....Of course MWYHL/SYIC can hurt but if you flip quickly it shouldn’t be that much of a problem.

Against TIGIH - just wait for him to come to you. He’ll have a field day w/his stupid Eloms but you can beat them out w/the destinys in the deck.

Against Mains and Toys just hold yourself steady and set up the beat down as stated...and finally

against Super Falcon - can you say Dengar In Punishing One - who cares if you draw 3 destiny - I’m gonna kill everyone there cause I can draw 3 as well (of course you need Zuckuss In Mist Hunter, 4-LOM (which you can retrieve w/Incinerator) and Bossk In Hounds Tooth.

Other than that this is a great deck to play and I enjoy playing.

Thanks for reading,
