LOCATIONS

jabas palace: lower passage
audiance chamber 

Strategy: 

	    Start by pulling the audiance chamber and mighty jabba from the deck using the audiance chamber game text, next turn pull the lower passage and fortify the audiance chamber or flip if possible, also pull bib from the deck. once flipped your opponent wont dare fight you when all your battle destinies are +2 and all thier rebels are deploy +2
	 set scum up and start the retrieval, whether you battle for real or play projective telepathy. If the game turns in to a drain race you should beable to beat it with gailid and all your drain 2 locations.
	You should beable to beat all ground decks, the hardest is probably i can save him, though you should be okay with 4-lom to take out that pesky lukes immunity to attrition.
	Against HB get security percautions out and hoard your ships until they flip and you can probe, if they dont flip out drain them and take out thier mains.
	 against EBO Raid hoth and try to cancel EBO, you should also have enough drain cancelers.
	 this deck is solid. a lot of people think 4 myos is to much, but it really isnt. you will cancel drains and battle destinies with him, and if hes lost you replace him and the other regenerates.
	 Play smart and you should win alot with it.
