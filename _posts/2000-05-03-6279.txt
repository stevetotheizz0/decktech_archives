-Short Stratagy

OK... This is how you start it
Deploy your starting stuff, BFHI to slow down opponents mains, and draw your hand.  You want to get Mara and her saber out as quick as you can.  So 1st turn use the obj to pull your docking Bay while checking for Mara and Saber.  If you find them deploy em if you have 6 force.  If not you are probably safe to deploy just her, but alway check how much force the opponent's activating.  Once you get Mara out she can be used to drain for 2 and for your SA.  Make sure to get her a back up crew ASAP.  She is key to a strong early start.

The BHs with their forfit + 2 are now powerful and don't all die all at once.	Bubo's in there cause he's VERY useful.  Take him to the opponents ground and start the feeding frenzy.  Or just keep him at home for his cool ability to prevent movement.  No S&V?  no thanks, I prefer Vader, Tarkin and especially the Walkers.

This deck is the first deck I have made that is fairly balanced.  It should play good against most stuff I've seen.  You just need to calculate your moves and know when to drain, battle, and be sure to play your interrupts right. '
