Hey darkjedi2000 what are you smokin’??? I’m not starting with Honor.


END OF UPDATE


Strategy

You use Strike Planning to pull out General Crix Madine and General Solo during your opponents 1st turn so you make sure they are in there. Then deploy Crix to the landing Platform on your first turn. Use him to pull a scout (like COK or Midge) and deploy him with crix. Then move luke over. Do this so on your second turn you get a force drain of two and you activate at least 7 from yourself alone. Continue to pull scouts with Madine. Once you pull COK from reserve deck, pull Wuta and with wuta pull sites. Eventually you will only have high destinies left in your deck (becuase most of your characters are pulled and all of your endor sites are pulled. Use Midge to enhance your force drains and the destiny adders to win battles.


Against Hunt down-  First turn pull Blount from your reserve deck and go cancel visage.


Against ISB- Start with your normal stuff. Blount should win you this game.


Against BHBM- A tough match-up. If you build this deck, maybe take out a couple of cards for Anikan Skywalker and NOOOOOO. If not, try to battle a lot. Turn Vader before he turns you.


Against ties- Set up a super falcon with chewie and han with gun or leia and han. You should have enough drains to out drain him.


Those are the only decks at the last few touneys. If you have any questions just drop me a line. Please review this with any suggestions and keep in mind that this is my first time posting something so try to go easy.
