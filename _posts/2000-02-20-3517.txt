Strategy: 

This deck probably doesn't require a master to use, but you need to have a good idea of what you're doing. Start with Wakeelmui, Twi'lek Advisor, and Seinar Fleet Systems. This provides poor force activation, so you may need to draw up the first few turns to get locations. Use Fears as you get them, but hold your TIE's until you get a Big One and/or a system to drain at. Use the Twi'lek Advisors to get out you're effects. This deck is very prone to an early Grimtaash, so try not to over draw. You can slow down their drains by getting out Imperial Decree and Hoth or Yavin 4 with a cloud sector on it, letting you drain for as much if not more. Later in the game, set up a Big One an deploy 2 TIE Scouts to it. Since they have a terrible manuever of only 1, they will get blown away no problem. Use SFS to send 1 to your used pile, and put the other on Return To Base. Next turn you will have 2 more TIE's to deploy and retreive off of. When You are canceling one drain per turn and reteiving every time you deploy a TIE, you should not have a problem outlasting your opponent. As always, watch out for a Tantive 4 or Tydirium ambush.
