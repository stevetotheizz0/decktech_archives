Strategy: '

Start with the Throne room swamp and farm. You go first and activate at least 5 force. This gives you just enough to put down a nudj andpull off a signel. Search for something like Goo Nee Tay or Mantillian Savrip. The battle groungs shold provide you with the extra boost in the drane race. If your opponent is draining you don't be afraid to go to his locations. This deck is ment for battle You might want to throw in some sense/alters and that isnt a bad idea at all. Also Honor Of a Jedi is an option. Have Fun with this one.'
