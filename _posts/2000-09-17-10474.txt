Strategy: 

Okay, everyone knows MWYHL. This IS a testing deck. And I&#8217;ve played with it a few times times. Its completed all 6 tests twice (and it took forever to get out DoS, Yoda and Test 1) and lost once, when I didn&#8217;t get any characters til the 6 or 7th turn, and was having my @#$% drained off in space.

Basically, use the objective to pull Yoda, Yoda&#8217;s Hope, Luke&#8217;s Backpack, and DoS from the deck. Pull Training Area first turn (using Dagobah
&#8217;s GT) and use it to get out your tests. Then pull Yoda&#8217;s Hut, then Swamp, then Jungle. (I didn&#8217;t bother to put Bog Clearing in, because with Yoda, Luke&#8217;s Sac, Wise Advice and Yoda&#8217;s hope, +5 for DoS, +4 for sites...... you only need 2s to pull off the tests).

The biggest @#$% about Testing has always been Jedi Test 3. With The Way of Things, that is automatically completed. Not only that, but now your DoS (or SoS, if you decided to train him, but DoS is better in this situation) is Lanspeed = 2. So that stupid Jedi Test 2 can&#8217;t really evade you. Also, it helps to get Yoda to his hut before you pull DoS of that swampy sack of @#$%.

Leave Tests 5 & 6 in the deck &#8217;til you REALLY need &#8217;em, so you can keep a good 5 & 6 destiny. Test 6 is really fun. A nice solution to those gay-@#$% Jabba&#8217;s Court decks, who don&#8217;t have Vader&#8217;s, so they start losing 2 a turn. Also you can get DoS off and deploy her at Vader&#8217;s site in the same turn. With your 7 that you&#8217;ve hopefully tracked and packed for Jedi Test 5, and the 10 force you just retreived in time to duel Vader and get an extra destiny. Next turn, battle the hell out of &#8217;em. Two destiny 7s, and those sticks are now auto-hit. Not to mention you can reduce their destiny by 1 (any destiny) and reduce the attrition by 2, its a real saver for those EPPs.

Also, right after you complete Jedi Test 4, if you KNOW that Electrobinoculars (if they aren&#8217;t already out) are in your Used Pile, drop the Yoda&#8217;s Hope to find Levitation. Then use the Lost text and get the Electrobinoculars out and start tracking that 7.

This is all the Testing strategy there is. Its fairly simple, and I think it just happens to be how FAST you pull it off. Not IF you pull it off.

Visage, Court and all those other pesky cards that make you lose 1 a turn, are now worthless if you get out that Honor of the Jedi.

Use Insurrection to pull out those Docking Bays. Cloud City first, because that is the site SoS will be deploying to. Then Tatooine, so Ben can deploy. Then the Endor one, so GenSolo and Bacca of K can deploy cheap. Then mix &#8217;em up. Use DB tranisit. Those are all the docking bays you really need.

Air is pretty simple. A big bad blue deck might be good offense against this one. But once you get Test 1 complete all those Force Drain bonuses are cancelled.

The rest of the deck is self-explanatory. Its mainly a Battle deck, not really big on Force Draining.

Have fun. And check my Profile for information on my new STAR WARS website.
