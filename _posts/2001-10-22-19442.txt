Strategy: 

update for vs r3

***ok here you go. first most defensive sheild won’t hurt you.  vs the new dueling deck try for a first turn vader or maul at the 2/3 site.  if you can get the fast flip this is good. 
you have good character removal which still woreks vs the new super mains. 
han/chewie in falcon is a nice ship but so is zuckuss in MH or an admiral with imp command.  
you don’t give away much force to any decks so that will slow them.
vs the new ewok deck you lose.  there is no way choke vader with a stick and dr e, nor tatooine maul can deal with the power of the ewok.
i’m not sure what other ls decks will be big for r3 but it doesnt matter cause you will win

i’ve never been a fan of hunt-down but i made this when coruscant came out and its not bad.  it can take a lot of damage from cheese hit and run decks like dagobah or various podrace/insert decks and still come back to win.  it gets better with r3 but it doesnt need it to win.

this is a beatdown version as opposed to dueling or racing or something.

get out vader fast and other guys and do dammage.

there is some things you can add like epic duel or a racer but you dont really need them to win with.

vs
pudprofit- start either arica ( if you want to force them to make the first move) or xixor/dr e (if you want to be aggressive).  chybc and plans hurts retrevial.  fight, damage, win.

scouts- kill the scouts, win.  

new dueler obj- play smart.  you can track/stack good destinies, so do it.  fast damage is key.

hb/flip- well you have a solid space package that can usually spread to 2 or 3 systems to probe.  you need miltiple destinies + hi destinies in space.  s and d, visage will eat them (along with drains if you successfully probe). beware suicide epp’s.

wys- a tough game.  you have good character removal.  beware beatdown. situp big at the system and catina.  fight and win.

jizz- win
