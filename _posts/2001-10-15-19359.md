Strategy: '

i hope u all saw my deck description to see why my mains r so bad.


On my first turn i pull 2 generals and i deploy crix who pulls chewie whho pulls a site(total 7 force) if i have any xtra foce i pull deactive shield generor or bunker. i keep bunker in hand until i am ready to blow it.second turn i start racing deploy more scouts try to get the shield is down(i have 3 and 2 signals). third turn i will have activated alot so maybe i deploy cruiser or tala get cap/ao going to help my scouts. fourt turn i get set up for bowing away bunker, i dedicate most of my forces to that. on the 5th turn the race should be winding down, good chance i have won (i have 23 destiny 4 or more and i pull most of my low destiny. also on the fifth turn the bunker might be blown away, or i am fighting for it. concusion gernade on bruckman helps. 

if  buker blown away and podrace won i have basically won because no hand and approx 32 card swing in 2 turns really hurts. anyway mid to end game i drain and retrieve scouts.


why cruisers? starship/pilots are almost all gone and i have enouph force  

why podrace? i need to find a way to make my opponent lose force without enhanced characters

why me? it could happen to anyone


Pease be generous concerning my current card situation
