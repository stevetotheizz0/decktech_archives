Strategy: '

First off I am allready going to be taking out Rebel Planners and Tranmission Terminated for Bacta Tank and Docking And Repair Facilities.

Another thing, the Planets that I chose were for the pilots and their bonuses their. I suppose I could have used anything but I wanted to do something a little different.

Now I played this deck last night twice. It's pretty good, but can definately use the cards that I have switched out (just wanted everyone to know the original version).
It played against a Court Of The Vile Gangster Deck and I lost 1 force per turn for the whole game till I got out Reflection then just kept loosing the same thing. ) - All in all the deck is solid.
Your first objective is to flip the objective...then once you secure that put the pilots ships in the Yavin 4 Docking Bay (if you can't secure Hoth without the pilots) then just move them to the Yavin Docking Bay from the Hoth Docking Bay, then put them on thier ships and fly them to Yavin where Haven is sitting...
Your opponent more than likely they won't come to you for fear of 2 destiny's and higher power (from EBO) so it's secured. I was essentially going to add some weapons in theire but then I decided not to because of space constrictions. There's only so many cards that you cn put into a deck. )

Another key thing that I found out is that NEVER loose from any of your 'Force Piles' I made that mistake and lost the 4th Marker (but I got it back w/Reflections) also I found that if you hold off and do it all at one time you can score big quick. The other nice thing is that the deck is almost Monnok proof (their are only a few doubles) - (it was funny I got monnok'ed last night and lost 2 Mon Cal's and that was all)

So enjoy in good health and let me know what you think.

Thanks
