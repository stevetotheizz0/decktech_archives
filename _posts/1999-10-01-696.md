Strategy: '

This deck is based around force choking your opponent.  Since Beggar has become more common then Frozen Assests (and there isn't a magic bullet for it) then that is why I included Beggar instead of Frozen Assests.  The idea is to get a quick start and go and beat down the opponent where ever he/she is.  There is also added Drazin protection in the form of noble Sac and Scrambled Transmission.'
