Strategy: '

You basically get out the main's as fast as u can to make the force loss big early in the game, if the oppenant has no space for u to engage then drain on kessel and tatooine and try and get Tatooine Celebration out asap, if your playing a dueling deck then avoid vader unless u have at least one of the dueling cards in your hand because the destinies aren't that great.'
