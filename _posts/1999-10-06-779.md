Strategy: '

  Start Arrest Order to ensure no teleport beat-down.  Flip early(this deck can do it 2nd or 3rd
turn) and take advantage of the drain bonuses.
At-St's are strictly better than characters in this deck.  With an Op aboard the vehicle there is no way to target it with weapons,Obi-text etc.
An added bonus to the vehicles which can help in battle is the Tramples and their 'react' ability.
Use Bright Center against LS Ops for zero drain.
Look Sir,droids is my favorite way to kill a Gifted droid(strong against this deck).
Finally,the Landing crafts with the cannons will
destroy RL in R1 and GL in G1(plus any other starfighter -Just About-)before you even have to lose it to attrition.
 ENJOY
