Its a fast BHMB deck. all u do is use the tactial support to get troopers out
                    of your deck. and thay all work together. thay add battle destanys together
                    so your getting 3 or 4 battle desinys in a battle. plus u play troopers assaut
                    to add to to there power. and stack a cards then u play counterassault to
                    battle again then u get to add one more destany so your now getting 4 or 5
                    desinys. then u stack one more card so u stacked 2 cards in one turn at
                    one site. thats about it tell me what u think.  '
