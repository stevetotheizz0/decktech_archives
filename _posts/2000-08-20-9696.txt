Strategy: '

This deck can be very strong, since most prepare against Rallops, or BHBM.	It activates force very early in the game.  Some like to play this deck with ties, but I thing the big ships are so much more fun.

The destiny in this deck is good and if you can count you should do very well with this deck.

Here is the basic way to play this deck.  First start Operational as planned.  For the effect I would start IAO.  That way you can pull the DSII docking bay early and get the Moff there.  Once you pull all the DSII sectors then you can docking bay him for free anywhere for better use.

This deck is not very tough to explain.  Use Imperial Command to get an Admiral, then get Piett, then use Piett to get Merrok(sp?) then use him to get your systems, and drain like crazy at your system and make them lose 2 from "that things Operation".  Do not forget the extra destiny it provides, and do not forget that Imperial Command pretty much stops the Superfalcon with all its multipy destines.  Use Imperial Barrier at the right time and you should win the game.  The Admiral Order in this deck is mainly for the cheaper deploy, but if it works for the other half then more power to you.

If you play against TIGIH...then get Luke with Vader and shuttle him up to space, I have found that is the best way.  If you play against Test decks, then make them lose early as much as possible.  If this deck is strong in your area then add Resistance.

Overall it pretty much is simple just build it and play it and you will see how much fun it really is.
