Strategy: '

The Basics On the first turn use Hidden Base to pull Tatooine from your reserve deck. Then use Insurrection to get out the Home One Docking Bay. Dont forget you can get Luke, JK down their for deploy -3. 

On your seond turn pull the one of the remaining DBs and try to contol them. 

Third Turn Repeat 

The Cards 

Wedge and Red 1 Great in space to guard Tatooine or just plop wedge down at a docking bay to drain and add to your activation. You can also always get this combo if you have one in hand using Squadron Assignments. 

Dash and Outrider Also a great ship can help deal with those pesky ties or guard Tatooine. Wins battles and great all around ship. Dash can also be used on the ground if nessasary. 

I’ll Take the Leader This card is awesome it gives you +1 force drain at all your docking bays, Helps kill ties and BH in Ships. Your ships are immune to attrition <4 or add two to their total immunity. Youve gotta love it 

Tatooine Celebration If you can get this engine running it can do you wonders + no traking needed to retrieve. 

On the Edge Just even more retieval. Game winner 

The Matchups 

Vs. BHBM This deck is tough but you can win if you get your drains set up early and use luke for attacks as far away from vader as possible. If an oppurtunity knocks beat him down in space or on the ground. Use your tricks to their fullest advatage. If you play it right retieval will win you this game. 

Vs. HDADTJ If you can kill vader and place him our of play with desparate Reach. Watch for dueling and play it smart. You can overrun visage with your retrieval and if you can get a beatdown in that would really help. One of the most difficult matchups so be careful. 

Vs. Scum These decks can be difficult, btu if you overrun the palace and cancel S & V the game is preety much over. Use their ouwn cards against them and beatdown whenever possible. Choke their force and draina little on your side. With a little bit of skill you can pull this off. 

Vs. Carbon Chamber Testing I know these will be making a comeback with the new frozen han so I better be ready. Release frozen han and replace him with the Capt. Beatdown, Retrieve, and Drain. Easy Right, but be sure you play it smart. 

Vs. Tie Swarm Beat them down with your space fleet track and use destiny adders. With Ill take the leader it should be less difficult. Use Hasshn if they try to Lateral Damage. Pay hard and you will know the true nature of the force. 

Dont you just love killing imperials?
