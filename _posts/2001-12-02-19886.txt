Forgive me if I don’t list every strat possible.

Strat
There are enough Senators to flip first turn almost every game, so do so, start digging with Lott, and pull all the political effects.  Pretty easy from there, just play well.
Card choices
Aurra and Observing - LS has exactly 2 sabers, and ~1~ obi saber is worthless.  You snag Qui-Gon’s stick chill with watto over at the junkyard and drain for 3, they aren’t coming near you.

Maul Strikes - Get Mauls stick, don’t duel.  If you have mauls stick and some stacked destiny go ahead and off qui-gon but its safer to fight him.

The Politcal effects - Key to senate.

Matchups
Hyperdrive - Replace their junkyard and slap Watto there from reserve or hand, and Maul for free to the landing site and move over.  Put charecters where they are needed and boom.

LS combat - Do not feed into their hands.  Maul stays off Naboo.  Sure, maul can’t drain.  Either lose him to thier drain or slap him at the landing site and see if they come to you.  Beat up their jedi that will most likely be alone but watch for the counter beat.

LS Senate - Control the senate (duh)  Very easy to do, even against a uber senate deck.  I’ve tried it, it works.   '
