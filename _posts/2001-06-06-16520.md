Strategy: '

Ok so basically you get the start off on the podrace in the beginning game and you get guaranteed activation pulled with Jabba’s Palace.  The SAC is completely huge against the qmc decks that think they can run all over the whole game and you can’t touch them.  Wrong, just sense that unique path of least resistance and beat down epp leia for about 12-15.  Then when you win the podrace they are left scratching their heads, after this is all done through down a presence of the force on that site you beat them off of, and drain for like 4 a turn.


Here’s some card explanations


Every JP Site Might as well get as much activation as possible.


Vader EPPs I like one character to have a guaranteed lightsaber swing whenever he hits the table.


U-3PO So when they build up their super site of 3 Jedi’s and 3 unique sabers and drain for 6 you can get the last laugh.


Little Space Because the same is true for most light decks, I’ll let QMC have the system, i’ll beat them down on the ground.


Senses These cards rule, just a superior card in the environment now.


Elis Helrot Not many people starting insurrection.....


Podracer Collision Just in case you aren’t winning the podrace.


Sniper & Dark Strike It used to be good, now it’s even better with Darth Maul.


Masterful Move Solid all around destiny 6.


Omni Box & It’s Worse Because some track better than me. -)


First strike Didn’t save force? Gonna be hard to play narrow escape or dodge now.....


Come Here You Big Coward If you lose the podrace and they only have one site......aww too bad no retrieval for them.


Dmail me with any questions.
