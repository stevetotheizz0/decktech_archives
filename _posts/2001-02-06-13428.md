Strategy: '

Updated WYS deck, 

the strategy is to flip first or second turn, and set up celebration. You should always get at least 2 battle destinies every where. on the ground use  palace raiders and patrol crafts to control the ground. I use patrol crafts because thier destiny 4, interior, and react for free.

also the epp’s help alot in the cantina,

the space in the deck is enough to hold tatooine usually, if worst comes to worst, just land in one of the DB’s.

ALL my urchins is one of the best cards in the deck. it really helps late game. fallen portals are great, and the admirals orders help alot too. Lost in the wilderness kicks ass, esspecialy since you can play it from the lost pile. 

once this deck gets going it usually wins. Just play, retrieve, and do your own thing and you will win. If you have any questions just D-mail me and ask away. '
