Strategy: 

On the first (or second) turn deploy Vader on a Battleground and immediatly flip the objective. Search for characters and sites to play the famous
and obvious Search and Destroy, plus protect the Visage with Ephant Mon or a solid defense.
The strategy is really simple: protect sites with good power, drain + Visage Of The Emperor-Search And Destroy (opponent loses 2 force each draw phase).
If opponent deploy a character on a battleground, kill him with Vader and others mains. All characters in this decks are powerful when combined with any other !

The only problem in this deck is interrupts. I've put all 'good' interrupts, but only one of each. For exemple, I need more Elis Helrot or Oota Goota Solo ?.

AGAINST HB: deploy Dreadnaught and probe everywhere with Security Prec.
AGAINST Local Uprising: deploy ABCTTU on Death Star, and 'Search And Destroy' operatives.
AGAINST MAINS: just battle.
