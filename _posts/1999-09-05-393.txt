Strategy: '

On the first (or second) turn deploy Vader on a Battleground and immediatly flip the objective. Search for characters and sites to play the famous
and obvious Search and Destroy, plus protect the Visage with Ephant Mon or a solid defense.
The strategy is really simple protect sites with good power, drain + Visage Of The Emperor-Search And Destroy (opponent loses 2 force each draw phase).
If opponent deploy a character on a battleground, kill him with Vader and others mains. All characters in this decks are powerful when combined with any other 

The only problem in this deck is interrupts. I've put all 'good' interrupts, but only one of each. For exemple, I need more Elis Helrot or Oota Goota Solo ?.

AGAINST HB deploy Dreadnaught and probe everywhere with Security Prec.
AGAINST Local Uprising deploy ABCTTU on Death Star, and 'Search And Destroy' operatives.
AGAINST MAINS just battle.'
