Strategy: '

Strategy is to deploy your characters in batches such that you get multiple destinies.  If they leave you totaly alone they are insane...  your drain potential is outrageous... to the tune of 25 per turn and 5 more in occupation....  that does a deck in in hmmm... 2 turns, if NOTHING has been deployed by the opponent.

Most of the character combinations in the deck can draw multiple destinies when together, or use Guri to limit the opponent to just one.  More strategy later on...  late, going to bed. '
