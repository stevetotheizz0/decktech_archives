I now realize the need for more systems, while some people prefer Commander Merrejk I like more systems better, with 15 ships, only 3 systems isn’t gonna be enough.

To complete the deck, get yourself a foil Imperial Decree (Decipher Prize support) like I did this morning :)

This deck sprung from my imagination one day when I decided that I needed a change from all the beatdown decks Ive been making lately and just wanted a deck that could either play a fast and furious space firefight or just lay back and drain away... how peaceful...

Turn 1: Grab Wakeelmui via Mob Points, then grab Ominous Rumors. Pull Ephant Mon and put him on the Bunker. Now it is secure for the whole game. Deploy Wakeelmui. If the opponent gave you 1 force deploy Ominous, otherwise just draw it up.

Turn 2: If you didnt already deploy Ominous do it. Deploy ships around space while slowly building up ground forces at the platform. Play smart. Win.

Why TIES?
Well I find that they are cheaper and just as effective as big blue SDs, and dont need pilots to back them up. After DS2 we got interceptors which made TIEs all the better, and with Special Edition along with the well-known Organized Attack was the lesser known All Power To Weapons, and the rest is history.

Why Endor Ops?
Because of Ominous Rumors. I could have played SYCFA, but this deck doesnt require tons of force in the first place. Draining for 2 a turn is cool, but draining for 4 is even cooler.

Imperial Decree?
Perhaps not a very well-known card, but very useful. Just occupy a battleground site and 2 battleground systems and Revolution and the opponents force drain bonuses are all cancelled. My site is the platform and the systems are whatever 2 I want of the 3.

I dont think that your ground forces will be enough to handle a full-blown LS beatdown squad.
Perhaps, but it doesnt really matter. There will obviously be at least one survivor, so just shuttle them aboard the Executor or a Dreadnaught, and Ephant is still there to count for Ominous Rumors. Even without any ground support, youre still draining for 6 force a turn, 8 with Presences out, and retrieving and cancelling force drains at the same time.

8 TIEs? Dont swarm decks use like 15?
Actually its 14 cuz of the Sword and the Shield, but whatever. The reason is that the one advantage that TIEs have over X-wings is that you can retrieve with them. So I dont need lots of them to be strong. I could do that, but with only 3 systems to drain at, why?

Well I hope that you find inspiration in this deck. Try it. Itll take the stress out of your day.
