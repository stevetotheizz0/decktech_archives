Strategy: '

This is the deck i played at Comic-Con and it went 3-1 which i was happy with.  Its only lost to a BoomRace deck where i couldnt get any guys into the Bunker.


It may not be the Strongest deck out there but they have to come to you or lose a force every turn.  If they dont come to you Elis your guys over for beatdown.  


The deck has alot of beatdown.  With a few characters you can kill alot.  Using You are beaten, Ponda Baba Dr e and D Strike you can create a beatdown.  


Why off Court  I play this off court because of the Direct Damage and being able to pull your Independent Ships.  Pulling the Ships helps out alot and the direct damage helps if theyre plaing space.  + you can pull docking bays which gives you the Elis Option that you wouldnt have with IAO.


Mobil Points  It sucks when they cancel it with Dont do that again but it only slows you down.


Card Explanations


Look Sir Droids  You can Kill of a main driod like Threepio with Parts, Bantha Droid, Artoo Threepio..  any of these you can take out which can help alot.


Ice Plains  Anti EBO and extra force if you draw it.  Oh well for the floating 0 if you can kill EBO.


Blast Door Controls  Kills Barrier and Narrow which is quite annoying.


Deck Matchups


WYS  Control the Cantina as soon as you can.  Try not to get killed off Tatooine.  Try to set up beatdown against some of their smugglers and try and knock them off kessel.  If you play it right you should win.  


EBO  Get your Ice Plains out somehow and set up search and destroy.  Drain of the Ground and try to kill their main drain site(kiffex) or something like that.  With Direct Damage and drains you should win.


RST  This is hard matchup.  I think you can ping them away for enough in the end.  Most of them Dont play space so you can easily control Endor and drop down Battle order.  They 8 force loss will hurt.  Try not to let them get into the bunker but if they do dont worry about it.  


RST Racing  This is a hard matchup.  Use Sebulba to stall them out and make them use Interrupt Cards.  Get Serect plans out to stop them from retrieving.  Try to grab OOC if they play it.  Control Endor with Battle Plan and try to hit them for lots of damage after they blow up the Bunker.  


Racing  Play Sebulba to stall them out and playing Interrupts.  Serect Plans the Race and you should be ok.  Thats the only reason i play Him.  If he gets damaged unless you have a chance of winning dont lose the force.


Thanks for reading.  If you have any advice or questions d-mail me and ill get back to you as soon as i can.  later.. '
