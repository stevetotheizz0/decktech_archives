Strategy: 

The purpose of this deck is to destroy Alderaan while minimizing opponents drains against
you. Youll manage to blow A in about 3-4 turns. So it will happen quite fast.
There is a lot of ways to keep your force loss limited to what you can easily handle.
Start with Battle Order in allmost every case, so early draining will cost.
Strategic reserves will also help: get Gunner, cancel drain, deploy him, search for LASER
and so on... youll end up stopping their best drain allmost every turn(untill you flip).

When you finally flip, just start invading space. Play systems from reserve and begin to
summon your tremendous fleet. There is a horde of destroyers so you should have no shortage
for space power. Retrieving capabilities of this deck are awesome and allmost unmached!
Keep destroyers coming! If opponent kills few, deploy more and retrieve and so on...

Activation should not be a problem. With your Death Star and its sites you get a lot while
your friend gets none. Also systems provide a bunch for you both. Mobilization points 
not includet, because they just get suspendet in early game when they are most usefull.

Important! Remember when you flip you are no longer immune to battle damage at the moon.
So gather your crew to avoid beatdowns!

If opponent plays ground, he can attempt to take your DS-sites. This must be stopped!
Many of your pilots are mains istead of whimpy admirals, so they can fight at ground also.
And remeber to "Put all sections on alert"! 

In overall this deck focuses on heavy draining and even heavier retrieval and drain stopping.
Play wise and patiently and you will win!

Why not "Imperial command" deck??? Because of "Dont do that again" it gets grabbed very early.
And quickly controlled Docking bays no longer provide huge activation. Also admirals arent
very usefull in ground warfare. Multiple destinies is stopped by two Guris!

Why not more DS-sites??? Because you want flip soon, and you dont want to have any zeros
appearing as your destinies.

If SAC is popularin your area, replace "Oppressive Enforcement" with the combo version.

Some card explanations:

Vader with saber: Best Vader for this kind of deck. No room for his saber.

Captain Godlherdt: Anti Landing claw.

Daroe: With the number of star destroyers he can(and will) suprise you opponent!

Tarkins orders: Cancels a bunch of often played cards. Also can stop drains several times.

And some matchups:

WYS: Tricky. They will kill some of your activation, so be patient and gather force.
You will retrieve/stop enough drains to survive of their early upperhand.
Then eventually conquer space and the game is yours! Be sure to take each system with
at least two destroyers(preferrably with 3-4!), incase they play beatdown verion.
Crush them with your power! Guri will save you from their destinies. Battle deployment will help.

QMC/RST: Easy. Take space. Win drain race! Your   retrieval will be to much for them.

TIGH: 	Just see that your power is enough in battles and game is yours.

Podracing: You have no podracer, because if they do Podracing you will lose the race.
But no problem! Just retrieve damage what they have caused. I did it! wont hurt you too much!

EBO: Take space and win. Destroy Hoth and smile! If they play swarm, keep your boats at
groups and Battle deployment with Thrawn will eat their power.

Profit:	Real drain race coming up with this deck. Their direct damage will hurt, 
but your draining and retrieval potial is higher so you should win.

Mains: If they play docking bays use Fanfare. Theyll probably try take your sites, so be
prepared to fight there. Kill them with drains!

MBO: Take fight to Yavins ground. Kill their Assault run boosters and take their sites!
Your mains will crush their weak characters. Destroy Yavin 4 and win!

Thats about all I could remember. So thanks for your rewiews!
