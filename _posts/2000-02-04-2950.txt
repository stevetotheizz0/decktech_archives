Strategy: 

A few things...

1. This is finally 60 cards!!!
2. I took the deck and changed it accordingly to your guys reviews
3. I dont have a Mara nor a Maras saber so I need this months prize!  Help!

Start Tatooine: Cantina and Combat Readiness for JP. Get the AC and the Dungeon (AC first, Dungeon second).

The 3 Twi'leks make up for the Combat Readiness start, pull anything you need first turn.  Masterful Moves are extremely sweet 6 destiny recyclers.

My favorite strategy is to drop Vader (or Mara) with his (or her) saber to Cantina and start draining for 3. You can do this fairly easily 2nd turn. Its a nice way to start out the game and usually it will go unopposed for a couple turns.

Anyway, heres the gameplan:

vs Ops: Play a Bright Center on their planet then beat the hell out of them. The ECCs go a long way with Dr. Evazan. Kill the Operatives and beat the little guys. Battle Plan helps too.

vs Hidden Base: Twi'lek for Security Precautions early. This is where you pop out the 2nd turn drain of 4 too. Hit em early, but dont put your ships out until they flip. Then when they do flip, drop 3-4 ships and probe every system that you can.

vs Martin Faulke HB: Alter Our Most Desperate Hour and start draining. Try and get rid of their mains using Evazan and tracked destinies. Build up an Army at Alderaan and Tatooine, if possible. Lateral Damage the Falcon. You can beat this deck. Just make sure you have Secret Plans out, you have an Army at Alderaan and you are holding an Alter for OMDH.
