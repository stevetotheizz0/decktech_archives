Strategy: 

Basics: You wait until your opponet deploys on the ground or in space then you lay a huge beatdown and take over his sites and drain. You have good forfiet so don’t woory to mauch about being attacked. Just drain and battle the game away.

This is a fun deck, but it can also win like a champ if you want.
