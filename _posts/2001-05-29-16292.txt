Strategy: 

this deck was very successful - but is raped by many cards in tatooine.  mobilization points is necessary to the deck, and "Don’t Do That Again" wrecks this, as well as the Republic characters (which can deploy to the spaceport docking bay i place at Coruscant regardless of whether i have a star destroyer at the system or not).  i enjoy playing isb and would appriciate any input that may help me adapt to the post-tattoine meta game.  when rating this deck, please rate it as a B.T. deck (before tatooine) and again i appriciate any input!
