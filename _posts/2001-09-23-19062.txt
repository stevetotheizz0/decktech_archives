Strategy: '

This deck obviously starts with podracing, and it usually wins. that 22 force swing (6+5 from watto&#8217;s box. 11 force each way) Start with watto&#8217;s box. I was thinking about adding in a Prepared defenses so if they start with racing, i can start with watto&#8217;s box and some other stuff, and if they don&#8217;t i can still start racing. 

Now for the matchups 
TISGIH w/scouts If you can drop some destroyer droids early enough, you can usually take out maideine and disrupt their entire game unless they play with a secong one (a very rare occasion since they can pull him with strike planning) 

Against racing with odds as it stands now, this deck would probably get it&#8217;s butt handed to it, but i can&#8217;t figure out what to take out to add that preped defenses so start with some other effects (such as YCHF to stop odds and IAO to pull docking bays) 

Against Hidden Base w/out racing this deck usually just uses b-wings with intruder missiles in conjunction with rebel artillery to inflict major damadges( that&#8217;s a lot of 7&#8217;s) just use the starships to the best of your ability and just kinda stick to the ground. 

I am open to any suggestions, positive or negatice or whatever, but don&#8217;t just rate it lower just because you think the strategu section is shorter than all thos 12 page strategy articles out there. and don&#8217;t give it a 1/2 star just cause you think the destinies are too low to win the race, because against all decks except racing with odds with a $hit Load of 7&#8217;s and 6&#8217;s.
