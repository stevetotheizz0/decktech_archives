OK. Strategy
I've added the Rebel Base docking bays in case of need of an emergency flip. I have 5 more agents and a couple more blue cards than before. I took out Coruscant because Blount always tried to fly there and I found it difficult to kill him there. HOTJedi will never be a problem coz you have 4 downloadable BG's. 2 Nevar Yalnal's and Lt. Pol will be able to handle any sneaky bastards. And sorry folks, Mara just doesn't fit into the deck for me. Sim Aloo proved to be better against tracked destiny. Plus he just looks so angry in the picture. I dropped about 85% of my non-agent characters, but the never ending supply of agents makes it worth it. Let me know what you think.'
