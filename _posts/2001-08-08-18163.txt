Strategy: 

Well this deck might not seem like much, but it will be a strong deck in the post-Coruscant tourney scene. Some of the cards may seem out of place, but everything is in for a reason.

Card Choices:

Forest: An average site which helps because your dudes have immunity to all attrition here, and another site for Amidala’s Celebration.

Amidala x3: Shes the most important part in the deck, because she lets you retrieve force at the Naboo sites. It is a must to get her out early. 

Security Route: With the 2 db’s this should be easy to pull off. Adds two to drain at a site next door. With Luke, his stick, Proficiency, and this you can amount to a pretty big drain at the site next door.

A Vergence in the Force: A crucial card against walkers or Speed Deal. Can really slow the force loss down in the early game so you can get the celebration set up. 

All the senators do something good, also help control the senate, so they are needed. 
__________________________________________________

Early game: First turn deploy the Naboo and spaceport DB’s from reserve to Naboo and control them. Control the senate and try to get Amidala there ASAP. She is the basis of your deck. Use Mindful of the Future to get the rest of your sites out also. Control at least two sites on Naboo and have Amidala at the senate for draining and retrieval. Maybe use a Vergence in the Force for a big early game drain, like against Speed Deal or Walkers (like described before).

Mid-Game: Try to have most to all of your sites out by now, and be controlling them with people. Keep the steady retrieval and drains going. Not all that much to say. 

End-Game: By now all of the Naboo sites should be controlled and the retrieval will be in full swing. Control the system for huge drains and win. If you still have a lost pile, use Nar Shaddaa Wind Chimes with Gungans and retrieve some more. You should have the game in the bag.

All games are the same, except for speed deal. Use your Qui-Gon, Luke, Panaka, and others to attack their pepl. Try to knock them off of Bespin with all of the early activation you get. Knock them out of the sector and system drain away as you please. This will be a fairly easy matchup but play with caution early and you will end up with a big reward. 

Cards that wreck this deck. Battle Order and Secret Plans. If you have to pay to drain and retrieve it will just suck so much. O well. This deck is still very solid and can win most games.
Thanks very much for reading and reviewing, if you see any problems, plz d-mail me instead of giving bad reviews, unless this deck REALLY SUCKS!
The future world champion, Phil
