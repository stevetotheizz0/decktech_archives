Objective: (1)
Imperial Occupation/Imperial Control




Strategy: 

Start with Imperial Occupation, Yavin 4, Forest and Imperial Arrest Order.  You can change what you start depending on what your opponent is playing.  Just drop Imps like crazy until you have most of your sites under control.	Then play Organa's Ceremonial Necklace to get drains of at least 2 everywhere.  Those healthy drains really add up for the opponent.  Bad Feeling will take slow Mains & Toys down, as well as Wounded Wookiee.  Oppressive Enforcement provides SAC protection.  Set up Imperial Decree quick to slow LS drains.	You're pretty safe from beatdown, but there's plenty of power if the beatdown comes.	IAO boosts forfeit of nearly all of your characters.  Stick Failure at Dagobah: Cave to put a hurting on your opponent.  Hell To Pay takes care of manip.  With Security Precautions and all the ships, HB is pretty well taken care of.  Vesden is great for numbers.	Pretty well rounded, should have a good chance against almost every deck type.	Ideas and tips are greatly appreciated.
