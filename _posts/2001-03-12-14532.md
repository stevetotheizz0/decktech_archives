Please don’t rate this deck so bad, because I will have a revised edition soon. I thought people could write reviews to help me fix my deck, but obviously not. Sorry for this horrible deck.


You start out with Dagobah, and after I get Mind What You Have Learned this deck would probably fare better. The main reason I am submitting this deck is not to get a good rating but to get constructive criticism, this is my first try at a Dagobah Training deck, with no outside help. I just use this deck to force drain the heck out of the opponent and if they come to Dagobah, attack their arse.
