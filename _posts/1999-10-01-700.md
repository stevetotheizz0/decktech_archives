Strategy: '

Parts of this deck were taken from the Maelstrom v3.1 deck.  The retreival is a good asset to EBO because it takes so much to set up and you may be taking it from operative drains or visage.

this deck is pretty fast and get setup usually by turn three or definately four.

some combos I like

electrobinoculars + hiding in the garbage = a good way to setup quicker.

insurrection + EBO you already have half the sites you need to setup the war room plus the docking bay.  this way you can cut back on doubles needed for drawing the sites.'
