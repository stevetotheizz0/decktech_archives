Strategy: '

Start with Jundland wastes, use Combat Readiness to fetch JP. First turn grab the Audience Chamber. This is a great start in itself It gives a drain location, lets you fetch an alien and provides loads of Revolution-free activation. Mainly though, this will be devastating to a YCEBBT (Profit) deck. Their generation will be killed before they even take a turn, and you'll have free aliens at the AC (I recommend that you take Jabba as one of them).
It's lay, drain and battle from then on. 4 Vaders, 2 Tarkins, 2 Maras for obvious benefits. 2 vader's sabers in there too for drain/YaB/slicing. Pretty self-explanatory really. S/A and Barrier stop beatdowns, then Elis over to do some battling of your own in your turn. I would like to fit in a Point Man and a Resistance. If you see an opportunity to fit those in, please mention it. '
