Strategy: 

Note:  take out sense and alter and put in one nebulan frigate and kiffex.

O.k. start by getting E.B.O. out by the second turn. You should get a signal in your starting hand to pull garrison out. If not, pull it and war room out with secret base. Deploy the rouges (hobbie,or zev)and then draw up. Second turn pull out final echo site and ebo and any systems you have. Third turn start spreading out in space, a nebulon-b with pilot on should take care of early engagements. Get out bacta tank early and hold a control in hand to stop alters. Clean your deck of locations as soon as possible so you dont have to worry about them in battles. If opponent plays ground dont worry, just start deploying rontos. Power three, destiny 5, and cant be battled is a great combo. Feel free to plop down ability four characters and battle (not many bad destinys so dont worry you should start clearing the site) Use the tank and Houjixs whenever you lose and warriors courages to make the opponent pay for battling. You may lose battles but it will hurt your opponent more in the long run. Always lose your character to the tank and leave the ronto at the site. Put figran in your war room or aboard a nebulon-b and start retreiving your one a turn. It may not sound like much, but getting anything back is great. Soon battles and drains will wear away at your opponent. Remember to keep the signals cycling with traffic control if you have it out, their ability if it isnt.

Court-Start ebo and then deploy ability four characters on tatooine. Use Houjix and Warriors Courage to do damage yet take none, and use tank. Your drains will overcome.

Hunt Down-Not a problem. Keep luke in the air. corran horn and transmission terminated to take out visage, but ONLY when vader is out. Pop characters down kill vader whenever you can. Drains should kill opponent.  

Big Blue- can be a problem. Load ships with pilots for forfeit fodder and mass at a few sites. You may lose the battles but the attrition should take a bigger toll on opponent. Dont make bad mistakes and youll do fine. Your big destinys will win the day.

TIE retreival- this can hurt, but it will be a fun battle and if you lose, it shouldnt be by much.

This deck has not lost a game yet which doesnt mean it wont, but at least it is fun for you and keeps your opponent wondering and being cautious. Go Rontos
