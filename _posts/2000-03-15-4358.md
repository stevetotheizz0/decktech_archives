Strategy: '

Normal start is Obi's Hut with Careful Planning for Mos Eisley (Tosche if you think you'll need activation). If you play Hunt Down, start Goo Nee Tay instead, so you don't provide a battleground, and so Vader is depoy +2.

Vs. Hunt Down
Try to get Obi or Luke to a battleground, then try to get Transmission Terminated or a spy to cancel Visage. This way the Dark Side is also losing from Visage.

Once I get a decent beatdown, the game will most likely shift my way, since most Hunt Downs don't have many ways to retreive.

Vs. Raltiir Ops
Get characters down to Raltiir before they flip, it'll make it much easier to prevent the flip, than trying to flip it back.

If they flip quickly, just Nabrum a hit squad over to Raltiir. Sense will help to cancel some reacts if they are playing with Speeders or AT-STs.

Vs. COTVG
This will probably be the hardest game, especially if they flip. Try to take over the AC before they get back-up there... it'll probably cost you, but it'll make up for it in the long run.

Stay clumped together unless you have some Nabrums or tracked destinies, then just spread and drain. It'll be a long game, but if you get the Cantina shuffle going, it'll get easier.

Vs. TDIGWATT
Probably will be a hard game if they get Dark Deal set up. Try to take over CC early with mains and use the limited ships to control Bespin Cloud City. '
