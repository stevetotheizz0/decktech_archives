Strategy: '

First turn deploy Maul for free and play squabbling delagates to get out Lot Dod or another with blockade.

 When flipped you can get two cards out of their hand by using the objective and one with defensive fire, so if the opponent has five cards in hand you can play limited resources and it is non unique so four plus force loss and still setting up some lovely drains on tatooine(of course)and occupation.

Against any deck that should be your startagy as most opponents have a very little hand.


Card choices

Maul strikes;Pull out that lovely double handed lightsaber what other reason do you need.


Squabbling delagates;Pull out your important senators and can be used as a abyssin ornament to cancel a force drain on This Is Outragous


3x Maul; Get him out quicker and to help with your mains at some battleground.
