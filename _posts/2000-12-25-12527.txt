Strategy: '

DECK EDIT START>>>>
I need to add some good ground interrupts, but don’t have the room, i’m aware that the space is really overpowered, but EBO is big here and I need to be prepared.
<<<<DECK EDIT END

Your overpowered Endor Operations deck here.
Deploy speeder bikes and pilots for heavy defense.
Grab Establish Secret Base first, then Ominous Rumors so that you don’t spread out too far.
Combat Response will pull you many good ships and their pilots so that they can help your space armada destroy the traitorous legions of the vile rebels.
Oh yeah, I almost forgot, the main point of this deck is not winning, but coming in first place. Therefore, have fun while you pick your opponents valued Home One apart by a well placed Intruder Missle (evil laugh)
