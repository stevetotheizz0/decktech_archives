Strategy: 

I’m not very good at this part.deploy palpatine and vader on conquest (at death star 2).then deploy all of the other fighters and characters to conquest or vengence.move all of them together (fighters, star destroyers, and people) to the next planet with light side inhabitants.destroy all enemies at any cost.continue until light side is destroyed.make sure to stock up on force and get as little force drains on yourself as possible.
