Strategy: 

Ok, Before you jerks rate this a 1/2 star JUST because of Onee Ta, Just dont even bother to review it, I have played against Onee ta with this deck and I crushed it. You guys fail to forget that MOST decks that use Onee Ta are Aliens who have to stay on tattoine to be any good. They are *&%&*% on ralltiir. This deck can get around it. Just Wait to see what  your oppoenent is going to do. If they DOn’t Start Onee ta, go about playing the deck normally. If they dp start it, go straight to thier planet. Once you secrure it with Vader, Tarkin, Mara, and whoever else, put everyone else on Ralltiir and flip. Pretty easy. Thanks to those who will give this deck a FAIR review.
