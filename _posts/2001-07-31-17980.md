Strategy: '

it’s late so i’ll keep it short

First off the destiny breakdown is as follows

6 = 2

5 = 17

4 = 14

3 = 6

2 = 3

1 = 10

0 = 4

pretty much you are begging them to podrace with you If not, any battles that come about will be over before you know it. First off if the opponent deploys 2 aliens then wait until you have some good power in your hand. Then come down and try for 1 big battle to get han out. If it doesn&#8217;t work the first time then its ok, remember that if you don&#8217;t wait too long then all you lose will be retrived upon freeing han. Once he is free then grab tessek and then tanus with YWTMTJN. Plop bo shudda at the chamber, spread around 1 elom per main (2 for han) and then drain Max drain in here is 12 and then add in the profit damage. Lando isn&#8217;t in here because I don&#8217;t have one. Space isn&#8217;t in here because there&#8217;s no room (plus nobody uses battle order here) so it should do well

LMK what I should add in or take out


thanks
