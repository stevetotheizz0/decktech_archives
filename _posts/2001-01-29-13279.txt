Strategy: 

Basic Strategy: WIN! If they don’t come to you just drain them from reserve deck at the Audience Chamber with Mosep and Galid with a little backup. Start with No Bargain to make rebels Deploy +2 each and if it is a main use none shall pass and return them to their hand. You can get a drain of 6 from reserve deck if you get the sites down. Get Myo, Xizor and Jabba discussing Poltics and 4-LOM with gun all at the audience chamber and they have no chance. Put Guri there too if you want. If space is a problem put Myo as a passenger aboard a starship with 4-LOM aboard ZiMH and Guri aboard stinger. You have Myo for Forfeit with adding 2 destiny for a total of 3 destiny. Put Restraing bolt on Artoo and Threepio so 4-LOM with gun, IG with gun, and guri cant be battled. Put IG with gun alone and capture guys with bounty on them with SNIPER. Use hutt smootch to capture undercover spies (Ex. Boushh). I dont have any more cards that could help out this deck so please dont say " add another Scum and Villany" cause i dont have one to add. The only cards Have that i could put in to help this deck out are some more commons and uncommons.
