Strategy: '

Well, I went into making this deck with the problem on my mind that the dark side, well, could stand to be just a tad quicker.  So, I'm sure everyone out there has already thought of this, but I put together Imperial Arrest Order (to get my docking bays) and Mobilization Points (to generate as much as 2 or 3 force per DB) to get my activation up as quickly as I can.  All the games that this deck has played have been won by sheer power and numbers (just kept coming at the light side), with only a couple of exceptions.
Light Side space decks, completely focused decks, could prove to be tricky, the key element to focus on here is to either stay away from them in space, or mass for one huge battle and crush them in one strong hit.  Most of the time I set up drains on the ground and go from there.  Things are exceptionally good when Luke hits a starship (though it'll be hard to lure your opponent into not giving Luke to you, but it can happen).  Simply toss Vader out and let Your Destiny take him for a ride.  Most of the sites in the deck are also Mobile sites, which means Crush the Rebellion is your best friend from now on.  Also, between Emperor's Power, Imperial Command, and I Have You Now, you should have no problem with destiny... just the flaw of the deck is its generally low destiny draw.	Track Battle Order, Flagship Executor, and the Dreadnaughts for nice destiny draws (don't forget Oppressive Enforcement).  If (which is a general occurance) your opponent decides to come chase you with Luke, sacrifice the fact that Your Destiny is working and get Vader on a Combat Vehicle... Luke'll come running into a squad of Tempest Scouts led by Igar on Tempest 1 and Vader on Scout 2 packing a I Have You Now just for Luke.  The only other way to deal with Luke is to duel him (track the big destiny draws, win a few, stack Insignicant Rebellion, make him lose 4 each time) and then go for the turn once you get about 3 or 4 stacked.  Most of the time though you'll be the one hunting down your opponent, so happy hunting  Don't forget that if your opponent isn't worth going after to set your system drains up (each one is a starting 2, 3 if Chiraneau is lurking out there, 4 if you drop a pres, lure him out to fight you).  Feedback'll be lovely, suggestions too  Yes, I know Rise My Friend and Force Lightnings'll help, but supply and demand, and I don't have the supply.  I'll just have to update it later )'
