SOME STRATEGY 

pretty simple really.use the dagobah text to get a site every turn. once you have out crix (apprentice) yoda (mentor) and your 3 sites jedi test. once thats done with your opponents drains are near nothing. next you go for the asteroids. the whole game you draw all your cards trying to get them. boussh, tk422 and projection help to limit the opponents drains to even less then with great warrier. with asteroid sanc and lost relay ( if opponent comes to the asteroid which he probably will) you can dish out some good direct damage. then when i need to retrieve some force i just rycars run. if i have 2 closers in my hand i will be able to do this in 2 turns. and then with leebo on table after i complete the run theres even more direct damage ( of 1). the biggest problem i have in this deck is getting my ships out. thats why i included 3 signals to get out my encampment. once encampment is out i use squad assignments to deploy the ship and pilot to bog clearing then during my move phase i lift off to dagobah. or if i get out endor early i just deploy there or i can just deploy to my fields if they are out . so it shouldnt be to hard. i went with endor b/c this isnt really a draining deck, instead of 2 force im giving them none now which i think in this deck is much better. i switched out chewie protector for chewbacca b/c chewbacca is much better in space and i wont be using him to much on the ground.im using cracken and tala 1 b/c while they are in the asteroids they are maneuver 6 which is pretty good in my oppionion. i dont have blount and tala 2 simpily b/c i dont have tala 2.



MATCHUPS 

BHBM just play like you normally would once they get out vader deploy from reserve luke and try to keep him alive or just give him to vader and hope opponent dosent win any battles to cross him 


Hunt Down try to stay away from vader as much as possible. to cancal visage i have tk422 boussh cracken and transmission terminated. and then just play your deck as normal 


TIES this will hurt me. there is nothing i can realy do about them. im actually helping them lose there ties then redeploy them and retrieve force(since they can just go to the fields and die) all i can really do is keep my ships together and hope i keep my direct damage goin. this will prove to be a very tough match up 


TDIGWATT jedi test 1 will reduce there drains(even though that dosent matter that much) then i use boussh and tk422 to pretty much stop them. and also cloud city occupation will start to hurt me so either i dont let them control bespin or i get out my direct damage right away. this shouldnt be to hard 


COURT/MKOS this may be a little diffacult. just cancel there drains (and i think boussh or tk422 will stop the direct damage but im not sure)this should be challenging as well.
