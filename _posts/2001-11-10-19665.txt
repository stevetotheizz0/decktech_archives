Strategy: '

The Idea is to set up vader at the core, by either pulling him with Blizard 4 or just drawing, use Nemodian Advisor to get some systems and the docking bay and battle plains. At this point any good player will be out producing me sice I gave him so many benificial sites. Only have 1 force icon on him the entire set of sites. This is when Image of the Dark Lord goes down on the docking baym shutting down all their activation on naboo. Assuming I control all the naboo sites I can drain for 10 with establish control on the table, and thats witout sticks or space. The Skrills are there for the destiny and abyssian ornament. I know this wouldnt beat a LS combat deck, Probably wouldn’t beat WYS or Profit, but this is what I have, what do you think?

Edit #1  I have a Prepared Defenses coming in the mail, and when it gets here belive me It will be going in, Tarkin is there, you must have missed him.  I’ll Attempt to get an imperial Arrest and Secret Plans.  The Nemodian Advisor Cards and Twi’lek Advisor cards will stay in even when I get Prepared Defenses for pulling of battlegrounds and effects.
