Strategy: 

Alright first off there is no objective and I want it that way. Anyway, start by pulling Rendili by using MP. Use IAO to pull the docking bays. First docking bay you should pull is executer docking bay and the deploy M’iiyoom Onith there. By turn 2 you should be activating 7 force. The max amount of force you can activate is 18 force. With MP and IAO you can get some mondo generation. Use all the manipulator cards to keep the good cards out of his hands. Use the troopers and Abyssin Ornament to retrieve force. Use there’ll be **** to pay to grab that CC interuppt.

Why certain cards aren’t in here
Blasters-din’t have any room
Elite Squad Troopers-no need, not enough room
