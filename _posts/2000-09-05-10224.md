This was my screw up post but I am fixing it since some dumb kid gave my other deck a 1/2 star for no reason (I don't mind getting low rating as long as you point out something that will benifit my deck. I HATE it when people give 1/2 just because they are bored). So here we go.

First turn get out Endor or Dagobah & Yoda*s Hut. By your third turn you should be activating 9 at the least (Endor 2/0, Dagobag 2/2, Yoda*s Hut 2/0, R.Point 2/0) while only giving 2 away. As you can see I do NOT flip my objective, but instead use it to pull systems for big force activation. I know this is different activation then using docking bays but I have my reasons. I really don't like the docking bay activation because it forces you to waste characters at those sites and you are VERY open for a big beatdown. I have tried out Docking Bay decks and it really isn't worth it when you can just pull systems out that give you the same amount of activation (b/c you never control more then 2 Docking Bays in docking bay decks). Using systems is MUCH safer as well as much less character consuming. Now I know using the Hidden Base objective hurts my drains in space but draining is not my purpose. This is a mains & toys deck with the objective of beating down it*s opponent. Now if you get a few drains in as well then that*s great. This deck can beat almost anything b/c it is able to win in space & on the ground. One big factor is my HEAVY package of Sense & Alter. With honer of the Jedi Sense & Alter is more deadly then ever since you don't have to lose 2 force from *There is no Try.* If your opponent is playing with There is no Try (or playing BHBM/Hunt Down) then just lose *Your Insight Serves You Well* to pull *Honer of the Jedi* and you are set. One other nice factor in this deck*s favor is the manipulator protection. With Scambled Transmission, Shocking Info, and your heavy S/A this deck makes short work of any manip deck.
I use EPP Leia instead of Bosssh b/c she is critical to the Super Falcon against Ties.

Now for some deck matchups.

AGAINST BHBM This is the most popular deck out there for dark at the moment which is why I made a deck that could beat it. BHBM*s main advantage is it*s force activation. But with all the systems out this deck can almost match BHBM*s activation which is a BIG step to victory. Another BIG factor is your heavy S/A which is a bigger package then a normal BHBM deck*s (most BHBM decks have a ratio of 2-3 where I have 2-6). With BHBM*s S/A smashed (b/c of your S/A) you can avoid many of the unpleasent *Red* cards that those decks normally pack (like Lat.Damage, Imp. Barrier, YAB, etc) as well as protect your red cards. Get some draining going and then hit them where they are weak. Without their nasty red cards BHBM decks will not be able to top this deck in battles. Two big factors are *Mantellian Savip* & *Bacta Tank.* using these 2 effects you will be able to recycle/keep your characters while BHBM keeps losing theirs. The battles may be bloody but with the help of Savip & Bacta (I have 2 Signals in this deck so I can pull them fast) you will win the war. If your opponent is playing with Imperial Command then just grab/sense teh card and then beat on their Generals/Admirals. So far I am 6-1 against BHBM decks so, as you can see, this deck is very solid.

AGAINST TIES They SHOULD start *There is no Try* & *Opppresive Enforcement* so you will need to pull Honer fast (with Your Insight Serves You Well). One of the first effects to pull is *What're you trying to push on Us?* to catch their *All power to weapons* when they play it. Get your activatin set up (you should activate more then your opponent) as well as some ground drains (if you have time) and wait for them to move. Use your S/A wisely and things should go smooth. When they play *All power to weapons* grab it and then sense it (that way it is canceled as well as kept from going to your opponent*s used pile).
using this tactic as well as *Mantellian Savip* & *Bacta Tank* will clinch the game for you. Also if you can try to get rid of SFS since it will make the game much easier. If ties are popular in your area I might sudgest adding another What're you trying to push on Us?. If you don't play really bad then this game will be a W for you.

AGAINST ENDOR OPS Play kinda like ties exsept get out *Mantellian Savip* & *Bacta Tank* ASAP (they will be game winners). S/A any attempts to cancel your two stuff as well as their important effects/interrupts (like Lateral Damage). Menace Fades is VERY nice against this deck since it cancels the drain bonus of Ominous Rumors. If you can get Savip & the tank out you will win.

AGAINST COURT This game is really over from the start. Get some good force activation going as well as Honor out. Just take your time and hit them where they are weak (bounty hunters are easy to hit as well as LOW forfeit). If they are using All Wrapped Up then get out Savip to avoid loses your mains. There really isn't any way of losing to a COURT deck (unless you play HORRIBLE) so just sit back and watch those bounty hunters see the power of the Jedi.

AGAINST ROPS Get onto their planet fast to try and prevent the flip. If they flip it"ll be a lot harder but Savip/Tank will help take the bite out of their high destinies. Then just wear them away with battles & Order to Engage. It*ll be tough but if you play well and get your cards out you can win.

AGAINST HUNT DOWN There is almost NONE of this deck type where I play (Please remember this when rating) but I have added a Courage of a Skywalker just in case. As I said I really havn't played this much but here*s how it should go. Pull Honer out ASAP and bide your time as well as getting set up. This will cause your opponent to deploy Darth as well as try to occupy 3 BG*s (maybe). Drain in space as well as on the ground and hit your opponent with beats whenever you can. If it is no dueling iy should be a piece of cake. If you have dueling in your area ADD GLANCING BLOW and be careful. Also you do have 6 sense so if he/she starts a duel and you have 3+ sense in your hand there is a very good chance of sensing the duel.

PLEASE READ If you think I live on Savip or the Tank you are wrong. They are just MONSTERS which every deck with S/A to protect them should use. I know Savip is only useable if you lose but it is HUGE vs Ties or big mains beats. Tank is just a GREAT recycling tool that will annoy the heck out of your opponent.

Thanks for reviewing my deck. If you have any questions PLEASE D-Mail me (CmdCorrenH) before rating my deck. THANKS again.
