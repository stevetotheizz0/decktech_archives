Strategy: '

this deck allows you a lot of choice. you have enough stuff to rescue han first turn.
ideal starthe puts fett and mara at the chamber to start. i use signal and start with scramble.
opening hand master luke, choke. deploy luke, return fett to opponents hand, play choke on mara to cancel her immunity, seh cant draw destiny cause of scramble, i draw a 1 he has to lose mara, i control, free han, then flip the objective.

vs.hdadtj 2 obis, 3 lukes, 2 leias in a battling deck will keep the objective's '0' side up.  also with the obj. and tat celebration, i can retrieve all the force i lose to visage.

vs.isbthier drains will hurt me, but hopefully tptiff will slow them down, also my mains and toys will beat on thier ors.

vs.cotvg thier mini-visage wont work, use the skiffs to react to and from battles and drains.

vs.cctthey freeze whoever, i lose 8 force, next turn flip the obj, retrieve 10. while they try to get to the chamber, i set up my beatdown crew on tatooine, and spread out the mains so they lose force from the objective.

vs.tdigwatti'll proball have to go to bespin to fight, but i think my mains and interrupts can beat thiers.

vs.raltirrthis will be tough, but while they get mabey a +5 added to one destiny, i'll add 5 destiny's.

the choice on when to flip is yours. what should i add? what should i take out? thanks for your input.


in response to previuus reviews-
1. i have 2 obis in here because of immunity, and he can make a character of ability=1 move away in battle.
2.i have boussh and "a gift" to use as spies. "a gift " not only blocks drains, but opponents drains are -1 and destinys -2 wherever they have an alien (very useful vs. dark ejp objective). Also i was going to include 2 leias anyway, it was either boussh or premiere, i picked boussh cause she can block drains.
3. i have been pondering removing the falcon and redemption and both lando's, and just using lando in falcon. if i ever get a tantive or spiral i will add them. '
