Strategy: '

This is Dominic s MKOS deck. Its an usual MKOS deck. A battle deck. But, it got card to counter WYS. Endor Ops witch cancel celebration. Guri @#$%. Monnok. Its usualy enough

Just remember if you need guri. look at your deck for a site. if guri is not there you can draw. Else you can battle or whatever you like. Its so easy to have her.

you can also monnok. battle, retrieve monnok. massa move for it...

against deck

EBO or space deck well its a easy match up. you can do a first turn gailid. put S&D fast. Go fight him in space if you need to. If you really fear that deck, switch YCHForever for resistance.

All kinds Of Main Deck. Its so easy to win. just get bad feeling as soon as you can. they will be frustrated when they pay 12 for jedi luke, and you none shall pass it.

WYS and bespin celebration Use your counter card.

the only deck that can give you problem is Old Skool Trone Room... with the farm and twix. back up the chamber fast. fight. but its not a comon deck, if you fear that deck, play no escape.


now, dont forget projective thelepathy is defencive. and you can also battle retrieve 3 and calcel it. or get around OTE.

Dont forget Control/Set for stun is huge. It can Beatdown, especialy with ZIMH. you can use it defensively like a none shall pass. you can calcel a drain. you can use to CANCEL A GIFT. also if you play against a RTP Death Star plan deck...

well thats it, I can tell you that my lost were to WYS. but now, it beat WYS... And It easily beat any other deck it will face  '
