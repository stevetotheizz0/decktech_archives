okay...like...this is the way it is  watto’s box is nasty.  SENSE is nasty to stop those pesky podracing interrupts.  maul deploying free is awesome.  undercover spies are broke when you can’t get rid of them.  transporting undercover spies to any location your opponent commits to is awesome.  if need be, then duel with stacked destiny (adding one to each with TBNMFY), and keep deploying maul, keep retrieving with rune (and keep redeploying rune from reserve with TPM).
how basic and good can you get?  alter political effects, retrieve alter and sense, alter them again.  avoid lightsabers.  lightsabers=bad.  space?  what’s that? '
