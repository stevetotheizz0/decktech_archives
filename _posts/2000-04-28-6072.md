Strategy: '

UPDATE I don't need Yarna b/c I usually don't have more than one elom in my hand at any time.

This deck is based around a little guy we all know and love-Tessek.  While he is at the AC, he adds 1 to the drains where you have a non-unique alien, yada, yada, yada.
I have Eloms in here to combat the most prominent deck types, HD and Rops, for using w/ bargaining table, to drain, and to retrieve w/ Wind Chimes.
I would replace Obi-Wan with Ben but I don't have another
I've found I have all the activation I need from my locations.
The B'omarr Monk is used with the farm for force draining.
Scramble is a must in any deck
Artoo/A Gift is very helpful vs. alien decks
Bargaining table to stop drains
Ultimatum I hate inserts
Uh-oh and Bo Shuda are for setting up Tessek safely.
Sense/Alter not enough to win a war, but will combat opponent's key effects.
Surprise Assault is a good card with a destiny average of over 3
WHAAAAAAAAAOOOOW is for combating COTVG
Skiffs are for reacting
Little starships, good for 1 turn beatdown vs. big blue
All character that aren't non-unique aliens can draw destiny by themselves.

vs HDADTJ  use those eloms and mains against those imperials.

vs Rops  I've never seen it played in my area

vs COTVG get Artoo to the chamber, A Gift

Those are the 3 major types, vs anything else I'll do whatever

Please review fast.  States tomorrow.
Tell me what to take out for what to put in.  They don't allow more than 60 cards in a tourney.
Thanx
