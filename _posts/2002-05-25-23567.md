Tournement  2-0

Respond to Garion  Ok I forgot to say that I ONLY deploy Kessel in end of the game Most of the time I use it with C3po until I tracked some high destiny. I only give 2 icon to opponent  Tatooine + docking bay 94 And if kessel is on table it is 4 not 5 .  And I think that Wys could be a choke deck vs Hunt down and Bhbm and any deck that play 2/0 location (ex hunt down with bridge + imperial holotable ) 


In general Bad Feeling hurt a lot  and the only solution I have is to hurt the opponent more with goo Ney tay.  I beat a scum deck that play bad feeling , no BArgain and the effect that my alien deploy + on tatooine it is possible.


Finaly I don?t play raider because I play beat, If I add I will add tatooine celebration, bacta thank may be Jedi luke 2 or 3 db + raider and patrol craft and yoou got a totally different deck....



----------------------------



First of all the objective of the deck is to take the control of the game with 

1- The Force Choke  

2- The evasion

3- The beat 


1- I only give 2 icons + battle plan + goo Ney Tay + Flip side + Revolution + Too close for comfort + draw Their fire= It become harder for a dark player to deploy Vader + boba an not be vulnerable for a beatdown.


2- Rebel barrier + hougix + dodge + life dept + on the edge + Combined Fleet Action + Protect your smuggler from the lost pile.


3- Deploy caracter battle that?s all. It?s fun because if han + Chewie + life dept work you win the game.


I normaly setup tatooine first with a lone ship and I try to deploy Goo Ney Tay soon has I get it or WWTBAO.


My more important problem in the deck is the activation. Because I need 8 for Chewie+han and at best I active 7 for my own (if kessel is not on table) Flip+ a ship at tatooine + Staging areas + a somebody at the docking bay). 


Revolution This card win me many game 


Combined fleet action  Opponent only draw 1 battle destiny on my site  


Strike bloked could be change for A few maneuver, Endor celebration Free & Ride , Tollon or Yott Soren depending of your Meta


Matchup


This deck is very good vs Hunt down and BHBM because of the force choke and if the play without Evader .......


MKOS could be really tough because They retrieve a lot and you not the worse is if they start the effact that made my alien deploy +1 on tatooine + dark Jedi + no bargain ....  But if your able to guard enough guy on key site (cantina, audience) you have a good chance.


Senator Tie  Never play but most be a real nightmare


Combat  Easy he run only a few different caracter = BEAT


AOBS  Tough for you, Tough for him play smart ??( I don?t any idea)


In general the deck is strong but activation could ruin a good strat. But normaly if you avtivate 10 force by turn it?s enough to win vs the majority of the deck. 

The next deck I will try will be a WYS podrace,  Scramble, on the edge, fallen portal, raider,  beggar and maybe number (artoo + luke jk+ smuggler) because the opponent cannot play 8 shield if you have idea i will be happy to read them. 


Excuse me for my bad English 

Thx for read/rate 

Kiriel
