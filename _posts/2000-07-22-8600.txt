Strategy: '

With the onslaught of Death Star II and my incoming box sometime during the next week I felt the need to wet my appetite with 7 boosters of the recently released expansion. Some great packs appeared themselves to me, with my rare cards (Luke&#8217;s Lightsaber, Darth Vader&#8217;s Lightsaber, Sim Aloo, Myn Kyneugh, B-Wing Attack Squadron, Judicator, and First Officer Thaneespi) I am still unable to make a purely Death Star II oriented deck, so I came to the conclusion that I&#8217;d make decks using a variety, however small, of the new commons and uncommons I have come into possession of.
Onto the strategy of my deck.
I use the gametext of &#8216;Squadron Assignments&#8217; to set up my starships / characters and the gametext of HB to get my systems out, I flip my objective, have fun, and whoop ass.
