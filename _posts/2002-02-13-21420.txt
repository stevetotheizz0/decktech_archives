edit # 1. the lightsaber’s are supposed to be 2 premiere sticks.people want me to add more vader,but i dont think they udnerstand i can also pull him out with blizzard 4,and it is a higher destiny.not taking out the 3 force fields.forcefield is huge,and can really save your @$$ most of the time.larger space package? do any of you know what maul’s sith infiltrater does.it is huge.it is more than enough space package.you lose 2 force to cloak everyturn,but it blocks a drain,satisfies battle order,and may even make it so they have no presense at all so you can froce drain there.armaedes was right though.very low activation,but while i have never had trouble with getting force,,i would like to find a way to fit more in.ty all for reviews




this deck mixes the best dark side charchaters with some nice high destiny’s to kill your oppenent.starting game you get your vader out asap,and then adapt to what your oppenent is doing.

some of the cards i use

sidious:he places jedi out of play.what more could i want.a 2nd one is what more i could want!!! but alas i dont own one

unsalvageable: use to cancel out of commision,and it cancels the combo card with transmission terminated also.

force field x 3:this card is huge,whenever some one trys to cut your any of your dark jedis it cancels the attempt.i use 3 so i can draw one early,and hopefully always have one.

sniper and dark strike x 2:this card can bring the beats easier than any card in the game.the coolest part is no one expects two of this card.you can use it to eliminate one of their just hit people.it can also kill spys or oppenents charachter during control phase

maul’s sith infiltrater:this card helps so much it isnt funny.my deck doesnt activate that much on its own.so battle order hurts some.all i do if i play agaisnt a deck like qmc,or wys is get maul in his ship out and cloak every turn.yes you lose two every turn,but you get free drains,and your drains are killer with sticks and presense.did i mention it is a 6 destiny and it is awesome agaisnt hidden base because you take no battle damage from security precautions,and it is immune to all attrition.

darth maul x 3:why no epp maul? simple.i think darth maul’s game text is one of the best in the game.your oppenent has no prsense unless they have ability 4.when you combine him and his infiltrater you can give alot of light side decks fits.when i use him on his ship i still cloak every turn,but he can also make it so they must pay for battle order,and can cancel celabration sometimes.plus he is immune so he is very hard to kill with the force fields and immunity.

presense of the force x 2:this card not only gives you an extra force,but it ups your force drains.agaisnt decks like wys and qmc getting the 3 drains in will really hurt them.

maul strikes x 3:this card adds destiny agaisnt qui gon,and fetches a saber,very nice if you ask me.

why do i start with no escape,and not jsut wait to get it out so i can retrieve a card.honor is big in my area,and i dont wana take the chance of not drawing an accelerate,or drawing it.so i start with it so they constantly lose to visage.

match ups

qmc:agaisnt qmc the strategy i go for is get vader down asap.if they are using the site that they can use to cancel drains,just park your vader there and own it with presense.you can now cancel their force drains with their own site.you can pretty much pay no attention to them if you own this site.get out your other troops and follow around their other people on cc.get maul in his ship out to the system asap so you can drain for free and put the presure on them even more.remember to cloak with your infiltrater every turn even if they dont have a 4 ability there because they can look through their force pile for a card every turn.if they don’t put a 4 ability there,you can drain them for 2 all game.

wys:you should get a 1st turn vader every game agaisnt wys.if you have to flip by putting him at a db,and you dont have blizzard 4,dont drain until you get in the cantina because of lost in the wilderness.sit in the cantina with vader and saber and drain 3 all game.also get a presense and some other people at either your cc docking bay or the death star docking bay.this is another match where getting maul in space is huge.you iwll probaly get drained 3 a turn at kessel all game,so why not instead get mauls ship down,and cloak(only losing 2) and fullfill battle order while losing 1 less to force loss.

lsc:usually lsc is a bad match up huntdown,but this deck has decent destiny.you will probaly lose the combats,but you shouldnt lose by more than 5.so your jedi should stay around.if you get sidious out get him to the holotheatre so he is safe.and use your dark jedi to kill off oppenents jedi.with the nice destiny is this deck you can probaly cause some nice beatdowns.

hidden base:tough match up for this deck.that is why i use security precautions.visage,and drains on the ground,with search and destroy will do some nice damage,but after they flip the base so you cant drain them anymore,make sure you get maul on his ship and go nuts probing.

profit: this deck is at its best when it is fighting people.profit will be a little weak agaisnt this deck since i have so many battle tricks.start mara,and dre combo agaisnt them,and 1st turn pull your stick out.you can them back them up with vader.with all the battle tricks it will be very hard for them to keep up with you.

throne room: this will be a tough match.they will probaly get several revos on you,and be out activating you alot.try and get presense down on their throne room,and get a vader there asap.use your battle tricks and big charachters to fight them off.they should be hard pressed to kill vader with all the force fields in here.hard match,but very winnable

senate:protect your visage,and try and set up a few drains.if they are running space try and get maul up asap to block them.vader will be a monster on the ground,and you will be able to block menace fades with mauls ship.

rst: your chachters will punish all of their little scouts.when epp’s come down force field the swings,and use i have you now to crush them. send your beat down charachters into the bunker when they go to blow it up.jsut keeping hacking and slashing,and playing destiny adders where you can.you should only lose for the race.you should be able to prevent the bunker from ever blowing up.

this deck is very strong in battles,and with alot of tricks up its sleeve.mauls ship can be your best friend in most games.blocking a drain,and fullfilling battle order.hit your oppepents charachters hard,and drain for alot with presense and sabers,and keep your visage alive.there is 2 extra visage and 4 ways to look for it.there is also an unsalvageable that cancels the combo card ooc,and transmission terminated.

this deck can handle every sitiuation,and if played right,can win any match up.ty all for reading,and please give me any help that you can.
