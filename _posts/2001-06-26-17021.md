Strategy: '

Play as a normal X-wing swarm HB deck.  Barrier anything that comes to space and beat them down; flip your objective only when necessary (the later in the game you flip, the better); use your characters to block drains and occupy for Battle Order (putting them on Tatooine after the race is huge); spread and drain in late-game.  The podrace is also a big component of the deck.  Your destiny in the deck is rather large (27 cards with destiny >3), so you should have no trouble getting a few 5s and 6s on your racer.  In the event you are pitted against a dedicated Sebulba racing deck, just use your Step Backwards and Neck And Neck to stay ahead.  I beat two dedicated Huntdown podracing decks with this (winning the race both times).  Then after the race, drop I Did It and Qui-gon at the Arena (satisfies BP and S&D) and flip.  Now you retrieve with I Did It every turn, drain for free, and cancel drains.  If your opponent can get rid of Qui-gon this late in the game, just use your Jedi Lukes to hold another site.  Play it right, and you will find that this deck is incredibly powerful in the current meta.


What about Maul?

If Darth Maul comes to space, you have a few options.  You can move an X-wing with a cannon in front of him and play Stay Sharp to blow him up.  You can deploy the Spiral with Jedi Luke pilotting (last resort).  Or you can just drain at the other systems and ignore him.  Maul can be a pain, but he is not the end of the deck.  You can still win.


What about SAC?

The chief weakness of the deck is the absence of Sense/Alter defense.  My decision was that just having SAC in your dark deck wouldnt beat me.  You would need SAC with a bunch of ships to stand a chance.  And since there are so few SAC/Space decks out there, I decided to omit SAC defense and cross my fingers.  If SAC is a big problem in your area, add a DODN&WA and pull it up with one of your Signals.


What about Monnok?

By starting Yarna, you should be okay as long as you stay under 13.  Deploy your X-wings your first few turns to the Rend. Pt. and move them to Endor as you get them.  Even a 1st-turn Alter/Monnok is not usually that bad.  But be very wary when playing against opponents decks with podracing because he can always play Podracer Collision to put a destiny back in your hand and then Monnok you, so against podracing decks, stay below 12 to be safe.


What about Security Precautions?

Once again, a meta choice.  Since so few decks pack this card these days, its usually not a worry.  But once again, it is not the end of the deck.  You can still drain and fight effectively with the cannons and the retrieval from the podrace, APTW, and I Did It will make up for the Force loss.


Why Tatooine system?

This way if you needed Luke in space (to deal with Maul), you can shuttle him down to the Arena here.  Also, you can make Qui-gon even more formidable by putting 4 or 5 wings at the system and increasing his power at the site.  Also does cool stuff with your AO...


Why the Admirals Order?

Primarily included for defense against the opponents AOs, but it also can serve other uses.  Your X-wings firing their cannons are +3 power and can redraw their weapon destinies.  Also, you can park a X-wing or two at Tatooine and make Luke immunity +2 and weapon destinies +1 (making him an even bigger fortress).


VS. HUNTDOWN PODRACING

Save your interrupts and use them wisely.  Against ANY podracing deck, never draw more than 11 cards for fear of a Podracer Collision / Monnok.  You have a strong chance of winning the race and if you do, thats pretty much game over.  Once you flip, most Huntdown decks are impotent, so flip secure and start cancelling drains.  You can use the OOC&TTs if you get them early (hopefully before your opponent draws his cancelers.  You can also put Boushh in the Executor to cancel Visage if necessary.  But your best bet is to draw Quiggy or Luke at the Arena after the race.  This way you can start up your I Did It retrieval and make your opponent lose force too.  Usually an easy game (I beat two at Ramapo).


VS. AGENTS OF BLACK SUN

Since his ships are limited to Bounty Hunter guys, your X-wing cannons are gold.  Otherwise, you should dominate after the flip and the podrace.  Drop Quiggy for S&D defense and to suspend BP after the race.  Since most AOBS decks play on docking bays, your opponent will not likely have a TatooineDB, so the Arena is a safe place to sit and hide usually.  This matchup is a no-brainer.


VS. BIG BLUE ISB

You WILL win the race (unless you suck) so use I Did It like a pro.  Wait for the right opportunities to smack his ships down (with some swarm attacks and the key Power Pivot) and hopefully you will win the game in a battle or two.  Otherwise use your evasive interrupts to play cat-and-mouse with the big ships and you should do pretty well.


VS. ALIENS (COURT, MKOS, ETC.)

Definately your toughest match-up.  Once Hutt Influence comes down, your deck is suffering.  Once you win the race, use your characters wisely to disrupt the opponent and drain as much as you can.  Rebel Fleet is gold. And if your opponent decides to come to space, you win.  Play smart and you should do OK.


VS. TIES

X-wing cannon wins this game almost every time.  Move a few X-wings to Wakeelmui if you are falling behind to increase the TIE deploy costs.  And dont forget that your X-wings can swarm out just like his TIEs so use your battle evasion tactics wisely and hit him in a battle or two if possible.  Your deck is advantaged against this match-up.


VS. DARKDEAL JUNK

Keep him from flipping by controlling Bespin so you can cancel his drains with your objective.  Take over Bespin and the cloud sector and drain like a pro as quickly as you can.  Your force retrieval will help tremendously in this game.  Also, you probably dont want Luke or Qui-gon on Cloud City (fearing a beatdown) but putting them there late-game could be very helpful.  Just play smart and you should do well.


VS. BHBM

Since BHBM decks are usually pretty basic and lack original tech, you should do well.  Use Luke for hit-and-runs as necessary and feed him to Vader when the time comes.  Qui-gon is gold in this game because you will likely need someone for Battle Plan to keep your X-wing drains going.  Usually an auto-win.


This deck is very solid and can handle most match-ups with ease.  It went undefeated at Ramapo (timing once to Bastian) and when played right is one of the best meta decisions in the current environment.  Good luck with it
