Strategy: '

Why no Palpy?

Well Palpy isn`t that usefull in this deck and better cards can ve put in instead of doing like other decks and puttin in Palpy x3, vader x3 and such. Just use those characters to beat your opponent if He comes to the DS Docking Bay. When he does, just capture, kill and torture his characters. 

Deploy about 3-4 TIE’s at each system with a Dreadnaught to transport them around. Then just sit back and enjoy the beat down. 

more strategy will come soon after I do more testing of this deck at local tournaments.  '
