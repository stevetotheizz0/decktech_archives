Ok, i know what you guys are thinking, most of this deck isnt released yet.  This is how i think the deck should go.  ANyway, you start with the coolest tat site out right now and you’ll probably get maul in your opening hand if not within your first draw phase.  If your opponent is playing podracing this is perfect.  Mostly everyone will put padme in their deck to start off.  If they dont then the drains are still decent.  The medium destiny in here is 3-5 which is bad for dueling. Ground power isnt a problem and space isnt that bad either.  I dont know what the sith probe droids do but they must help this deck theme some. I hope you enjoy this pre release title.
