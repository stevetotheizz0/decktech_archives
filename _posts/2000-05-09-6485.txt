Strategy: '

Listen up, knuckle heads.	I post this deck for the little people out there who ask (occasionally, though it is) for a list of cards I put in my winning decks.  Here's one.  Guess what?  It probably looks very similar to the decks you play with.  I've got locations, characters, starships, interrupts, effects.  I make them work for me.  Try playing more than one game a week with your 4 year old sister and you might find your skills will improve to the point that the cards included in this deck make sense.  Try playing games back.  Same decks, same players.  If your excuse is that you can't see how you can possibly beat an (insert deck x) deck with an (insert deck y) deck, then change your goddam deck and play it up. What can you do to beat deck x?  Think of something and put it in  Then play it again.  THAT'S HOW THIS DECK WAS MADE.

Then once you're finished creating the ultimate deck, make something to beat it and start all over again.

All you crybabies out there who think you're gowd's gift to star wars with a 1450 rating, send your 1/2 star reveiw someplace else.

Death Star is based losely on a deck first given to me by Brian Fred.	 '
