Strategy: '

Here is a cut at Brentson's Beatdown. I posted a version of this before but someone gave it a half star for its third review and I figured no-one will look at it again. I tooks some of the suggestions made by the other reviewers. I did not put in Yoxgit and the Landing Claws because this deck is about attacking, not hiding. Please let me know what you think.
Normally, start Draw Their Fire. Against Ops start Battle Plan.
It's pretty standard fare. Play your recycling destiny 5 cards. Use Descent Into the Dark to immediately recycle the force you pay to deploy back into your reserve deck. This gives you plenty of cards to draw for multiple destinies. Your only
dueling protection is your high destiny and one Courage of a Skywalker. So you have to be patient if dueling is a possibility. Draw until you get what you need and beat them down. You need a Tatooine site for Beggar. So there is one Frozen Assets in there in case you can't get one when you need it. With all of the Big Blue out there now, Star Destroyer seems like a good choice. Mechanical Failure also looks good against the
current meta. It's kind of vulnerable to 3720 to 1 so, if they are popular in your area, switch out a Bith Shuffle or an Out of Commision for Don't Forget The Droids -- it's a better destiny anyway, just not as easy to recycle.	'
