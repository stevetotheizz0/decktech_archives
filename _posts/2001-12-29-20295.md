Strategy: '

Obviousley the strategy here is pretty simple, drain and battle... Believe it or not Jar-Jar is a HUGE help here. He can deploy anywhere to start good drains, is part fo of one of the few battle destiyn combos in EP1 format, and can take out almost any

e of the pesky droids, that almost always show up in the darksides deck. The reason we(my freend and I) decided to play this objective is that Controls and Master Droidekas are not too uncommon in this format and getting drains established is essential.

e aslo decided to use Padme for her ability to pull two Jedi. Energy walls can also be a game winner if the oppenent decides after a battle he doesn&#8217;t wanna leave. There are various high destiny interuppts in the mix to add a little edge here and there,

nd to use as combat cards.


No Money This deck is a potnent deck in this format but are deck usually comes out victorious(even against our version of it). It is a matter of making the other person focus on coming to you. He&#8217;ll usually try to come to you to stop the drains which w

l leave him a bit exposed. The only thing you really need to watch for is that you don&#8217;t hold Watto&#8217;s Junkyard without some power because when he plops down Watto it can hurt.


We&#8217;ll Let Them Make The First Move Essentially the same deck, things get interesting here. The opponent has the upper hand with interuppts, but your numbers we&#8217;ll hopefully subdue him in the long run. Armanent Dismantled is a lifesaver in a pinch and D

th Maul&#8217;s Demise will hopefully hurt him, if Qui-Gons out of play...


Other decks we see are usually just beat down decks with some random starting site, in which you have to use you instincts...


Cards we thought about adding The Camp, Another Qui-Gons Saber, Another Obi&#8217;s Saber, Another Sense.


Cards we thought about removing Alter(not many effect are played in this format), Senator Stuff...


Thanks for any help ahead of time. '
