Strategy: '

This deck started out as a fun deck, but it really works AND is fun to play AND is not too mainstream.


STRATEGY

Start Agents, A-Chamber, FOIL Paploo.  Laugh at your opponent while he tries to figure out what you&#8217;re doing.  Heading for the Medical Frigate means you get Uh-Oh Insurrection Strike Planning

While your opponent activates, announce strike planning to pull General Crix Madine.

You activate 5+ whatever he gives you.  Pull Bo Shuda, and look for Tessek.  If he&#8217;s in the force pile, draw.  If you feel lucky deploy Crix at the Endor Docking Bay (which you pulled) OR do this if you have NINE force and can deploy Chewie from your reserve deck anyway.

Either way, you can pull Chewie next turn and drop him.

When Chewie&#8217;s on table, use his text to pull Lumat and or Wuta.  Wuta&#8217;s the important one, and you pack two.  Once he&#8217;s down, use force, to pull the Back Door.  This site is Untouchable.  And a drain of 4.  


This should be the 4th turn or so. 


Get Tessek at this chamber, and throw an Ithorian at each Endor site.  Alone is okay.  That&#8217;s pretty much only gonna be the Hidden Forest Trail, Ewok Village, and Back Door.  Save the Great Forests for after the drop so they can&#8217;t spread like your scouts can.  Lone Ithorian means your drains are plus TWO.  One for adding an Icon, and one for Tessek.  Means you start draining for ten.  You occupy three battlegrounds, and one with Lumat/Wuta means you flip.  Use Ewoks to 1. Block Drains and 2. lose them and retrieve them.  Retrieve one force every turn, and eventually, retrieve a lot for Nar Shadda.

You can kill Dark Endor Decks, too.


In Case you&#8217;ve never heard of these
