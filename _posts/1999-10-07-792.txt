Objective:
ISB Operations/Empire's Sinister Agents



Strategy: 

I may have been lucky to win with it, but its speed & damage potential are nothing to sneeze at. Depending on your opponent's starting cards, select:
Security Precautions (hidden base, revolver/force choke)
A Bright Center (ops decks)
Den of Thieves (careful of SAC)

Drop & drain your operatives & flip quickly.  Deploy Vader ASAP & SAC your opponent's interrupts & effects.  The starships are for probing or to battle average opposing space power.	Multiple ORS can soak attrition as pilots/passengers with Jabba in the audience chamber.  *DO NOT* forget to retrieve an ISB agent during each of your draw phases.  I will admit I have forgotten in the past--it is simple, yet could make the difference in the end game.

Wounded Wookie is underrated vs EPP beatdown.  It has been successfully used to negate EPP weapons, or other rebel gametext when an ORS is involved in same battle.  Don't forget the other text--can limit opponent to drawing 2 battle destiny, or cancel Clash of Sabers.

Increased Alters are to cancel effects like Bacta Tank, Frozen Assets, etc.  The destinies are low, which may not help you in battle, but may help you with SAC draws, even with +4 from MWYHL.  Sensing Grimtaash, alters, Nar Shadda Wind Chimes, etc, may not mean much but every card counts!  Enjoy!
