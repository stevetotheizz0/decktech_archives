Strategy: '

General Strategy
You start Hidden base first turn get either corascant or kessel and deploy a docking bay there
do the same next turn.try to get people to the docking bays so you can activate lot’s of force.When it is all set up tou should have a good hold on corascant and kessel plus there docking bays with ill’ take the leader out and hidden base fipped [witch is why the other systems are in here nobody in my area plays security precations] you will be draining for at least 10 [12 if you have sabers].If they try to come beat you up use fallen portal and kill there characters.
