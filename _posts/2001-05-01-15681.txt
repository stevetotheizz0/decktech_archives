Strategy: '

Basic TIGIH Scouts deck. BY turn 1 you have 5 activation from just you. Pull Crix and deploy ad pull Wuta and deploy. Wuta pulls sites, Crix pulls people. Simple as that. I don’t have much strategy because it hasn’t been playtested yet, I’m getting ther.

--Against AOBS- Give luke to Emperor and let em have the 2 a turn direct loss.

--Against MKOS- If Mara there, give to her. If not, go in a beat down with Leia and Han.
