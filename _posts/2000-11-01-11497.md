Strategy: '

Use Docking Bay generation.
Use Fallen Portals to protect yourself.
Grab Sense w/ Grappling hook, then Control.
Use Obi-wan’s "move away" to kill low ability
aliens/imperials.

Use whatever Luke will work best for the job.

As you beatdown on your opponent, remember to
make him stack cards on conflict.
Then when fighting Vader voulantairily kill Luke,
Anakin, and have Vader fighting for your side.
If they are dueling Luke, play NOOOO to make him
lost, then convert.

Twilight lets you get Force is Strong (to kill
Empy) or Anakin. Also cancles YAB.

Direct damage is there to deal with space.

Grab just about anything.

Against

BHBM
Wait until he succeeds in crossing Luke.
Play NOOOOO and Anakin Skywalker to turn the
game in your favor.

Hunt Down
Let him duel Luke, keep Obi out of it.
When he duels Luke, win or loose you win, because
Vader will either be dead or Anakin.

Court.
You are there. Beat him down with ben, luke, elom
Lando is very good.

Space.
Drain race, your DD + Sabers against him.
You have Barganing table.

Note opponent cannot retrieve force on Conflict,
should hurt annoying scum decks.

comments are always welcome
