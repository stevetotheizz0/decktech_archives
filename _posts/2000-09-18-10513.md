Strategy: '

This Deck is rather good. It uses the x wings and speeders to help you win battles and some retrieval. You should start by pulling the docking bays and then getting out incom corporation and maneuvering flaps. you should then set up some speeders at docking bays for activation and maybe luke at the endor docking bay. the spies are in there to cancel whatever drains opponent has and the extra luke is their for the obvious reasons. then set up your x wings at kessel or deploy them and battle. you should do the same with the speeders. Now on to the matchups.

Vs. Huntdown
Get out honor as fast as possible. then when he deploys vader wreck him with the speeders. if he goes to the hut, deploy boushh there to stop his drains.

vs. bhbm
hard game. set up speeders at docking bays and force drain. win some battles and try to turn vader. this will be tough.

vs. ties
spread out on the ground and drain. then send your x wings up to destroy his ties.

that is the only popular matchups around now adays. i dont really need sac because no one plays it in my area, as well as monnok. this is a great variation of this deck and it works like a machine. i hope you like it and will give me any help on what i should add. thanks
