Strategy: '

Start the game by drawing 8 cards. Get a good amount of power to Tosche as soon as you can for easy activation. In the meantime, draw up cards and play interrupts as necessary. Get out Traffic Control early to help recycle and track all the fives and sixes for battle destinies and weapon destinies. The basic strategy is just to activate a lot, beat down a lot... the interrupts help both offensively and defensively. Here's how to play against specific deck types

Vs. Hunt Down Draw until you get a Transimission Terminated to cancel Visage. If it takes to long to find one, you can always use Boushh to deploy directly there. Beat down as necessary.

Vs. Hunt Down dueling Duel protection is Glancing Blow to cancel one of their destinies and Run Luke Run to directly cancel Vader's Obsession and I've never seen a deck run more than 2. The destinies are pretty good so you should hold up in a duel well.

Vs. ISB If they play the non-interactive ISB, just get Draw Their Fire and Frozen Assets/Beggar and beatdown lone characters. Ultimatum should minimize most drains

Vs. Dark Deal Get guys to CC FAST If you can't get EPP Luke and Obi out, nabrun Ben and Master to CC. The idea here is to stop their operations fast because when they flip, it hurts.

Vs. Court of the Gangsta Pick your battle carefully. Get traffic control out to recycly high destinies that will help to rid the table of pesky bounty hunters. DTF and Beggar will keep Hidden Weapons out of your face. Once you get rid of most of the major BHers, you will have main control of the table and you can drain and battle to victory from there. Use Put That Down to help stop those pesky BH weapons.

Vs. Space Using Landing Claw to cancel one drain in space. Set up some drains on the ground. Pile up a bunch of mains on a ship and fly it around kicking butt and taking names.
