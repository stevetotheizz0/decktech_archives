Strategy: 

ok this is fun. it should beat profit, but i've tweaked it so it can beat other junk too.
start tatooine and combat readiness for jabbas hut, then turn 1 pull the audience chamber.(note: if he starts obis hut vs you plan for catina, since he will convert the palace)
basically get guys down, drain,occupation, search n destroy, win.

profit-ok i wont waste a lot of time explaining profit defense. basically convert their locations, get guys down, sac inerrupts/effects, mabey ETE on the AC to get guys out fast. dannik is huge here, as is circle.

EBO-ahh yes, the greatest thing since sliced bread, the beloved ebo. do your normal start. fish out resistance fast (the reason for 3 twileks). put 3 characters at sites, moment of triumph helps clear out beatdown crews if you are forced to spread thin. get ETE on a drain +1 site.
use your drains of 2, sabers/ete, search and destroy, and resistance to beat them. it wont be easy at all but is possible to win vs ebo.control the early drains while u get set up.

hbx-not to be cocky, but this deck kills hbx. precautions, s and d, drains, probe, win.

obis hutt start-ok you get the catina of the palace w/combat readiness so they cant convert palace. they will drop a lot of guys on u, but dont worry. lots of removal and neat stuff 2 do w/iggy,4lom, dannik,disarmed,evanan/sabers, malar,
dlots, circle,ect. play smart & cautions, and you will win.

TRM- ok basically same as tosche, but you start normal. if they put a guy @ palace turn 1 dont worry, save a turn or 2 and slaughter 'em. not easy game but you can pull it out.

mega falcon-control their drains while you can, set up your junk, avoid space, win.

ok most of you can tell how to beat other decks, i gave strategys vs the main ones.

cards that make this deck fly-
control: sac AND drain protection. great card
moment of triumph: ability 4 guy gets 2 destiny
ETE: use it to enhance drains or get guys out fast
circle/dannik:its BAD when ls guys go POOP( placed out of play)

ok questions/comments/suggestions d-mail me before reviewing so i can clear up concerns about possible weaknesses before u review it.

build it, try it, have fun
