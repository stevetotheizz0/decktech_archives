Strategy: '

Get Yoda and DOS to Training Area with Jedi Tests #1 and #2. Complete them on next turn. Get Jungle, Swamp, Yoda’s Hut, and JTs #3-6 on subsequent turns. Complete 3 & 4 and get Traffic Control out with #4. Activate as much force as you can each turn and draw it all until you get all three R2-D2 In Red 5 in your hand. Put all but those three in used pile with Traffic Control. Activate all of your force until your Reserve deck is empty. Begin #5 and place the 3 R2D2IR5 in used pile. After completing #5, deploy #6 and return DOS to hand and redeploy to Dagobah. Then use #4 and Traffic Control to get the Characters you need and either go to Naboo for big force drains or to where the Dark Side is for big battle damage for them. '
