Strategy: 

Start out with IAO and get out the DB.  This'll at least give you one site, if one hasn't come up in the opening hand.  Getting some ISB agents shouldnt be too much of a problem.	After you get 4, deploy and flip ISB ops.  As you get locations, put them down and get ISB agents there.  Get as many drains there as possible without spreading out too much.	If you see antidueling stuff, like Courage of A Skywalker, or Glancing Blow go to the Lost Pile to drains, you have a good shot of pulling off one of the duels.  Even if the targets (Luke and Obi) are somewhere out there where you dont get force icons, you can still deploy an ISB agent there first (theyre all spies) deploy a Vader, duel.  Epic Duel isnt importatnt, so I didnt include it, besides, it's a tip-off to dueling.  If Dark Deal can be set up, do it.  Otherwise, Just keep draining and the deck should be able to well.
