Strategy: 

Stratagy:
An average Tie Intercepter deck. Use tie intercepters to retrieve and overpower the opponent into a wimpy little baby. Use the cannons to shoot everything in the sky down to the lost pile. Use battle deployment to screw anyone who doesnt play with capitols. Commander  Brandei pulls ties while on a star destroyer. All of the rest is self explanitory. If you do have any questions just drop me a line. Please also keep in mind that this is my first dark deck on decktech so try to go easy.
