Strategy: '

To start the game, during the opponents turn, pull your two generals. I usually pull MADINE and CALRISSIAN, but you can pull whoever you want.  First Turn i usually drop Madine at the docking bay, and pull a scout to help protect him (usually Kansaric).  As soon as i get Nien Nunb and a planet, i pull Gold Squadron 1 and set em there (usually dont do it until you have PUNCH IT.  4 destinies is always nice ).


The systems are pretty obvious, Kessel and Coruscant drain for 3, plus Coruscants game text just rules. If you have Kensaric at a site, then Imperials deploy +4 to that site 

Also, last game, i was lucky enough to get Coruscant in my starting hand against Hunt Down, he couldnt afford to deploy and i mauled him with a 21 card differential


I Play with I Know and Life Debt, so i need Whos Scruffy Looking? to protect those. 


Card Combos 

Leave Tycho Celchu on his Ship with Wedge on his ship at Kiffex. Thats a deploy of 7, with a forfeit of 20, power 14 and you can cancel the opponents battle destiny. 


General Calrissian + Nien Nunb + Gold Squadron 1 + Punch It(let them Initiate Battle) = Power 8 and 4 battle destinies 


Home 1 + Ackbar + F.O. Thaneespi = Power 15, Immune to attrotion <12, and opponent needs 6 ability. AWESOME


MATCHUPS 


VS. Hunt Down - Try to keep Luke at the hut to drain and wait for them to come to you. Get Blount or Cracken to the Holotheatre to cancel Visage. Keep space held and the back door and you will be draining so heavily that they cant survive. 


VS. My Kind of Scum - Against this deck, it would be safer for you to just stick with your own plan, Get to space and begin to drain, also get to your sites and drain with midge, usually mKOS cannot handle this


VS. Yavin 4 Occupation (organas neclace, Rebel base Occupation, SFS) - This deck is VERY big in my area, so far all i can do when i see it is one thing CRY usually its game over for me, the only thing i can protect against is the RBO, cuz of Endor Celebration. Could someone give me advise on ways to beat this
