Strategy: '

Differences between this version and the earlier one

obviously, i decided to start heading for the medical frigate ’cos even tho’ you may not be able to set up as quickly as before, you get a much more stable start against most decks.  3 signals and 2 ansbs should let you get one early.	even if you don’t, deploy your locations, drop i@#$%ibs at safe locations, and look for them.  the two projections helps against rops and court.	battle plan helps tremendously because the opponent will almost never try to go to space.  planet farthest from helps stop ops and overseeing it personally.  Bith Shuffle stops those decks that set for stun han, overload leia, or gravity shadow the falcon by stopping them from tracking destiny.

other than that, read my strategy for the original deck.
