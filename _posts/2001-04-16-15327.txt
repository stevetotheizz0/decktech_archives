Strategy: 

Well, this deck doesn’t have 2 objectives, but it uses the biggest part of TDIGWATT, Dark Deal.  I’ll take this strategy by turn, because I think it will be explained better:

Turn 1:  Deploy Cloud City: East Platform from reserve deck.  If you don’t see Dark Deal or Bespin: Cloud City in the reserve deck, then draw up your force pile.  If you do see them, then save the force, or deploy a few characters to the East Platform to get more activation next turn.  End turn.

Turn 2:  Drain if you can.  Deploy Audience Chamber (if you don’t think you can support characters at the Docking Bay 94), or Docking Bay 94 if you can support it for more activation.  Again, if you don’t see Bespin: Cloud City or Dark Deal, then draw them up.  If not, then turn, deploy Lando from the reserve deck, along with a CC Trooper or 2, or a stronger character.  Move frozen Han to the docking bay.

Turn 3:  Remember to force drain.  Deploy the other Tatooine site.  Keep Han moving with more backup characters so he does not get rescued.

Turn 4:  Use a card to look through your deck and see if Dark Deal or Bespin is in there.  If they aren’t, only move the ice cube into the Audience Chamber.  If they’re there, then deploy away and move him.

Turn 5:  Now you can have some fun.  Now that the objective is flipped, you can deploy Dark Deal!  Deploy Cloud City, 1 starship there, and Dark Deal.  Land the starfighter if you fear beatdowns.  Back up the sites with characters.  Smile at your opponent.  Get Scum and Villany out.

Turn 6:  Drain up!  You can even drain 2 at Security Tower.  Retrieve your force.  Battle him at weak spots.  Retrieve more.  Remember your aliens are immune to attrition <4.



There you have it.  All 3 sites are out quickly, control them, and Cloud City, and you’re set.  Use Vader w/ Saber for a quick beatdown where he has 2 characters (whack one, lose the other to attrition).  If the opponent has Menace Fades out, then make sure he can’t control a system.  This is why I have a Boba Fett in space instead of ground.  If s/he’s holding 1 planet, then deploy all ships you have to there.  Make sure they don’t control it!  Other than this card (and Great Warrior), you shouldn’t have much of a problem.  You have plenty of beatdown power.  Use trooper assault as much as possible (I LOVE THAT CARD), and destroy the Super Falcon with Dengar in Punishing One and Guri in the Stinger.  It’s really good.  Anyways, play this deck and have fun.  By the way, don’t worry if they rescue Han.  The objective isn’t very necessary after it’s flipped.  Dark Deal does the rest.
