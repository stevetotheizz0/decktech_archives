Strategy: '

Basically, take over Hoth and use RBO and Walker Garrison to hurt your 
           opponent when they try to take it back. Use CHYBC to prevent drains on 
           Hoth from your opponent against EBO. 

Use Danik to take key characters out of play for your opponent.

Everything else is straightforward

Matchups
EBO  Overpower them in space, overpower them on the ground
HB  Keep your fleet together and systematically probe after they flip.
TIGIH  Stay away from Luke.  Get someone to the Landing platform, though, to cancel generation.

Those are the only major archtypes here, but just play smart for the others. '
