Use Danik to take key characters out of play for your opponent.

Everything else is straightforward

Matchups:
EBO:  Overpower them in space, overpower them on the ground
HB:  Keep your fleet together and systematically probe after they flip.
TIGIH:  Stay away from Luke.  Get someone to the Landing platform, though, to cancel generation.

Those are the only major archtypes here, but just play smart for the others.
