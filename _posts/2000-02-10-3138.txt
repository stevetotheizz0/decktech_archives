Strategy: 

	This deck is realy simple. It uses Walkers and Ships to create HUGH power to beat the light side down. The deck can be very fast (ex: dreadnuaght and a guy first or second turn then a walker and a guy on endor 3rd turn = drain for 6), or the deck can be played slow to beat the light side down (ex: save your walker till he deploys then SMACK). The desitnys in the deck are really low but there is not much take be down for that. The deck over all runs good with a lose to a realy strong light side.
