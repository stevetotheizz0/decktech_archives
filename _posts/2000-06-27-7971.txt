Strategy: '

okay, the way the deck wins is by popping palpatine out onto ralltir and protecting him with guards, then using Overseeing it personally to get FD +1 at all your sites.  use blizzards to move more pikes to defend with/forfeit, and recycle them/pay 2 to get them again.  once per game to retrieve.  other than this, there's built in #s protection with ALL 3's and 6's for characters.  it'll be fun.  start decree+inconsequential losses+whatever else.'
