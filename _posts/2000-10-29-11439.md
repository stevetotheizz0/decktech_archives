Strategy: '

ok......simple ......get merrejk out(he is a cmdr so piett can get him.....imp command can get piett) ......try & put him at dantooine because you can react there....& he will be safe from getting killed.....aslo get chiraneau once your systems are out& start draining with big punch....also get janust doing the recicle thing & make sure you put your high destiny in your deck & track hem well(if you can)
also put the fear of monnock in them  from the start & play it only when you are going to get something out of it(used or lost)
lateral damage is for that pesky canadian falcon.......or the homeone
have fun raping asses with this one & make sure vader gets his fun
