---------Responses to stupid reviews---------
Sence or Alter will eat you for breakfast. Throw in a Do Or Do Not and a Wise advice. Otherwise it looks ok to me.

Okay, I start with Wise Advice so what’re you talking about?
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is the first revision of this deck. Yoxgit is the rep. It lets you start a immune to Alter Yarna to set up X-wing swarm. You pull Echo Docking Bay, deploy a droid there, and start playing How Did We Get Into This Mess? to cycle through your deck. You get out a lone X-wing to either Kessel or Kiffex and when they get you play Hyper Escape, Rebel Barrier, or Houjix. On your turn you would deploy Incom Corporation and deploy several X-wings and kill off your opponent. It can also shut down your opponent’s drains on the ground with Boussh and 2 Undercovers. You can also use Bargaining Table and Rebel Fleet. Aim High is for TIE decks and X-wing Laser Cannons are awesome vs bounty hunter ships.

I might throw in Projection of a Skywalker, more X-wings, It’s a Hit, It Could Be Worse, Legendary Starfighter, or Nar Shaddaa Wind Chimes. Tell me if any of these should go in.
