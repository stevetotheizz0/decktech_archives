Strategy: '



Ok so you start HFTMF and Pull Staging Areas, Insurrection and Your Insight Serves You Well.

 First turn, first of all search for a docking bay first to make sure you’ll be able to find Dagobah and the Hut, so you don’t have to worry about having to let them varify.

 So you pull Home One Docking bay if you can Dagobah and the Hut. If you get a Docking Bay and Ackbar in your hand you’ll be getting atleast 12 force second turn unless Thespanni or the Echo DB isn’t in your reserve.


 From there you’ll want to get CC Lower Coridor out and drain in there and hold the Docking Bay as well if you can.


 Now for what to do against certain decks.


 Ral Ops
 You have two options either go to them and try to get to Raltiir with the Home One (if they use Rendilli with Mob Points then you can otherwise stick one of the spy pilots on the falcon then set yourself up there) Now if you get to the system your set drop your people from the ship down to Raltiir and then work from there. Or you can just let them be and try to outdrain them, your retrieval should be enough to keep you alive.

HDADTJ
They will come to you so play it out as you would setting up your activation and drains and let them come to you. Pull out Honour of the jedi as well.

BHBM

Same deal as with hunt down, as well try to avoid battling unless you know you can win. Use both On and Off The Edge to keep you afloat. You’ll eventually have to give Luke to Vader so once it gets to the point where he’s about to be Turned (if that happens) use NOOOOOOOOO and making them have to go after Luke again will turn the game in your favour unless it’s going good for you already (or the situation is hopeless;p)


 So that’s pretty much it hopefully it will work for you like it has for me
