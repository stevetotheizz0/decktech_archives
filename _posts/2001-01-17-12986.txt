Strategy: 

this deck is all about DEATH!  fun stuff and just about ALL kinds of dueling.  you can portents bomb them, you can duel away their guys, and you can beef up your okuras so they cannot defend (which is your terrain defense as well).  use blacked claws, evil portents, egg of pan ku, and for the empire to beef up the okuras, and you win.  blah
