description: This deck has only lost once against a force d-deck and is very capable of batteling both land and space away. With Gallid you can set up very powerfull drains at Jabba's Palace, and Abyssins are a true recurring nightmare for your opponent!!!

Strategy: 

You start Jabba's Palace + JP audience ch. using combat readiness. Then you start pulling those sites AND those aliens.
Myo can make your Abyssins power 4 each :)
Galid is a very solid drain guy.
Jabba is simply cool: activate +1 each time you drain with an alien, and makes them forfeit +1
you battel 'em away with abbysins and you revive them. that's not difficult because you have massive activation!
everything you draw, you can deploy, so you don't need reactor terminals. This deck can battle Operatives without difficulties, and has strong anti hidden base and MWYHL defense. It works! try it and be amazed.

Notice : You can throw in None shall pass if you find it necessairy.
 OOPS : Nalan Cheel should be Chal Beckan!
