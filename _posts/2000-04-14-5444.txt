Strategy: '

You start Jabba's Palace + JP audience ch. using combat readiness. Then you start pulling those sites AND those aliens.
Myo can make your Abyssins power 4 each )
Galid is a very solid drain guy.
Jabba is simply cool activate +1 each time you drain with an alien, and makes them forfeit +1
you battel 'em away with abbysins and you revive them. that's not difficult because you have massive activation
everything you draw, you can deploy, so you don't need reactor terminals. This deck can battle Operatives without difficulties, and has strong anti hidden base and MWYHL defense. It works try it and be amazed.

Notice  You can throw in None shall pass if you find it necessairy.
 OOPS  Nalan Cheel should be Chal Beckan '
