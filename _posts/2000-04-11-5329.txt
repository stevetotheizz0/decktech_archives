Strategy: '

Changes to the deck I'm pulling out Omni Box
and It's Worse.  In is going Search and Destroy
and Ability Ability Ability.
I'm also gonna try to make room for a main course..

Start Bad Feeling have I, unless you're scared
of the massive Revo deck, then start Crush the Rebellion.

SAC protection not really needed, only sense protection.
The only things they can S/A are bad feeling have i, reacts,
and alter.  Alter plus Push on there sense wins you that
war, espescially if oppresive enforcement is out.

There are a couple of differences from other AT-ST
Rops decks.  No tramples  how about that.  Reasons
1  I dont' have any )
Reason 2 They're not reliable enough for the way
I play this deck.  When i hit my opponent, i want
to hit him, not go 'oh please smush him'.  They're
great for Bothan Spies, but not really great for
mains.	Deck is chock full of 3, and you need a 4.
So in goes Bubo for spy defense, he can be pulled
with the swamp too which is an added bonus.  He's
also a GREAT Nudj killer, espescially if you can
convert there swamp first turn.
Pol Treidum was a personal choice, Spies are
popular enough in Kamloops to warrant him.  Never
used him at the provincials, If i take this to
a Grand Slam or Continental, i'll probably scrap
him for a main course.
More Characters than most Ralops decks, this makes
it more reliable.  There have been SOO many games
i should've lost, but the extra characters just
let me outlast em.  Check out my Vancouver Tourney
Report, Game 4 vs David Houle.	Without that extra
power, i was gone.
This also me to spread out and beat them down in
more spots after the flip.  Tempest Scout1+Arnet,
Tempest Scout2+watts+marquand, Mara, Vader (with
or without Tarkn), Ig-88, Tempest 1 + Igar, and then
add in whoever else is handy such as evax, cabbel,
ds-61-2 (all preferably helping piloting or in there
own walker) and you can take out quite alot.

Space	My space compliment is perfect.  All
have some form of immunity, which is the big
kicker against hidden base.  just throw up an
at-st pilot on the big E, or evax or some other
shmuck and you got destiny.  Heck why even bother
searching for there hidden base, convert coruscant,
probe kiffex, kessel, and throw Boba and Executor,
one at each.  until they get rid of boba, they have
no drains.

Vs Throne Room
Haven't lost to it yet.  The extra power is what
pulls me through, i can still cause alot of damage
without the flip.  Go for the flip if you can,
beat them down where it's too your advantage,
and try to get that drain at kashyyyk and you'll
do fine.

Vs Profit
I learned this the hard way.  Do NOT deploy what
would normally be a good force early on to Tatooine.
that Free Master Luke is gonna cause some hurt.
get Ralltir set up, then try to pound em into the ground.
Drain at kashyyyk, and remember, your AT-ST's aren't
limited to reacting around Ralltir, they can do
it on Tatooine too (cept #3).

Numbers
at-st pilots and vesden.  Nuff said.

Speeders
The extra power should help out here, they'll send
a giant beatdown squad at you, and you should
be able to take it.  Then beat em back, or run
away until you can.  Drain at Kashyyyk (damn i
say that alot).

Harvest
Push cards and beatings, plus your constant drains.


I am seriously scared of this deck.  Mechanical
Failure and Romas Lock can hurt, but even then
it's got the power that allows you to take it.
