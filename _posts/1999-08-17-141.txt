title: Another Tatooine Deck...
side: Dark
date: 1999-08-17
description: It's not a huge thought deck.  Just use CombatReadiness to start Tatooine and Jabba's Palace.  The deck has loads of power and is not very hurt by Revolver.  It has obvious weaknesses, but it's generally strong.
rating: 4.5

Strategy: 

The Deck starts with the System and Tatooine: Jabba's Palace.  Then Get the Audience Chamber first turn.  Two of your three sites on the Table are immune to Revolution.
Then just drop characters to drain with the Ships at the system to hold it while you get off Occupation.  Resistance is protectiom against inserts.  The SCrews with M'iiyoom Onith can keep oposition away.
Some bits of Tech:  Expecting 'Quite A Mercenary'?  Deploy Datcha and use their force.  ALso good against reacts and other nasty things.
Dannik can 'soup' up characters Choked by DLOTS.
All the ships are ability two or higher.
Other than that, just dominate the planet.
