Strategy: '

CARD CHANGE There are 63 cards in this deck, I am removing M'iiyoom onith, and 2 Scanning crews.I dont have a lot of time to type, tornado coming. But here is the main strat. Get all the exterior drain two sites in a row with each other. Put the AT-STs in them, use Expand The Empire to make drains more. IF they come to fight react and deploy a lot. Well theres the thunder. C ya  '
