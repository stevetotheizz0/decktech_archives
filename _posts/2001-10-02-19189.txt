edit This is a Closed Environment Decjk so I don&#8217;t want any reveiws Like "WTF no Vader??" 

Alright. First Turn Fart on Ani&#8217;s PodFlip if you can (most of the time you can). 

Against almost EVERY match up I start the Box, but against some players/decks I start begin landing of TPM.

Drop maul and he&#8217;s a god with The phantom MEnace out. 

If I had them I would put a third Phantom menace in and a 4th MAul strikes. Just Cuz I could. 

Why 2 Porn Frees Cuz he&#8217;s great to drop with maul to add a destiny 

Against Hyperdrive, Drop maul into the shop since he&#8217;s immune to attrition. 

Against Senators Hodl the senate, Adding Battle Destinies when you can. LS Senators is much weaker than DS. 

Pretty Simple. REad the cards adn you can paly the deck. This deck can be palyed by a trained Monkey (Why yes my brother HAS played this deck.)  

This deck RoX da race With 4 (in some tournies I paly 5) Collisions + SAC sebulba is almost unbeatable (cept by my Light Deck) '
