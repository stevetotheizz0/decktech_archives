Strategy: 

This is just a fun deck I made. You use B-wing bombers and weapons for retrieval and some beatdown. Raltiir guys draw by themselves which is good. I took the best 3 unique X-wings so they could use X-wing Cannons against bounter hunter ships. The Adrimal Order helps keep them alive and hurts Ties. Basically, I pull Raltiir on turn 1. Then I pull Aquaris for activation. Then Roche, Kiffex,and Kessel last. Put a B-wing to every system with a Raltiir Freighter Captain in them. Use Rapid Fire and Slight Weapons Malfunction to surprise your opponent. Barrier, Hyper Escape, and Hit and Run all help to prevent beatdowns against you. Do not rate harsly, this is just a fun deck that I use sometimes.
