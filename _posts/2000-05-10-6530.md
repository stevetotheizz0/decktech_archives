Strategy: '

The object of the deck is to get out artoo, 8D8, and wioslea on a starship.  Then play never tell me the odds.  They can lose a ton of force.  If they play resistance, go to the usuall hidden base strategy, playing ships and characters in the ground.  This deck has enough power to beatdown in space and cause some damage with EPPs on the ground.  Flip the objective if they establish some high drains.  This deck should be hard to beat unless they play heavy space and I mean heavy.   '
