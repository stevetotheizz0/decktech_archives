Object of deck
This is a drain deck.  Profit is a nice side thing if opponent doesn't control the AC; freeing Han is not mandatory.  The key to this is to get Tessek to the AC.  Momaw Nadon is good at the AC for beefing up the Ithorians, and then in lategame for moving to Tatooine JP with Han and maybe somebody else to increase opponent's loss to Or Be Destroyed by 1; he can also infiltrate the Holotheatre vs. Hunt Down to cancel Visage if the 2 Transmission Terminateds get cancelled or both used.
With Tessek at the AC, the Ewok Spearman and Ithorians deploy -1 and drains where they are +1.	With Kazak, Ithorians, and Graak on Endor, drains against your opponent are simple brutality.  You'll enjoy handsome drains of at least 4 (barring any opponent modification like Imperial Decree) at Endor sites.
AFA is great for either hurting your opponent for 4 or making him battle you while armed with Sound The Attack and Ewok Rescue.  Ouch.	Either way, your opponent should be hurting badly after that.
Anti cards include 2 Transmission Terminated against HDADTJ with Momaw as a possible reserve way to cancel Visage; Endor Celebration for Occupations; A Gift for opponent's draining and battling with aliens; and R-3PO against spies (esp. ISB and Mara).

In tournament play, this deck has a varied win/loss ratio.  The upside of this is that this deck wins big ( > +20 differential) or loses by a little ( < -15 differential).'
