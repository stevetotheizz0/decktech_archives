Strategy: '

This deck should always start IAO. It stops nabrun and lets most of your guys become forfeit beasts.

VS Ops
-------------------------
This is the only time to start something new. Start Battle Order. Flip ASAP. Get ABC running. Battle at sites where they can drain. If not, inflict damage by attrition and meager drains.

VS Mains
------------------------
You should be able to flip and then react to where ever they oppose you. The Tempest Scouts become very handy, along with the additions to destiny from ROPs. Kill mains. Alter bacta tank and Order to Engage.

VS HB
-------------------------
This is an easy win. Flip early. Use the ships to probe when needed. Shut down there drains to a minimum. Attack at kessel when they cant draw destiny. Blow up X-Wings, Falcons or anything with the guns. They are awesome. After you probe, retreat to your sites if needed.



This deck beat andrew morris's ops 4 times. It beat a version of 'Why Martin Falke is #4 in the world' a few times also. It lost to that deck 1 time and didnt lose to the ops. It is what we call strong. When looking at the deck, it may not look very impressive. If you think that, build it, then play it a few times. You will thank me for giving you such a good deck
