Objective
ISB Ops '

Strategy: '

Use IAO first two turns to pull Yavin and Hoth Docking Bays. Deploy an ISB Agent to each and flip. Then spread and drain. Use Ghhk's when EPP's come down. Against Hidden Base use Dreadnaughts and the DS-61 pilots to fight and probe. The Blue's are just there for some punch. Decree should be set up once you flip so get that out if they're draining you alot or if they play with Revo's. Rest of the stuff is pretty standard.
