Strategy: '

Drop Emperor and gang to occupy a docking bay and start getting lotsa force. When you drop Vader they will probably drop luke as far away as possible. Drop maul to luke’s site with the assistance of BDC, hack him, i have you now, and your gonna be winning by like 20. good against WYS (maul) and just drops 7’s back in and tracks em. its fun to play and solid. thanks =) '
