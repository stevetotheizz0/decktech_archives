READ THE STRATEGY

This deck is original or at least I think it is. Just take out a card you don’t like and throw in a unqiue alien which I forgot because I was in a rush. Basically pull the Echo Docking Bay, put a droid there, and play HDWGITM? to cycle trough your deck. Boussh and the Projections cancel some drains while Luke is for BHBM. Basically pull systems and deploy an X-wing to Kessel or Kiffex and when they attack play Hyper Escape, Houjix, or Barrier. Then you lock S-foils, deploy Incom Corporation, and beat them down. Order to Engage and Draw Their Fire help. Reason for this objective is because of Yarna is immune to alter. Has drain capability. I dunno how good this is yet but at least its original.

Droid selection good overall destiny
Aim High Good vs Ties
Wise Advice For SAC
X-wing Cannons For bounty hunter ships or Ties
