Strategy: 

This deck takes full advantage of the new DS objective, activating huge amounts of force very quickly and dominating Tatooine. Start with the Desert Heart, Jabba’s Palace, reveal Myo as your rep, and use Prepared Defenses to pull No Escape, Power Of The Hutt, and Imperial Arrest Order. On your first turn, you should deploy the Audience Chamber, the Docking Bay 94,  Jabba’s Sail Barge, and the Passenger Deck. That guarantees you 10 force on your second turn, plus any Force your opponent gives you or sites you get in your opening hand. On your second turn, play Boelo, either Jabba or Myo, depending on whether or not you get the other in your opening hand, and begin to set up your stuff. The Abyssians have little trouble holding their own ground, and with the help of your Bounty Hunters and +2 battle destinies from the objective, you should be able to kill anything the opponent throws at you. Once you get Scum And Villainy out, the retrieval and the fun begin. The Cloud City Engineers are to convert back your Jabba’s Palace sites against Profit. If you do play against Profit, I recommend starting with Mara Jade and Myo, to give you an early jump. Try to set up the Tatooine Occupation with your ships, but watch out for X-Wing swarm, because you don’t have many ships. EPP hit squads can pose a threat, but just make sure to keep your sites well covered. I wanted to add some Imperial Barriers and maybe a Ghhhk or 2, but I couldn’t find the space.  Any opinions will be helpful.
