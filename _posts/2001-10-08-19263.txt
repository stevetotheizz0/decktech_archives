Strategy: 

Self explanatory deck....... Train leia..... Deploy encampment on the bog clearing..... Park the skate there, deploy droid merchants aboard....deploy droids,retreive force, Then cycle them into your deck..... Activating force as you go...... Descent into the dark gives you a bottomless reserve deck.....so pump that force into deployment and retreival...... Use mess and r2 to draw cards and deploy what you choose..dump hand..repeat.... Deploy the falcon to dagobah...... Send yoda to tatooine and whip some butt........  

sorry couple of glaring omissions..... the way of things and jedi presence........

note.....revewiers are right...your cards on dagobah cant contribute to retreval....til the objective flips.........then you can do it all you want...you don’t need a huge amount of offense as test 1 slows force drains down to nothing....then you just whack your opponents characters.......and use jedi presense to cause large battle damage...... a gift works wonders on tatooine and also cripples bounty hunting and alien based decks.....feel free to give constructive critisism........ played this in a tournament and won 50% of games, with at least a differential of 30 in each.........
