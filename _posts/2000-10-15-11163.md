Strategy: '

 
Thats how it is, lads. Alien Profit now simply is more consistent than Speed Profit in my opinion. Speed Profit will often lose to BHBM, Hunt Down, and a few other popular decks out there. This route is better. This deck combines a lot of strategies, dealing out direct damage, beatdown potential, and a little retrieval. It pulls all of its locations and key characters from Reserve, and has high 

destiny to boot.


Tunnel Vision is key to this deck. When combined with Insurrection, it allows you to fish out exactly what you need, be it a Jedi Luke, someones Stick, a Barrier, or whatever. It allows me play with only a few mains and still be able to get them on the table quickly.


The 10-card retrievel (from the Obj.) gives you about three to five turns to set up and ignore what the opponent is doing. Let him drain while you eat Visage or Your Destiny and carry out your gameplan.


I have been toying with Elom decks since before the release of DSII, and I believe that Profit is the best platform. Three Signals to get out Wise Advice quickly against a SAC deck, and Staging Areas against anything else. Also a trackable five.
