Strategy: '

For those of you wanting to know who I will train, it will preferably be Melas.  I would wait a turn if it meant getting a Tunnel Vision and getting him in there.  Tawss, Corran and Orrimaarko are too cool IMHO to give up.  If playing a Scum you can train Orrimaarko as backup and against Hunt Down I make Tawss my backup pull if I am having problems.


This deck is designed counter scum and hunt down decks.  You will want to draw up as much as possible early game to get the cards you need.  I have made a little trick here that I think might just work well enough to hurt scum.  Deploy All my Urchins to where you have decent power and deploy Order to Engage to opponents side.  If they attack you, they lose the force they would have gained.  If they do not attack you they lose three force.  This should lead to them attacking you and getting the beat down that they deserve most of the time.  Also if you barrier the characters, would they not lose three force for not attacking in the turn?  I may be wrong about this but it is a thought.


I think people are looking at the deck list and wondering why I have The Way of things.  Well if you do not start it you may never pass jedi test 3.  Even with the high destiny it can take forever to get someone trained.  So I use that, it is auto-competed and you do not have to chase test two around everywhere.


Things to remember

Abuse your jedi test.  Getting test 1 and 2 might be hard to get done at first but remember them and use them.


Cards to Add

Sorry About the Mess/Blaster Proficiency

Endor


Early Game

Pull Yoda to deploy to the Hutt first turn and the home one docking bay and deploy them all.  Then pull a ability four character (preferably Melas) into hand so you know he is there and is okay.  Next turn pull the training area, test 1 and another docking bay.  Deploy Melas to Test 1.  Next turn get it accomplished hopefully then pull and deploy test 2 to the Jungle and move there.  Next turn finish test 2 hopefully, deploy test three and it is done.  Try to pull your Wise Advise either by drawing or by Signals.


Mid Game

You should have your tests done by this point.  Go to them with Urchins following you and drain them with sabers and groups.  They will be forced to come after you at this point to slow you down and then they lose to Urchins.  Just run around and battle at places your Urchins are not at.  That should lead to enough force loss for them.  Try to pull out as many effects as possible.  Order to Engage and Staging Areas will be key at this point.


Late Game

Battle out their remaining characters and force them to run away and lose to order to engage.  Retrieve what all you can with the cycling sixes.  Runs pretty much like a mains deck at this point.


Matchups

VS Hunt Down

Keep Courage and Run Luke Run in hand.  Remember your test three here.  It can be vital to winning.  IF you have tracked destiny go for the courage, if you do not I would run from the first one.  Make them lose to the Urchins and Order to Engage.  That should equal some heavy force loss.  Fallen Portal will be your lifesaver in this matchup.  Just site back and try to drain.


VS Scum

With swarms, I have been shown how Move Along will be your god card.  Try to sit on the docking bays and make them lose to your fallen portals.  A tracked six can wipe out some swarm forces.  Barrier anyone big and chop anyone who poses a threat.


VS Space

Very tough possible matchup.  Test 1 will be a life saver here.  Try to use your ships sparingly where you know you can beat down.  Test 2 should help you out tremendously also.  Unfortuntly you do not have the draining capability I would like but use what you have and retrieve.


VS Bring Him Before Me

Get Wise Advise fast.  They are going to be happy to see you are not starting the combo.  Make them pay for getting Luke.  If you can take out the first couple of squads that would be real sweet.  After they have him though, he is a tough cookie to convert.  Make them lose force trying to stack cards on their objective.
