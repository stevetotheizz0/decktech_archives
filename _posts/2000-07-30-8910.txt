Strategy: '

Ok, I will probably be adding strategy notes from time to time.

You start with MWYHL because of the 4 force you get 2nd turn, plus you should pull Home One DB and drop and ability 4 person there. MWYHL gives me +4 to S/A so that helps when they try to get rid of Fallen Portal. If they grab it, oh well, if they do sense it, then Grab, and Alter it.

Fallen Portal really helps when you want to get rid of Grand Moff Tarkin, Dr Evazan, Sim Aloo, etc. Also, you can hit Vader on a 4 with Your Insight Serves You Well out. Oh and the person you hit with Portal is immediatly lost -)

You shouldn't have a problem with BHBM or Hunt Down. There is some anti - ROps tech in here. I'm a bit weak in space but that's what Savrip is for.

Ok. First you want to get out Home One DB and generate 3 there. Then get out Endor DB and Tatooine DB fast. Then you can have Ben and Jedi Luke (who is now cheaper) together running around battling. Just use your head and you'll do great with this deck. Look at the cards and know what they do before your rate this deck.

Thanks
