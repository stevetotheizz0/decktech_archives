Strategy: '

Before I begin, I just want to let you know that I only have 1 choke Vader and 1 Lord Vader.

I always start with IAO and Mob. Points, but the third effect is optional (usually Something special planned).  If they play jedi training, I start broken concentration instead.

Unless they play JT, first turn use IAO to get either Exe DB or DS2 DB to prevent them from getting any more force.  If you have backup cards in hand (2 vaders, I have you now, duel cards) and you have the force, deploy Endor DB instead and get vader down and flip.  Then just go to them and kill their characters with sniper and duel their luke and obi-wan.  Make them lose a few turns from visage before you battle them, so they can lose some ’defense’ cards first.  Try to get a focused attack quickly by tracking and always keep a holonet transmission in hand to cancel transmission terminated (thats what the masterful moves are for).

Enjoy beating you opponent into the ground '
