Strategy: 

Before I begin, I just want to let you know that I only have 1 choke Vader and 1 Lord Vader.

I always start with IAO and Mob. Points, but the third effect is optional (usually Something special planned).  If they play jedi training, I start broken concentration instead.

Unless they play JT, first turn use IAO to get either Exe: DB or DS2: DB to prevent them from getting any more force.  If you have backup cards in hand (2 vaders, I have you now, duel cards) and you have the force, deploy Endor: DB instead and get vader down and flip.  Then just go to them and kill their characters with sniper and duel their luke and obi-wan.  Make them lose a few turns from visage before you battle them, so they can lose some ’defense’ cards first.  Try to get a focused attack quickly by tracking and always keep a holonet transmission in hand to cancel transmission terminated (thats what the masterful moves are for).

Enjoy beating you opponent into the ground!
