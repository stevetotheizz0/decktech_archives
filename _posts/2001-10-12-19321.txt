Strategy: '

I meant ANother Pathetic Lifeform instead of battleplan combo
Start the podrace immediately. Get Yoda out as soon as possible. Worry about the Senate and Naboo for the first turns. Get some council members there and send them off to try to stop the opponent on Naboo. After you get the objective flipped with some senators, which should be easy with 2 copies of most of them in here, get the Podrace done as fast as possible, but save the retrieval for when you need it. Get Boonta Eve to help with the retrieval(I Did It). Start to worry about knocking out their space, take control of space with Ric and Queen’s ship, and Radiant and Madakor. While doing space take Naboo and get Amidala into the senate. Or use Pamde first to get Obi and Qui, then replace her. With the take over of Naboo you should start retrieving force massivly. Use the Either way you wins later in the game when you need some more cards back. Force Drain a lot on Naboo and use all the effects and senators to try to take away all of their battle destinies.  Pananka and his blaster are great because they add 3 to your power when it hits.
THIS DECK WILL ONLY WORK IN CLOSED ENVIRONMENT. Please only review this as a Ep 1 deck, because I already know it would get killed in unrestricted.
