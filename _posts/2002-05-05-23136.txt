Strategy: 

It’s really hard to write about a well known deck type, but I try.

The Shields:
Come Here You Big Coward
Battle Order
Weapon Of A Sith
You’ve Never Won A Podrace
A Useless Gesture
Allegations Of Corruption
Do They Have A Code Clearance? 
Leave Them To Me 
Wipe Them Out, All Of Them
We’ll Let Fate-a Decide, Huh?

I played this deck a year ago, but I submitted the modified deck(with Shields, new cards). The orignal deck had only one loss(only by one card, that game was a real match-up).

It’s a normal Hunt Down, that tries to duel the opponent’s Jedi with Maul(there is TWBNM4U) and Vader. Though I can use Maul for duelling, I suggest battling the Jedis with him. With Maul strikes nobody can stand against him, espaially Qiu-Gonn.
I repeat DO NOT duel Qui-Gonn with Maul!
If you have to, use Mara to duel Luke. Mara is awesome with here power six.

I use the DB-s, becuase I don’t like to waste a turn to re-deploy Vader. In that, and next turn I lose 2 Force. I know that it gives force to the opponent, but I have to risk it to deal with those pesky Jedi, fast.

After you finished the Jedi, drain them down.

I think a LS combat will be a real match-up for this deck. But if you play smartly you will win. I didn’t play against LS-combat with this deck so I can’t give a better advice.But here in my area nobody plays with it.

Thank you for reading my deck, please rate it high!
