Deck Types:

Doesn’t really matter, this deck plays based on a dominant strategy basis aka you play it the same every time and against everyone.

This deck is pretty common for a Endor Tie Deck but I decided to post it because it’s a good deck that has won me alot of matches. This deck is however dieing as more and more people are relizing Don’t Do That Again is worth the card slot. So until decipher revives it I bid farwell to this deck.
