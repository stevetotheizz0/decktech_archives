Strategy: '

ok.....1st off some changes you might want to make
-you can take the vaders out & put in some #’s.....with all the guys being 3 except  system get-her @#$% it’s all good
-also accuser can be switched for barriers
-& some grabbers would be good(VERY)
other than that it’s just your personal playing style that matters this deck i played at the worlds vs a lot of the yellow carders on day 1(people who won regionals or continentals)
& i won 12 out of 12 with this one.......so it’s good & people are not used to this space stuff as much & dont usually know how to play vs em
that’s about it just get your systems out & drian while shotting anything that comes at you
example 
some guy attacked my merrjk with dreadnaught & 2 ties at death star before
he put down homeone/acbar,tantive/KFC
it was early game cause i give lots activation
anyhow i had one wepon......i depoy anoher wepon from reserve with fire zone
i hit BOTH capitals & ended up loosing the wepons to my use & the merjjk
this deck RAPES try it out

bu i can trak destiny	 it helps in this deck
