Strategy: '

Start off with five force, then get out War Room first turn with objective. Nice force starting off. From here on get out your sites and drain them. All the Battleground sites are drain 2. This is basically a pure draining deck that activates a lot. Terrible destiny, but control with pure power. Not much strategy involved.'
