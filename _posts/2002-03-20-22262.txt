*****STRATEGY*****
-If you look at this deck closely you might say ”wait this looks like other ISB trooper decks”, but guess what? It isn’t. I’ve been playing with ISB troopers ever since D*2 came out and I think it’s freakin solid. There’s not a whole lot you can do to beat this deck. If you can up with a deck that consistently beats this one please tell me cause I haven’t come across one. Please Read Strategy before dumping all your praise upon me for the superiority of this deck (jk)

-EARLY GAME- Get Carida first action for activation, it’s gametext may be useful later on. Get Death StarDB out and plop down Suba (if you don’t have Suba in your hand first turn, don’t worry, you want to draw alot early because this deck sets up so fast). Suba will sart getting your troops out with Tac Support and they all deploy FREE at the D*Db. Start moving your forces out depending on what deck they are playing. This deployment is SO rapid that your opponent will not be able to catch up with you. Keep drawing until you get the stuff you need to do your super space beatdown.

-MID GAME- You should own the ground and causing your opponent to focus more on space (that is if you haven’t allready finished them off by your battling combo Full Scale Alert/Trooper Assault/Dark Jedi Presence). Use your killer combos in space to devastating and taking their main systems (example WYS-Tatooine, QMC-Bespin, RST-Endor, etc). Once you gain control of their system your basically saying ”good game, it’s over” because they’ve either stacked at one site or are just plain running from you on the ground and you just took away their hope to survive in space too with Zuckuss with 4LOM inside, Guri and the Stinger, Lat Damage (they can’t cancel all of them), Dengar, etc.

-LATE GAME- There proly won’t be a late game because you’ve already won, but if they are somehow trying to out drain you, don’t forget, you’re playing ISB and you will out drain them.


****MATCHUPS****
-WYS- This deck will desimate WYS. Take the Cantina early and draw your ships to get a good beat down in space. Don’t take Kessel, take Tatooine so they can’t celebrate. All their drains will be minus one at related LOCATIONS and bonuses are canceled cause of Imp Decree so put SpaceportDB on Kessel and sit some troops there and bam They can only drain of 1 at Kessel You will easily beat WYS.

-QMC- Battle combo them on Cloud city, and don’t worry, they can never stop the beatdowns (houjix may help them once but just do it again). If they keep running somehow from Full Scale Alert, your going to take their system for sure anyway so you will easily win.

-RST- This deck can’t survive against ISB if you play smart, unless you’re having trouble deploying to Endor sites (I don’t have EndorDB). Just flood the bunker to start with and then try and wipe them out on the ground. You will also easily take their system. YOU WIN.

-LS COMBAT- Ahh. Someone told me I would get beat by combat and I spit at them (not really) Just deploy SpaceportDB to Naboo and send the whole crew to ’em. Battle Order will kill ’em with my space force and there’s pretty much no way they can stop the beatdown. HA HA HA HA... sorry just getting all excited inside over the power of this deck. YOU WIN.


---WELL FELLOWS, please tell me what ya think Any critique or praise is welcome I respect the opinion of weathered players, if you don’t know what you’re talking about, then don’t review. Peace out hommies
