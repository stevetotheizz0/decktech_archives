Strategy: 

This deck is kinda simple to play.  If you can get EBO out by the 2nd or 3rd turn your in good shape.  Use tunnel visions and signals to pull out effects that you need.  Incom Corps are great b/c it makes ur X-Wings much more powerful and u need only 4 instead of 7 against Zuckuss in boat to get a destiny.  Early in the game use all wings report in and organized attack to take out your X-Wings.When ur down a fair amount of force and have a lot of X-Wigns retrieve ur force using All Wings report in. Pull out ur characters u need with Echo Base Garrison and ur in good shape. D-Mail me with suggestions please. and rate my deck so i can do the same
