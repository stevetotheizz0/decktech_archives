Strategy: 

Okay, so if you cant figure out what this deck does, you start the Galactic Senate as your Coruscant location, you set up a few Senators in the Galactic Senate, you use Lott Dodd to Tunnel Vision for whatever card you need, and then you try and set up Tatooine Occupation, Ability^3, and Search and Destroy for some big damage.  Use your ISB agents to pump up your drains and reduce/cancel your opponents.  And If you do take some force loss, use Abyssin Ornament or Squabbling Delegates to retrieve.

Well, Devon, thats great, but youll lose to a LS Senate Deck, for sure.

On the contrary, if my opponent is playing LS senate, I get to see what objective they play before I fulfill my objectives deployment requirements.  In this case, I deploy Sp. Ed. Coruscant, occupy it, and prevent any further deployment.  From there, since I have isolated their senators (and since my Admirals are politics 2), I beatdown on the senate and win from there.  LS Senate is a non issue.

Okay, maybe!  But you only start with 1 force icon.  Are you going to activate enough?

Yes, sir!  I get to deploy docking bays directly from my reserve deck, and then Mobilization Points and Tikkes boost my force generation at those sites.  If I control both Tatooine Docking Bays I will activate 8 force between those 2 sites alone.  Ive got activation covered!

Yeah, but what about your destinies?  I mean, your destinies are so low.  Youll never be able to cause any attrition with them.

True, I have a lot of high power characters, walkers, and star destroyers, and that translates into a low destiny average.  However, by mid to late game, I will have pulled so many cards with Lott Dodd, Imperial Command, and Squabbling Delegates, there wont be many low destiny cards left in my deck.  From there, with some intelligent destiny tracking, I can pick my opponent apart.

Well . . . umm . . . you suck!

Okay, now youre hitting below the belt.

GENERAL STRATEGY

Early Game: Pull your sites.  Pull The Executor.  Use Imperial Command, Abyssin Ornament, and Squabbling Delegates to pull cards.  Pull your Senators in this order: Lott Dodd, Tikkes, Aks Moe, Edcel Bar Gane, Passel Argente.  Pull Tatooine and your damaging effects.

Mid Game: Take control of a couple of Tatooine sites and set up Occupation, Ability^3, S&D, and Were In Attack Position Now (Hey, even just 2 of them would be good).  Let them do their thing, and use Aks Moe and ISB Operations add to your drains.  Use your UC spies, ISB modifiers, and Den of Thieves to cancel drains.  Battle wisely, and your opponent wont be able to keep up.

Late Game:  Use Squabbling Delegates and Abyssin Ornament to retrieve any losses you might have sustained.  Cancel more drains.  Cause more damage.  Report your win.

MATCH-UPS

Vs. Podracing:  You lose the race.  Okay, no big deal.  Retrieve the losses with Squabbling, ISB, and Abyssin and work from there.  6 force loss is manageable, and realistically, 10 retrieval will only slow you down about a turn and a half.

Vs. Senate:  Like I said, start Coruscant instead of the Galactic Senate.  The best thing you have going for you is the surprise factor.  Suddenly, when you halt their deployment by occupying Coruscant and then jump their senators in the chamber, they wont know what hit them.

Vs. Profit:  Start Arica undercover in the Audience Chamber.  Try and keep your forces centered on 2 sites.  Even if your opponent manages to free Han, which they should eventually, they still wont be able to out damage you.  And by that time, you should be well enough set up that your opponent might not even be able to afford to retrieve.

Vs. WYS:  Imperial Command and Edcel Bar Gane keep destinies in check.  Walkers trample smugglers.  5d6-RA7 owns them.  Damage is TOO massive.

Vs. MWYHL:  Ask anybody who plays MWYHL.  Testing folds to any deck that deals massive amounts of damage.  What does this deck do?

Vs. Hidden Base:  Tough match-up.  Consolidate your space forces and probe 1 by 1.  Although, you should be able to get 3 systems in the first turn after they flip.  Otherwise, set up your damage and let it ride.

Vs. EBO:  Another tough match-up.  However, as long as you concentrate on holding Tatooine, you should be able to edge your opponent out with your massive amounts of damage.

Vs. RST:  Use Maul and Vader to hold down the Bunker.  With Lott Dodd, you should have no problem pulling them.

Vs. Anything else:  Just play your game.  With this much damage, youre going to win.

Enjoy!  Any questions, D-Mail me.
