Strategy: '

This is a farely basic deck. As soon as they start draining play suprise assault and kick there a@#.  I put in the endor celebrations to cancel those annoying non force draining loses.  This deck will almost always win against a my kind of scum deck or ties but it has trouble with high power guys.  Thats where anger fear agression comes in.  This is a really fun deck to play with and it usually finishs with a good diferential. '
