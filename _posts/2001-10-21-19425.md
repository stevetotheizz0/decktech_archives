Strategy: '

WYS isnt dead, its merely balanced.


Some card choices 


Edge Main retrival aside from podrace. Only used when there are characters or effects you want back because WYS plays the interrupts. Also good for getting rid of the ROC combo. 


Podracing This deck has never lost a podrace. The destinies are insane, and you can cycle back the high ones with Mirax and 3P0. 2 ASB, 2 Too Close, and 2 Board help you win the race with ease. Make sure to save even if Secret Plans

isnt out, because thats usually when it comes out. 


Melas x2 Tat Maul can be a pain, and hes one of 3 characters in the deck that can battle him. 


Mirax and 3P0 They are my best friends. The abilty to cycle 2 cards through the deck every turn is huge. Theyre also great for tracking for Edge or for the podrace. 


Lost In The Wilderness This card is great also. Get rid of Vader in a Huntdown, Xizor in AOBS, Maul, Palpy, or any lone main holding a site. And with the destiny of this deck, youre garaunteed to make someone go missing. 


Celebration x2 I found that masterful Move combo is a pain, and is in most decks, so if they cancel your first, play another and retrieve the first one. 


Some cards I had in here, but they didn&#8217;t make the final cut 

R-3P0

RFC

I*ll Take The Leader (AO)

X-Wing Laser Cannon

Rebel Artillery


Match-ups


ISB If they stick 5D6 at an exterior site, drain for 0, cancel it with Lost In The Wilderness, and make the droid go hungry. Once you get rid of him, you should have an easier time. ISB is not an easy match-up, espeically if its the Walkers. Then, you have to make sure to keep Menace Fades

in effect, and watch out for the Black Sun AO. Your race damage/retrival, Celebration, and Edge retrival should be enough to outlast them. 


Hunt Down If they are racing, youll most likely win. Get out HotJedi fast so they have to lose to Visage while you laugh at them. When they get No Escape, use one of your OOC&TTs to cancel during their move phase. Lost In The Wilderness is huge. 


Senate Your toughest match-up. Try to get BP/DTF out early and Revo their main force generation (usually Mauls Site or the Bridge). Play smart, and try to avoid beatdown situations. You will

usually win, but it can be tough.


BHBM Use EPP Luke to suicide a few times before givng Jedi Luke to Vader about 4th or 5th turn. Lost in the Wilderness is huge again. The constant

loss of force from their objective and your drains shold be enogh to beat them. Try to avoid beatdowns again so you dont have to stack.


AOBS Make Xizor missing, or go kill him. If hes with a big group, drop Jedi Luke in the Cantina with 2-3 smugglers for forefit. If they are racing, you*ll win the race. Should be a pretty easy matchup. 


Brangus Drain for three at their D*. Win the race, because this deck has never lost one. Drain for a bunch more that them. Edge the ROC combo away and you should be fine.


Watto Get HotJedi and start losing 2 each turn so their cards go back and you dont lose any. If they get around Honor, it&#8217;s usually smart to lose 2 anyway. Take one of the EPPs and kill Watto, because when I have played this deck, he is usually alone. 


LTMTFM Against this, find a place to drop Jedi Luke. Make them come to you. That way, you can drop a few smugglers to felp beat up the Jedi, as well as chop them with Luke. Grab I Have You

Know, as that will most likely be a card played often in this deck. As for Lightsaber Combat, you shoul at least be close to their total, even if they stack cards. You shouldn&#8217;t have a difference of 5 or greater, so Honor should kick in. 


Defensive Shields


A Useless Gesture Just play your game as normal, not all of the interrupts are Lost. It basically only hinders late game retrival, which Celebration should be taking care of anyway. Just dont play those Interrupts like a willy-nilly

schmuck and you should be fine. Its not as bad as it seems. 


You*ve Never Won A Race? This is a battling deck, so yor opponent should only have 1-2 battlegrounds when you finish the race. A 14 (they lose 4, you retrieve 6, and you retrieve 4 more with IDI) force swing is still good. Also, you should have no problem holding 3 battlegrounds to keep I Dit It intact, so this is almost wasted. 


Other Defensive Sheilds Always be prepared for Coward or Secret Plans, but you can usually expect them. These are nothing different. The other ones dont really affect you, aside from the grabber, but that is also a possibility in normal

constructed, so its the same.  '
