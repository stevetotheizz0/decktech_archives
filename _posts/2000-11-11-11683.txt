Strategy: '

As always start with a the Generators, North Ridge, the Signal, and A New Secret Base. Pull Echo Base Garrison and an Echo site first turn before you activate, put out the Echo docking bay as your last Echo site so the Dark side can’t transit to Hoth.

	Pull Hoth Luke, Wedge, then Zev and deploy them in that order to occupy the Echo sites. Later on, put Hobbie in an X-wing and he can take on Star Destroyers. Use the Ice Storms when Imperials try deploy on Hoth, and leave Luke or Obi at the Echo dock. bay to take care of Imperials that transit to there.

	Put Corporal Marmor at a docking bay and deploy the X and Y-wings to retrieve each turn. Don’t deploy more than one or two systems until you have plenty of starships and systems in hand, just stockpile both of them in hand. After you have as many systems as possible, deploy each of them in one turn along with all the ships you have. You’ll get a really good drain next turn just as long as your opponent dosn’t have a bunch of ships in hand or on table within hyperspeed.

	Insurrection is in there mainly to prevent the Dark side from Nabrun Leiding to Echo sites.

	 I just won with this deck this afternoon, the effects and interrupts really balance it out against a wide range of decks. Thanks...Review Well '
