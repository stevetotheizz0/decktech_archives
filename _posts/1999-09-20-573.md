Strategy: '

ALWAYS START WITH DS.....unless you know opponent's deck....coninue reading...


Ok, this is a pretty straight forward Big Blue deck. Let's put things clear against most of the Ls deck right now



MWYHL start def. per. (to 'cancel' asap Battle Plan) and oppressive renforcement. If they doing all the tests with retreival and everything, search asap for Secret Plans and CHYBC.

Ops start the death star and opp. renf. search for key effect at first, (imp. decree, battle order, Bright center...)

Mains Tosche start the DS and opp. renf. again. Grab many powerfull int. such as Sense, Alter, It could Be Worse...etc. search for There is no try for a complete protection against SAC and beatdown.

Mains Revo start DS and opp. renf. again. for the rest you should not have problem activating, don't be affraid to draw a lot....it's pretty immune to grimtashh anyway And look for that evader and play it well ( opp renf. + there is no try on table).

HBX Start DS or Def perimeter and opss renforcement, grab those it could be worse, all wing report in, and organised attack. Search for key effect and use Lat damge brightly.

Massive Ewok Drain No, don't laugh, i saw a powerfull drain ewok deck that can drain for about 20 in about 3-4 turn....start Def per and Imp. decree.

any other decks.......use your skill, play that deck the way you like it.....good player should do very well with it.

btw, i've used it in my regional and in the team Tourney the day after and i lost only 1 game against an HBX...(i probed with Those rebels won't escape us....well anyway.)

Good Luck '
