Strategy: '

Start with 6 or more force, you can deploy mos espa docking bay from reserve deck and either put some characters down if you can or try to draw your sites or mindful of the future. Ardon vapor crell deploys free to tatooine so you don`t have to pay +6 for him, he adds to force drains where you have a vaporator or hydroponics station at exterior sites or +2 to force drains where you have both, location farm lets you deploy them to that site from reserve deck. 


Chewie and Han are very powerful characters on the ground where Han adds a battle destiny and can shoot someone and life debt adds another 2-battle destiny when they are together. Use your starships in space to try and control tatooine to get tatooine celebration, so you can retrieve a force for every battleground you occupy. Narrow escape lets you move to an adjacent site when a battle is initiated which is very powerful and old ben can revive a character on tatooine. Underworld contacts is a brilliant card, the opponent can`t cancel a force drain where you have 2 aliens with different card titles and gives you +1 force generation on a site. Insurrection is so they can`t elis herlot beatdown on you, 


-vs- huntdown

 Try and get your other sites out, if you get the farm you can deploy vaporator or hydroponics station for more force draining when you have got ardon vapor crell, start draining at your sites, if the opponent comes down use rebel barrier to stop a character from battling, or use narrow escape to cancel the battle and go to the adjacent site, or if you have han and chewie, use life for 2 more battle destiny and the objective adds one and the forfeit of characters is brilliant, and use jedi escape is vader comes down to luke.


-vs- invasion

Start like usual with 6 or more force, get your space down to tatooine, squadron assignments helps this especially, the rallitiir freighter captain can pilot the falcon, get big drains going and use underworld contacts so they can`t cancel or modify the drain, 

add loads of battle destiny so they lose loads of druids or loads of force, and if they drain for 3 or more use vergeance in the force to modify it down to 1.


-vs- bring him before me

Setup like usual getting your sites out, hopefully drawing a mindful of the future to get out a site, if they play on endor or any other place or docking, drain with your stuff on tatooine and use underworld contacts so they can`t cancel or modify your force drains on tatooine and when you control tatooine, if you have it tatooine celebration, use it and start retrieving force every turn, if they play on tatooine try and do lots of damage, use palace raiders and life debt and han with heavy blaster pistol and the objective to add battle destiny, if vader comes down and takes luke, try and release him, it doesn`t matter too much, insurrection is just in case they play elis herlot, they won`t be able too, only during move phase.


-vs- lightsaber combat

Start out as usual trying to get your sites, space shoudln`t be too difficult, because some combat decks I`ve seen don`t play space but even if they do you can kick them off, you have got big force drains and use underworld contacts so they can`t cancel or modify your drains and if they drain with maul`s double bladed lightsaber you can play vergeance and reduce it right down.
