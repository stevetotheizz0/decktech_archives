Strategy: 

Well its based on the drazin game text and special delivery. Keep retriving force while you drain with you troopers all over Cloud City.
The 3 ships are in there due to hidden base not to beat it in battle but to find it and and cancel the objective.  Counterattack is a powerful and underrated card that shines in this kind of deck.  There are 3 differnt alterations for this decks starting effects.  There is no try is good aganist any traing deck because they will alter and sense every card you play once its fliped but you still need the arrest order to stop the nabrun leids to drazin.	Security precautions for a hidden base.  Startegic Reserves for opertives but again you still need the arrest ordre. Thanks for your time I am new at this so give me a little break just this once
thanks
