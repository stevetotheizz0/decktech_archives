Basic notes:

Get out T:JP and the Chamber asap. Start with any methods fett,fett in s1 and dungeon.
Deploy Chall, S&V and Jabba along with ORS to Chamber, then spread your forces and drain, drain,
retrieve with S&V and Objective.

Most of the cards that went in are uc protection. S&D for Hidden Base and Training decks, torture for numbers (which arent big
in my region, aswell as SAC. Jabbas SC instead of S&V Dreadnaughts keeps S&V alive.

thats all....finished 3rd on the German Nationals with that (Ls deck was "Break Stuff" as seen on DeckTech

PS: REVO is DEAD in GERMANY !!!!!!

PPS: For all that say, there arent nough Charcaters, the ones that are in there keep comming back !!!
