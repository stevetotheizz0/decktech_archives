Strategy: 

First of all, Id like to point out that this is PRE Reflections 3(as in before its release). Also, yes I do own a Maul With Saber foil. If you dont have one, you could switch it for a Tatooine Maul. You could also try and fit in a second saber then.

Anyways, this deck is a BEAST. It causes overflow in just about every battle. When it drains, it drains for a TON. It hasnt lost yet when Ive played with it (something like 10-0 or something).

Well here is what you do (usually)
Before you activate, get Carida. Activate, and try and flip with Lott Dod. If you dont have Lott Dod, still flip just to get your political effects out. Lott Dod is the KEY to this deck. He sets up EVERYTHING in the deck. He pulls your guys, sites, and everything else.  There are 5 ways to get him out, either get Lott Dod in your hand, or one of 3 squabblings. Try and get the Bridge out first turn too.

From there, the deck plays itself. If your opponent deploys characters to the ground, use Maul or Vader with either support or interrupts and cause overflow. Dont forget to use your +3/-3 Political Effects (6 more swing in your favor). Here is an example of what COULD happen. Say WYS has EPP Luke and EPP Han in the Cantina. Drop down EPP Vader with like P-59 or something. Battle. First play I Have You Now, let them swing. Then play You Are Beaten to exclude Luke. Swing at Han. Hit Han with P-59 (so they lose 2). Draw your 3 destiny to their none - average of about 4 when flipped so that is 12. Add 3 to destiny - so that&#8217;s 6+4+12+3 = 25 to their 4. They lose Han and 21 more. Beatdowns like this occur ALL GAME due to Lott Dod. In space, use Lateral Damage and Zuckuss with your other ships to create beatdowns. If they DO happen to get a destiny somewhere, subtract 3 from it.

If your opponent decides not to go to the ground, set up at the Cantina and add 2 to the drain every turn with the Political Effect.

The 3 Grabbers is HUGE. It hurts many decks, including WYS. Also, Ghhhk combo cancels stupid stuff like Dodge and Hyper Escape, so you can cancel then grab the cards.

You should all know what the senators do, Toonbuck adds to attrition, Tikkes to activation, Orn Free allows you to take destinies into hand, etc.


Anyways, some matchups:

Watch Your Step
This deck has NOT lost to any version of WYS yet. Just try and cause as much overflow as possible in consecutive battles and grab their key interrupts. If they try and deploy early stuff like EPP Luke or Dash in Outrider, beat them up for overflow. It shouldnt be too tough to win this game (just trust me on this one).

Hidden Base
Set up at the Cantina with Maul. Either wait for an opening for a beat down in space or get out Security Precautions and probe as soon as you can. You SHOULD win this matchup.

Any other ground decks
BEATS. Cause OVERFLOW. They wont know what to do. Just continuously come at them with Maul/Vader and use your interrupts and Political Effects.

Against other Space decks
Set up in the Cantina, and look for openings. THERE ARE ALWAYS OPENINGS. Dont forget to cancel there biggest drain.


Final thoughts
All of the Political Effects are HUGE. Their texts are just too useful, so dont forget to use them.
Cause OVERFLOW. Its amazingly simple with this deck.
PLAY SMART - always a good idea.
Dont forget your Senators texts. ALL OF THEM have texts, and most are useful.
