Objective
Raltiir Operations/In the Hands of the Empire '

Strategy: '

This is a very strong Rallops deck that when played right can be very deadly.You start with the objective and raltiir and Twilek Advisor. I always start with Bad Feeling Have I so all mains deploy +4. I then get out either a site or a biker scout depending if I have a site in my hand. Once I get out my biker scout I get out the speeder bike for some power to control and I do the same at all the three sites to flip the objective. Once it is flipped I get out any card I want depending what I need. I also get out the 3 droids with the biker scouts and it makes all their characters deploy +4 and mains +6. The Navy Trooper Vesden is in their for odds. The Scanning Crew's are in their to get rid of rebels and know whats in store for you. It is good against most decks because it lets you get out any card to stop the objective. It is mainly defensive and you get out cards to battle them at other places. The tramples are in for the undercover spies and crush the rebellion is there to stop Revo decks.

This deck has done well for me and I would like some feedback. '
