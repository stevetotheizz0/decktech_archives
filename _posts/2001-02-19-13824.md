Ok, first I’ve been playtesting this a lot lately and I think it could be stronger. I am posting this to get as much help as I can. 


For most matchups get Kessel asap, pulling zeros out is good; draw till you get The Big One and setup Asteroid Sanc, even with a scrub ship, and start draining; use mains to hit characters on the ground


Hunt Downget a OOC/TT to get rid of Visage then keep Luke away from Vader


BHBMget a few chars into hand, then get Scout Luke and drop as much to the site and smash whatever is left


Scum/Court I haven’t played against these, I’ll give it a guess. Don’t leave anyone alone, they will get smashed. Use Luke and Han with Blaster to clear the AC if they spread out too much.


TIE fighter swarmget Asteroid Sanc out and then go to ground, most ties won’t live through the Fields
