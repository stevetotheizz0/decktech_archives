sorry take out a balanced atack and a ooc/tt and put in a anikan saber and a hftmf.......



well this is what you do, pull crix and general... take out cok then use rebel leadership to take out oppoents ground.... then ackbar in home 1 is there just to hold onto endor so u can have menace fades or stuff.against ties take out the drain guy so you can drain against them.... on the edge is so you can retrive and also lose a guy in a losing battle to cancel it... but basicly that dosenâ€™t happen cause you will come beat them done..... also take out blount early to go after the lone charecter activating at a db....... rebel leadership is also GOLD against decks that use stuff like mighty jabba and ig-88 and sim aloo..... make them get 1 destiny then subtract 3 from it hmm..... or cancel it with general solo? GOLD. also u can use endor celebration for a few extra force.... a key crd in this deck it tunnel vision so that you get the key battle interupts........ tell me what u think. '
