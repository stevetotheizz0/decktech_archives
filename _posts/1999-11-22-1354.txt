Strategy: '

This Deck is simple to learn but hard to adjust to other decks unless you play it enough to learn it.  The main focus is to get droids and ships out with inserts.  Use the grabbers to grap Torture first then any other pain card second (SAC, Retrieval, etc).  If they start Resistance (not very often because they will always think revolver) play the ships in space as soon as you can or play some driods with Luke or Obi hanging out.  Be careful if you leave Luke or Obi alone though, only do it against certain decktypes so a beatdown does not occur.  Use the Bacta Tank to recycle the mains and use them mostly for hit and run missions.  One important thing to remember is to either use R2 at a scomplink or as the undercover spy.  Make sure you get Droid Shutdown as soon as possible if you plan on playing Undercover.  If you lose it just effective repairs for it.  Good Luck.  Scott Lingrell'
