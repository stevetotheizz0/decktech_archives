Strategy: '

This is a draining deck that utilizes the Overseeing It Personally and the direct damage of Occupation to cripple your opponent.  

Always start Mob Points and Insurrection.  The third effect depends on what the opponent plays.  Before activating be sure to pull the Executor.    During our first turn pull two DBs; one with the Objective and one with Insurrection.  Deploy Mara with Stick to the AU Chamber for the quick drain next turn.  

Next turn see what the opponents does.  If he goes to space then set up your drains and Seek and Destroy on the ground.  If he is playing very little space deploy ZiMH to Tatooine and set up Occupation.  If you need more space do not forget that the objective pulls your BH ships.  The Admiral’s Orders in this deck stops those pesky multiple draws on the ground.  You have three spies in the deck so Nevar Yalnal works pretty good.  I hate I Know, so SLNH was put in and it is a 6 destiny.

If played right this deck is a beast.
I will add more tech later when I have time.  Because if you look at the cards in this deck there is alot more to be said.
