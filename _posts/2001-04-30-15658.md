*UPDATE*

Everyone has made some great points, and after talking it over with Dustin for a while we decided that this deck can work after Tatooine, itll just have to be designed a little bit differently.  For one thing, the reason we initially thought otherwise was that the Battle Plan start slowed the opponent enough to get yourself off to a better start.  We thought Keepin the Empire Out Forever *might* upset part of the balance of the deck.  *BUT* we now believe we were wrong.  This deck CAN start with KtEOF and still work, and why?  Though your opponent may have an easier time force draining, the pull ability will speed the whole deck up enough to compensate for that extra force loss.  With some of the new cards well find that some of the older cards can be replaced with better ones and more efficiently keep the deck working.  Overall, we just had the wrong idea; we were thinking wrong  Besides, we wanted to play Battle QMC after playing this for so long ;-)


*Second Update*

Some of the comments have been directed toward how Home 1 dies in space and how specific different cards kill the deck.  My response?  The Home 1 is still pretty hard to kill.  Keep in mind that with Capital Support pilots deploy for next to nothing and it is immune to attrition < 12.  You also have Medium Bulk Frieghters which are immune <6 and an Independence that can be immune <6.  So yeah, if they can pull a HUGE combo together than they might be able to take it out, but by that time theyll be dead from all the drains  Secondly, OF COURSE there will ALWAYS be some killer card that if someone plays it a deck just withers.  That is just a fact of life in most cases.  Specifically, Blast Door Controls will hurt a lot.  But even if that comes out, you still got Path and can throw some good, powerful characters at them.  Overall, that means that even if BDC hits the table you still have a decent chance, youll just have to work harder.


*To Avatar*

Yep, you’re right, our opinion is, in fact, only an opinion.  You just gotta choose what you think is best.  We thought this was best, and hey, it worked


*End Updates*


READ THE STRATEGY  THIS DECK IS NOT JANK  It was played at Missouri States by Dustin Horn, and Dustin WON MISSOURI STATES WITH THIS DECK, and was *undefeated* with it.  Since Im his brother and he isnt involved in Decktech, I get to post it.  PLEASE understand, it may look like much, but its got it where it counts  This is the best QMC youll find before Tatooine, we even think it is better than QMC Avatar Style.  


This deck began with Dustin and I looking at the QMC Avatar Deck.  Dustin said, I bet we could make this better using the Home One in space and Capital Support damage on ground, not even worrying about Squadron Assignments  Well, this is what we came up with, and this is what took states


First off, THE CARDS YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT


QMC/Independent Operation - Not many people remember the flip side benefits, so here we go your independent starships AND aliens are immune <4, independent starships and aliens deploy - 1, and wherever you have an alien your force drains may not be modified or canceled.  Once you flip, this deck takes FULL advantages of the perks.


Balanced Attack - destiny 4 used interrupt - Search your reserve deck and take one Admiral or General into hand; reshuffle. - Basically another Strike Planning that can pull Admirals also.


Capital Support - Admirals Order - Each pilot deploys -1 (or -2 if an admiral) aboard a capital starship.  Each Capital starship with a pilot character aboard is immune to attrition <4 (or adds 2 to immunity if starship already has immunity).  During each of your control phases, opponent loses 1 force for each battleground site your general controls that is related to a system you occupy.  - A Quasi-Occupation card that also allows my pilots to deploy cheaper and boosts my immunity.  Whats really cool about this is that with QMC flipped any independent starship is immune to attrition <4.  This means that with a pilot you can have Freighters with immunity to attrition < 6  Pretty nice if you ask me...


Path of Least Resistance - Everybody knows the text, but realizing that you can do this at anytime gives you an advantage.  You can use this during the weapons phase of a battle (a good way to run from battles assuming they dont have a weapon), during your turn to move someone to force drain, during your turn to move a powerful guy for a beatdown, etc.  Dont forget that


WHY ANH Chewbacca? - Hes an alien pilot who has a power of six (seven if Han at same site).  Cool enough for me


WHY Core Tunnel? - You get a +1 force drain if Lando there, and your aliens are power +1 there, and the opponents aliens are forfeit -1.  Good benefits.  If you like replace it with a site that gives a drain -1 to opponent.


WHY Rebel Leadership? - Cycling interrupt that works almost the same way as Imperial Command, and everyone knows what that does.  Really great to turn the tides of a battle with an extra destiny.


WHY Hnemthe? - Alien pilot, makes imperials deploy +2.  Thats cool.


WHY Pucumir Thyress? - Makes force drains at related Cloud City sites +1.


General Strategy (pun intended)


You will almost always start Strike Planning, Battle Plan, and YISYW.  At the end of your opponents turn pull two generals with Strike Planning (preferably Solo and Calrissian) and Launching the Assault with Insights.  First of your turns deploy and a site from reserve, checking to see if Home One is in your reserve.  If so, deploy Launching and pull Home one.  The other thing youll want to make sure you have is Ackbar.  With two Ackbars and 2 Balanced Attacks, you will almost always be able to either get one from your starting hand or your first draw.  


Ideally, youll now have Ackbar, Home One, and enough saved force to have at least 13 the next turn.  This might not happen even though this deck was made to do it, but if not it should only set you back a turn.  2nd turn deploy Home one, Capital Support, Ackbar, and as many pilots as possible.  Remember that Ackbar can pull the missing link of your stuff, which will be either Capital Support or another Squid-guy.  Also deploy a site.  3rd turn deploy Calrissian and a Freighter to flip.  


If they control a site this may need to wait until you have enough force to also deploy someone there and move.  Find Celebration and get a few sites controlled with a general.  Keep in mind that unless your opponent has either deployed to Bespin or deployed another system with a guy, theyre paying 3 for each drain due to Battle Plan.  Now your opponent is taking a lot of damage and he has to do something, because you have Battle Plan and Menace Fades stopping his drains, great drains and occupation damage, and your retrieval to cap it off.  Hell need to come battle you  So lets say he tries...  Every time, you run away with Path or Narrow Escape.  As this happens you can either force drain and Capital Support him into oblivion, or you can slowly build up your assault team.  Eventually he might make the error of spreading out too much, and thats when you can take the advantage through battling.  Say he moves Vader to the same site as General Han.  You deploy EPP Leia, Chewbacca, Path to get EPP Luke over there, battle.  Play Rebel Leadership, hit Vader, draw three destiny, cancel his destiny, you have power of like 24 to his six.  18 damage, game NEARLY over.  Let Battle Plan keep him from draining after you get him down to like 3 cards and retrieve for all youre worth.  You win by huge amount.


Matchups


Hunt Down - This deck beat Hunt Down three times in States, and those decks were played by the second and third place guys.  So to HD we say EAT IT  No really, you got Bespin and Hnemthe to increase their deploy, BIG power in space that will take a long time to match.  OOC/TT takes out visage, plus there is Corran *Horn* (yes we cant leave him out, hes our second cousin ;-) ).  Dont forget that if you get Corran to the Executor you can use Path and Narrow Escape.  They wont be able to keep up with your drains and since they cant battle you theyll be hard pressed for anything.  Too bad for them...


Ralops - Tough matchup, but can usually be taken by making good use of your aliens once you flip.  NEVER go to Ralltir.  Get Menace Fades and BP working and youll do fine.  Celebration will be a big deal here, you cant lose Bespin  In fact, we think that if they concentrate wholly on space they have a better chance of winning if they go to ground at all.  So whats the key?  Keep space any way you can.  Rebel Leadership is huge here because of the limiting destiny text.  Csupport will also be huge. 


This Deal - We havent tested against this deck, but wed say you need to start Menace Fades here.  There will be so many sites out that it wont be hard to run around.  Take the opportunity beatdown chance, they might get secure enough in themselves to leave an opening.  As long as you keep Bespin we think the win is easily attainable.


Scum (any type) - This type of QMC rips scum to shreds.  It has been proven time and time again by many players.  Its very easy.  Run away from battles so they cant retrieve and beat you down, then drain them out and force them to pay for what little they have from BP and MF.  Celebration retrieves what little you lose, and Csupport keeps hounding them the entire game.  You may not battle, but youll win.  You usually have 0-10 cards in lost pile by the end of the game.


AOTBS - We had no idea a good version of this existed until the Dark Surgeon, so were not completely sure how a game against it would turn out.  Our best guess is that by running away and keeping Luke on the table you should end up avoiding most of the problems that the Dark Surgeon deals you.


Bring - Give him Luke.  Dont battle.  He cant do anything, game over.


TIES - Deploy ALL your space stuff to Bespin as soon as you flip.  Cannons do nothing against this deck, since you have all capitals, so the only problem is Relentless Pursuit.  Thats why you just stack and stack and stack on bespin.  You should be able to hold out until they lose enough stuff to not be able to come back.  BP is huge here, as is the other side of the Path combo, REVEALED


So Im sure youre asking, how do you deal with Blast Door Controls and Grabbers.  Well honestly, by the time they will have taken all your runaway interrupts from you, they wont have enough force left to get to you.  Too bad for them.  And what will BDC do to you?  Not all that much.  Not many decks are playing it at the moment, and if they do you still have path.  If people decide this deck is worth metaing against, oh well, but it works now


This deck can conceivably beat any dark deck out there *right now*.  Tatooine isnt out yet, so we dont know how this deck will fare after that.  But WHY would you want to play this when Keeping the Empire out Forever is released? ;-) 


God bless,
