Strategy: '

Cloud City Engineer - Convert AC vs. Profit

Death Star - Used for added activation without worrying about Revo

J'Quille - Added beatdown by excluding; also a spy

Strategies
Vs. Any form of Mains - Toughest game since they hardly give you any force, if any. Probably will be using Nabums, so keep those Ootas in hand. Keep a good force at each site so you are pretty well protected from major beatdown. Elis away before the battle (during their deploy phase) if you think they're gonna kill you in battle.

Vs. Hidden Base - Try to capture whatever ground that they might have. Try to get out Zuckuss In Mist Hunter with 4-LOM With... as a passenger. Spread and drain on the ground as much as possible before they flip.

Vs. Numbers - Get out Resistance quick and just drain and occupy those sites. If they aren't using droids, beatdown their characters.

Vs. Testing - Get Bad Feeling out quickly and be wary of Mains beatdown. Play it just like a Mains deck.

Use your best judgement against anything else. '
