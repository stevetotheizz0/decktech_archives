Strategy: '

all u do is get all the chacters in hand ana all the healpers and sites drop play all the healpers and u can get like 14 densiteys and i have gotten my power up to like 120 before. if they go into space then put a coupple o guys on the falcon and gu can get it to like 40-50 power. pray they dont play ghhhk. if u dont kill them in one beat down then nuberan to another site and try do do another one usally u will only have a super huge beatrdown and a lot of littler ones. If u fear space add in anothe falcon and a spril. and reamber this is a fun not compeative deck. thanks if u review i will rturn the favor
