Okay now first off I dont know of anyone who plays RST like this. If there is someone I just never heard of him. What Im trying to say is this is my own idea, and I did not copy this Nightfall strat from anyone else. Sure, WYS sometimes plays Nightfall for Boushh or Corran, but its nothing like this.

The basic strategy is to totally overpower my opponent in the Bunker. Perhaps unnecessarily, many people fear the loss of hand so strongly that they try to cancel/delay the demolition as long as possible. All too often I see vs RST strategy sections that go along the lines of drop maul, mara, and vader there and hold them off. Such a strategy auto-loses to this deck. Free spies + Jedi Presence + Da Droid is just way too much power all at once. Sure, I have to draw alot of cards, but thats whay yoda stew is for (play at the end of my opponents turn). Its not the fastest-starting kind of deck, but its one of the quickest ways to unload everything in a hand and beatdown. 

Spies are Boushh, Corran, Lando, TK-422 (replace with General Han during deploy phase and then pull V-blaster), Blount, Cracken. I know that isnt as many free characters as in my ISB deck (12) but at least Madine can pull Blount and Cracken, which is a nifty way to fortify your site not costing any force.

Boushh and Chewie are the two best personas in this deck. Boushh is an undercover spy first of all, which means I can deploy her (usually for free) undercover and block drains until I am ready to attack, then break her cover during my deploy phase. Chewie, Protector then deploys for a meager 2 force there, can cancel a text, and then if I want to be mean I replace him with Angry Chewie, who then can cancel another gametext (correct me if Im wrong) and has mad power. Tech is Wookiee Strangle; Mad Chewie under Nightfall with the Droid there is power 11, doubled in battle with Jedi Presence is power 22. You get a 24 + destiny versus, say, Mauls pathetic 13 + destiny. Fun stuff. But the best card for Boushh and Chewie by far is Protector. Add two destiny, or, if Boushh is in a battle, play Lose Protector and a copy of Chewie to cancel all attrition and battle damage, even if I win the battle Needless to say, doing so is extremey frustrating for my opponent if they were relying on high attrition, especially when I do it twice in a row Also cancels Wookiee Kisser, which could be useful against speed Deal. For 2 force, these two are by far the most useful characters in my deck.

Like my darkside deck, it isnt too difficult to get extremely high power totals with the spies/Droid/Presence combo.


Battle example
Its me versus lightsaber combat. I have down the Back Door, Bunker, and Deactivate The Shield Generatior. My opponent wants to take and hold the Bunker site so I wont be able to do my thing so he deploys Darth Maul, YA, his double Saber, EPP Vader, the Emperor, and Janus there (okay well maybe this is a bit more than they can usually afford but Im giving an example of how I can win). Anyway, I get at least 14 force so I activate 14 and play Nightfall on Endor. At this point, alot of people make some comment about what does that card do again? Anyways, I slap down a scrapper spy to the Bunker for free. Follow up with Luke or Obiwan for 5 force. My opponent tracked a 7 so he immediately pulls Force Lightning and plays it targeting Luke. I play Sense to cancel. My opponent is no dummy so he plays DODN shield. Fine. Search and deploy Lukes Lightsaber. Slap down Boushh there for free search and deploy Anakins saber, break her cover. Deploy Chewie Protector there for 2. Replace with Mad Chewie and cancel Emperors Gametext. Deploy Corran Horn there for free. Deploy General Madine there for 3, he searches for Colonel Cracken who I deploy there for free. Deploy Lt. Blount there for free from hand. Play Draw Their Fire. Initiate a battle for 1, retrieve 1 and they lose 1. First action play Jedi Presence for 1. Opponent responds by swinging at Chewie with Vaders Saber, he hits with a 6 and a 3. Then he plays Sniper/Dark Strike for 1 force to make Chewie immediately lost. I lose 2 force from used pile to Sense and cancel. Chewie is hit, forfiet = 0. Now I use 2 force to play Wookiee Strangle, targeting Maul. Draw destiny and hes busted. Opponent plays You Are Beaten targeting Chewie, but has no other actions in the battle. I swing at Vader twice, hitting him on the second try. We each add one destiny to power only I draw a 3, my opponent a 4. My two battle destiny are 1 and 3, and my opponents is a 6. My total power is 63 with 4 attrition. My opponents total power is 22 with 6 attrition. I lose Chewie and Madine, my opponent forfiets Vader, Emperor, and Janus and takes 27 battle damage.
I know that alot of things could have gone differently in that battle but I think its representative of what frequently happens. 


Specific cards

Lando W/Axe I choose over Screamin Lando. Though he isnt a rebel, hes a spy which means alot to me. His weapon isnt too shabby.

Draw Their Fire is in there largely as anti-Ghhhk tech, since my deck relies largely on dealing battle damage.

TK-422 is good for being replaced by General Han, but hes also good just for his undercover abilities. Gives me time to draw a large hand and attack.

Wookiee Strangle can also choke an undercover Arica if my power is high enough.

Yoda Stew is really nifty for my style of play. Right before they end their turn (or before they battle you) play it to give yourself 4 extra force. Im huge on drawing a monster hand, so this card suits me perfectly. If Protector didnt suck up their monster attrition, the lost function could also plausibly, since Im more about power than battle destiny. Having 4 more force to deploy and battle with is also good for my one-turn emptying of my hand.


Weaknesses
Crush The Rebellion/EvaderMonnok Man I hate this card combo. They really need to change this because it totally screws me over. Well, not totally, because I can grab the card, and I always do, but its still ridiculously annoying against me because of my large hands. Drop also is annoying but at least I can Alter it.


Matchups

This deck doesnt school every decktype, but rather the concept comes as a surprise to those who dont know me, and I rely more on dealing battle damage than your typical deck. The drains are mediocre, and I know most people play IAO, but the battling potential makes up for that. At the very least, I have great fun with this deck.

Endor Ops Okay well Ive never seen anyone actually play this deck but Id imagine if they play Ephant Mon I would have to move everyone into the bunker. I dont really see this being a tough matchup because its my home turf and when I blow the bunker theyre really screwed.

Dark Deal Okay, well Im going to have to attack them, preferably attack and blow up the bunker in either order. What really helps (and they should do this if they are a good deck) is when the pull Bespin system. I have problems against my friends who know that Bespin on table means instant death (well, almost) for them, so they just forget the free Executor and CC Occupation and drain with IAO. Basically, Nightfall on Bespin and attack without the droid, it should work, but if Im playing against my friends I usually try to blow up the bunker and get there during my move phase and try to put down undercover spies. Its tricky, but Dark Deal is a beast. If you really hate Deal then replace Sorr Kal Faas for Squassin and put in Outrider, RS1, etc. and Menace Fades. Good thing Will stopped playing no-system Deal against me.

Court This deck doesnt really deal that much damage quickly so go for a bunker blow as soon as you are confident. 99% of the time they will come after you and thats when you nail them with crazy battle damage, or just clear them out and blow away the bunker. Nabrun to Tatooine to finish them off or alternatively drain for a bit on Endor and play Boushh and TK.

Hunt Down Well, it seems no one wants to play Hunt Down against me for some reason... no one seems to play it when I want a game, but I know its deadly. If they are playing dueling then protect Luke etc with SAC in the beginning or go for a quick explosion if possible. More likely they are going for beatdowns, but this is an easier version to play against; calmly draw your hand and get what you need, Snipe Dr. E, deploy to the bunker en masse with crazy power, win the battle there, finish off with Nabrun, drains, spies, if possible. If they play IAO its still feasible to invade with Nabrun.

Senate/SCYFA TIEs Okay well I dont know what Id do to stop this one... go for an early explosion, max out the drains with lightsabers, strangle snipe and corran their undercovers, and hope to win. Aim High of course. If they come to the ground to try to annoy you make sure you dont let them get away without taking massive battle damage.

ISB Well, if its my ISB deck, its a really interesting battle, but that never happens unless I am playing against my brother and he is using my deck. ISB space use same strategy versus TIEs. Not an easy matchup, but not as good as TIEs in my opinion. No one plays this around here.

Combat Well hopefully this deck wont use IAO, though sometimes it does. If they do, blow away the bunker, get your massive hand, then drop two jedi to Back Door and drain for awhile. When its getting towards the endgame Nabrun over to the docking bay and let them combat one of your jedi but disrupt them as much as possible (or battle them if they are foolish enough to let you). If they played IAO and didnt play the docking bay then you know they are either dumb or they did that because they already knew what my deck was somehow. In any case, the more likely scenario is they will be lured into the Endor Bunker by the threat of losing 8 force and their hand (which isnt that big a deal really but people think it is). Completely destroy them if they make this common mistake.   '
