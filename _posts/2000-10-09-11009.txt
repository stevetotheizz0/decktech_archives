Strategy: 

Try to get Admiral Chireaneau and Ominous Rumors down by your third turn. Use Imperial Command to get out the admirals quickly. Then use Piett to get our Merrejk and use him to get out systems for drains. Get out Kuat or Wakeelmui with Mobil. Points first turn and then get the matching effect ASAP. Put Chireaneau on a SD at Mon Calamari so he can effect your drains at most places. The AT-STs will slow down the opponent on the ground. Try to keep a Battle Deployment on the table at all times to help get out your Tempests. If your opponent has a strong space force then you must be quick about overpowering. If the opponent plays Combined Fleet Action then strengthen two or three systems with a mix of sabers and SDs. Don’t be afraid of big drains just attempt to drain them for more faster. You only need down four or five SDs to do alright.
This isn’t a perfect deck and I would like any suggestions you have to offer. Thanks for reading this.
