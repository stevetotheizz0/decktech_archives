Strategy: '

Get your Endor sites out as quickly as possible.  In my opinion, Endor is the best planet, because the sites provide wonderful activation and 4 sites allow you to force drain for 2 or more. Get Vader down on one of the sites soon to, so you will no longer lose to Visage.  Get rid of everyting they play with the Senses and Alters.  The rest of the deck is pretty self-explanatory.

Techs against certain decks

Ops drop your guys down, and kill them. You can stay there and drain, or go back to Endor via Elis Herlot.

Hidden Base Start with Security Precautions, and probe like wild with your two starships.  With security precautions, they should do fine.

Revo Alter their Revos, or you can use your Evaders.  Either way, they are dead.

Techs on certain cards

Tempest Scout 6 Just a good card.  Can deploy for 1 as a react, and is power 4 at Forest Clearing.

Imperial Supply Another good card that can always be useful.

There'll Be Hell To Pay Grab whatever card is helping them the most.

Imperial Barrier It's always nice to hold back that Obi-wan, 1 turn.	'
