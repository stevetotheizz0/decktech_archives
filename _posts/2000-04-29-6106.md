<<<<<<<<<<
If you can't read the deck list, then do not rate it.	My decks always end up like that b/c this site will not allow webtv users to type up the deck right.  Thanks.>>>>>>>>>>


This deck is really good.  Use the normal start and use Tunnel Visions to get your needed cards. Park the Super Falcon at Kessel and drain like crazy.	If they do try to battle you, then take out their ships with the 3 battle destiny.  Put the Legendary starfighter on the falcon for direct damage.

The only deck I thought I would have trouble with was SFS, but with the limited force they get the ties will not have a chance.

Please leave constructive reviews.  Thanks.  '
