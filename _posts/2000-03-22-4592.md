Strategy: '

This is a preety simple deck. get out raithal so your troppers are destiny +2 then you all the isb troopers in the deck(all but 3 are troopers) to drain and insert with.in space you have the cannon that will imediatly kill the falcon and the destiny in this deck is all right so it could happen. Of course their is a smacking crew to smack the unwary barty of twas khaa and some punk or something. Also there is 5d6 and abc to help against ops. ops is the deck this will have most problems against so some decrees might want to be thrown and with your objective fliped... that does spell disaster for oppoenent dosen't it? Well this deck is made apon whats being played in my region and ops dosen't show up that much. not much else to say um your destiny for the insert should be as high as 15 with three trooper isb or as low as 12 with 2 and 5d6. Thats about all. '
