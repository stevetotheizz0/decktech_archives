Strategy: '

I just want to thank Mike Ravelling for the idea, his deck is truly awesome.

Greetings,

This is my Ls Type II that i am going to use,

Basically, it restricts opponent away from tatooine, if they deploy maul he is going to be stuck on tatooine, this deck can very easily take the senate and cause much damage to watto and senate, with this deck you should be very able to crush your opponent,


First turn you should initiate the race and pull your docking bay and I Did It. Get Yoda out and if your opponent is playing senate get palpatine with might of the republic, make good use of your interrupts so that you can kill your opponent on any deck. winning the race should not be difficult cause if you are not going to cancel the card with podracer collision you are going to be able to sense it. Basically you set up your dudes at the docking bay, and wait for you opponents to attack you, against watto objective, take mos espa out and stick to your dbs and against senate laugh as you can control the senate quite easily. 


cheers

Matt Mohl
