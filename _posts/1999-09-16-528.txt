Strategy: 

See the original version of this deck for the main strategy. I'll just go over the changes I made.

First off, due to consensus two main courses were added, seeing that FA/DTF could slaughter this deck.

Added more HB protection: extra <>Docking Bay, Tarkin's Orders, and starting with Imperial City instead of Coruscant.. It just seemed that HB could be a real problem if they flip early.

Added another Imperial Decree because of the overall importance of this card in the deck

Sunsdown added for Ops decks. Same thing with 5D6.

Secret Plans to help against regen-type decks.

I decided against adding a Broken Concentration. If you can get a speedy set-up, you should be able to kill them before they can do anything to you.

Most of the cards taken out were from the ISB agent area and I took out a few interrupts/effects. I realized I wouldn't need so many ISB agents when I was retrieving them.

Any questions, just send me a message via Decktech. Thanks!
