Strategy: 

This deck is impressignly strong. I generally start with Death Star and Imp Arrest Order but vary with what an opponents starts (Security Pre. for HB Bright Center for Ops). This deck is capable of holding its own in space or ground thanks to the wonderful 'scrubs' of the Empire. These wonderful faithful servants of the empire generally pack the forfeit of a LS main with Arrest Order out. Slap em on a Walker and they wont be touched by a saber..leaving them with their beefy bonus. Works the same way in space. I threw the sacrifice in as an emergency precaution..never know when youll need to have your people outside and viable to be hit. The deck is fast and merciless...Battle Order normally slows the opponent down and it shouldnt affect you with the 2 big K's and Endor out(Or even POTF on the Death Star). In any event as long as you play smart you should be able to beat most decks.
