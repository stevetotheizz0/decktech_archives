Strategy: '

Okay, the first thing I want to get across is a disclaimor, this deck is not a copy of Hidden Mains Done RIGHT, so I am going to be unhappy if someone decides to mark me down because of it

that being said, on to the strategy

first turn decide whether to draw Endor or Dagobah/Yodas Hut (whether either is in your reserve deck will be an obvious factor) and Home One Docking Bay, but its probably not a good idea to put down some scrub for activation, unless youre really feeling confident (playing vs a scrub, and you have a Fallen Portal, the scrub is Tawss Khaa)
second turn just pull out another docking bay plus the system you didnt pull last turn, you activated 8 this turn (assuming Dagobah) so you may want to put down some people at a docking bay that would really hold it down, but again, you may not want to, theres no rush at all, next turn, youll get another 11 force, and you can work with that

thats the start, well then, what makes this deck any different from your average Mains and Toys? well, those activation numbers are the primary difference and second, there are no obligations to deploy first, so you can be much more offensive and beat Dark Side decks at their own game, while retrieving tons of force

I better get to some card explanations
Corulag - this card is switched with Endor when playing against Endor Ops, they already have Endor out, and Strike Planning doesnt do anything, so pull Corulag for more activation instead of converting their Endor, or have a floating 0

No Generals? - the only general Im considering is Crix Madine, and he cant do much in this deck, the only other options would be to switch out some Lando or Han personas, and I dont feel like doing that

Is 2 ships enough? - well, two ships isnt much in a Hidden Base deck, but they happen to be the 2 strongest of all LS ships, theyll do just fine, their primary purpose is to combat Ties or Endor Ops, but also to punish Hunt Down or BHBM if they decide to try and hold their Rendilli or Carida

Your Insight Serves You Well? - although Im not using the super sweet immune to sense Signal tech, this card is still good, a guy in my area still plays numbers, but you may want to switch it for a Courage or Glancing Blow to help combat your meta

Wait a second, what cards do you track? - thats one of the main points about this deck, it doesnt use Fall Of The Legend or Throw Me Another Charge, instead, its got 4 easily recyclable destiny 5s, and theyre much less likely to get grabbed, also, these will actually help you in the game, not just reveal your reserve deck to your opponent (can anyone tell I dont like Fall Of The Legend?)

okay, Ill go on to strategies against certain decktypes now

Endor Ops - one of your more complex games, but also one that is not that hard, because you can handle their ground and their space (just deploy en masse) use Endor as your Hidden Base and pull Corulag, also, you might want to start with Your Insight instead of Strike Planning

Hunt Down - still one of the most powerful decktypes out there, and Im admittedly not packing any duel protection or TTs, thats probably the first things I want to add, after a Weapon Levitation, anyway, you may want to start some damage early by securing Endor, but the key here is to stay calm under the pressure from Visage while getting your combos and retrieval together, SAC what you can, of course, but this is probably your hardest matchup, as always, little tricks like Fallen Portaling Mara Jade are always welcome )

BHBM - this is probably one of your most straightforward matchups, as this is probably the single most popular decktypes out there, this deck takes that into acount, however, Im not going to lie to you and say I always beat BHBM, its a very strong deck (strong enough for me to play one myself) so anyway, hit and run with EPP Luke if you can, and try to determine their SAC load, youre going to take your time with this one, but go ahead and give them Jedi Luke if Vader comes down, you may also try to retake Luke, if you have the cards and the force for a head on battle

Ties - surprisingly, one of the easier matchups, start drawing and Tunneling for ships and pilots, then solidly take over Wakeelmui, assuming they used SYCFA, take the DS system if you think you can spread out (Home One at Wakeelmui, Super Falcon at DS)

Scum in general - a really good Scum deck is probably your hardest matchups, simply because they can beat you at your own game, this is a particularly complex battle, as you want to wait before deploying and quickly take over the Audience Chamber as well, Ben and Lando are gods in this game, Tunnel for them and use them wisely

Dark Deal/ISB - These decks dont stand much of a chance, you can out battle and out retrieve them, your only trouble would be somebody copying Sokols World Champion ISB, as you dont have much of a fighting chance in a sandstorm, but dominate space effectively, and play pretty aggresively and the game will be yours

Im looking for some constructive criticism here, Im trying to add some Duel protection or at least one TT, so let me know what you think

thank you  '
