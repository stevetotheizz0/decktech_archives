Strategy: '

i have play with another version of this deck in day 2 of the world champion0ship(3 place) and into team event(3 place)

in the first turn you have to draw all the card you activate to be able to run into your entire deck on turn 3.
after that you can out of commision is entire lost pile turn after turn make Oola to stop is deploy, insert im to death and retrive when you need it(come here be coward dont stop this deck because occupy your 2 battleground)
if deploy POW beetdown after the big POW you can still insert because is not suppose to have charater on the ground( in theory)
and for space it could bo worse and retrive you still have a drain of 2 at the hologameboard

have fun killing people with this deck and sorry for my english( i speek french)
