Power Of The Hut
*This Effect varies depending on what kind of deck you play.  If you are playing space then start YCHF, which you use to pull Search and Destroy.  If it is a Harvest deck or Edging deck then use SSPFT.  With anything else you don&#8217;t have to start a third effect.  You can also start First Strike, although I like saving it for a surprise.

I normally pull Jabba with the AC&#8217;s game text and then I get out Ark Rev with him.  Next turn I fetch Greeata.  Then I use Greeata to pull Dodo Bodanawieedo (also a Rodian) and use Ak-rev to pull musicians.  I continue to build in my hand a large beat-down force and then hammer them.  Unless they stay off of the ground them I just drain them and hit them with direct damage (Search and Destroy, Ability^3, Court objective).  Make sure that you use all of your cool musician&#8217;s game texts.  Some of them do some really nice stuff.  The beatdown power of this deck is immense.  I once make a kid lose 72 for power!  Normally, your big beat results in a 30-50 card loss, thus ending the game.  You opponent will never see it coming.  And those who don&#8217;t believe me all I can say is  don&#8217;t knock it until you try it!

Reason for starting COTVG and not MKOS or CCT: 
I like the direct damage potential of the deck, the ability to pull starships and the fact that COTVG pulls 1/0 DBs from reserve.

Answers to potential questions:

Why only 3 ships?

You may thing that I need more ships, but I have done fine with 3.  I have beaten many space decks including a WYS Kessel Running deck.  In that game I actually ended up defeating most of his ships.  Add another ship if you want, not too many kids my area play space.

Don&#8217;t you need more force for such a big beat down?

This deck doesn&#8217;t need a lot of force to get going. With your musicians being deploy -2 each (Greeata and Scum) you can drop such a big beat-down that after the shock wears off your opponent will be saying, &#8220;What Hit Me!?&#8221;

Cards to Add:

-Oota Goota Solo?:  It stinks when you pile all of your characters down only to have your opponent Nabrun away.

-Monnok:  I think that most decks should play with at least one.  I couldn&#8217;t find the room.

No Escape:  Honor stinks so if it is big in your area then put it in.

Oppressive Enforcement/There Is No Try: Nice against Sense and Alter.  Although SAC isn&#8217;t big in my area.

Card Explanations:

-Barrier:  It is to protect the AC and to allow you to lure them to a site.  Then the next turn you bring a massive beat-down.

-Control/SFS:  With this deck it is a nice card.  Use it in combination with Dodo to look and organize your destinies and SFS without missing.  Then obviously, the first part is self-explanatory.

-Masterful Move:  This card is in there to cancel Mantalian Savrip.

-Broken Concentration:  Use this card in combination with First Strike to make it so they can&#8217;t play Houjix or Rite Of Passage, exc.

-Blastdoor Controls:  Cancels Rebel Barrier and Narrow Escape.  A must for this deck.


Matchups: 

vs. Profit: 
Practically auto-win. They will be forced to commit characters to the ground, and that is where you smash them. Start Ak-rev and Jabba. 

vs. HB space (any variant), EBO XWings, EBO: 
Don&#8217;t ditch You Cannot Hide Forever until you are absolutely certain that they are not playing odds.  Use your ships wisely. Keep in mind also that your musicians are each forfeit 5-6 with Greeata at the AC. Use YCHF to get Search and Destroy from reserve as necessary. 

vs. MWYHL: 
Get your direct damage rolling ASAP. Not a really hard matchup if you play it right. It is all about the speed of your setup. The fact that MWYHL decks give you a few icons to work with definitely helps here. Don&#8217;t pre-maturely deploy all of your musicians.. Save some for the beats just in case the opponent comes to the ground. 

vs. Rebel Strike Team: 
They deploy guys to the ground, you deploy more powerful stuff for cheaper, therefore you win.  Just wait till they more to the bunker and them BAM!

vs. TIGIH: 
Don&#8217;t drop Mara unless they drop someone else with Luke. The best thing to do is save for a beat-down and beat down Luke.

vs. Tatooine Mains/Harvesting and Messing:
This is a tougher match up if they are ready for you.  If they don&#8217;t see it coming then you can probably catch a lone Qui-Gon for a good beating.  Make sure to start SSPFT.

Here is what each of the musicians do:

Ak-Rev: Subtracts 1 from attrition against you at same site. Once during each of your control phases, may use 1 Force to take one musician into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. 

Greeata: Other Rodians deploy -1 to same site. Once during each of your control phases, may use 1 Force to take any Rodian into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. While at Audience Chamber, all your other musicians are deploy -1 and forfeit +3. 

Lyn Me: Subtracts 1 from deploy cost of bounty hunters at same site (Boba Fett deploys free). During battle, subtracts X from opponent&#8217;s total power, where X = number of your musicians present (+2 if battling Luke or Han, or +4 if both). 

Nizuc Bec (not a musician, but important): Power +3 when present with your musician. When present at start of a battle, may cause one opponent&#8217;s character of ability < X to move away for free (or that character is immediately lost), where X = the number of your musicians present. 

Rappertunie: Where present, adds X to Force opponent must use to initiate battle, where X = number of musicians present. May target one non-droid character present in battle. Draw destiny. If destiny > defense value, target is power = 0 this battle. 

Rystall: Power and forfeit +2 at a Coruscant site. May retrieve 1 Force each time you deploy a musician to same site. Once during each of your turns, may use 1 Force to &#8217;charm&#8217; one male of ability < 3 present; male is forfeit = 0 for remainder of turn. 

Umpass-Stay: Spy. Power +2 at a Jabba&#8217;s Palace site. Each of your other musicians at same site is power +2 and immune to attrition < 3. Immune to attrition < 4.

Enjoy and tell me some of your big beat stories, I would love to hear them.  Thanks for your reviews and please give helpful comments if you have something to say about fixing the deck or whatever.
