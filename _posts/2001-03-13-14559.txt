Strategy: 

What this deck does is set up at the Death Star and Executor (via Presence), and establish some high damage (Lose 2 to the Objective, 4 more from Vigo Enhanced-drains, and possibly 1 more from S&D) waiting for your opponent to come and battle you...and thats when the fun begins.

First of all, this is going to be a somewhat long strategy section as Agents of the Black Sun really isnt played that much. If you think youve already got a good feel of how this deck works, Rate Away! If not, read on.

General Tech:
Plan plan plan plan! Cant stress that enough. To fully use the flipside of this deck, you need to know what you plan to do in your deploy, battle, and draw phase. 
Battle battle battle battle! You want to cause as much battle damage as possible. Like it says above, set up your damage, but still go looking for fights, dont run!
Track track track track! This is hard for most players, including me (I lost a game against Douglas Harvilla because of 1 poorly timed ”On the Edge”), but, this deck makes it easy and you wont win if you cant track...to some extent.

Particular Tech:
Get Xixor to the C:DB first turn and Carida from deck for good second turn activation. Move him to the DS:DB for a (hopefully) second turn flip...hell, even if its not a flip, move him there anyway. 

Once flipped, start using the ”Once Per Turn, may place a card from hand in used pile to peek at cards in force pile” as a Janus, a Tunnel Vision, and a Reactor Terminal. Start setting up your destinys for battles, see whats in your force pile, and get rid of duplicates. Start setting up your hand too. If you need that card that is 5 cards down in your force pile, find some way to use that 5 force...then draw it. Or, if you need to stack high destiny for battles, start putting back MM, Twi’Lek, SHUOSHD, etc. and now you have 5s and 6s set up that your opponent hasnt seen you play.

Really abuse the ”Once during each of your battle phases, may peek at top X cards of any reserve deck, where X = number of locations you occupy” True, this may only be like 2-3 cards, but it helps...big time. Never look at your opponents deck as you cant change that, always use it on yours to know when to do what in a battle such as Detonating a Thermal Detonator, playing Hidden Weapons, Vibro Axe, play WDYTM, etc.

Card Tech:
Put All Sections on Alert: Great battle card to be used both Offensively and Defensively. Use it to protect Xixor from EPPs, or too really srew your opponent in a battle.

Why Didnt You Tell Me: Pure and simple, Make Luke Pay! Also good if you can capture Luke during battle. (made easy by VOFDP).

Resistance: Anti-EBO. Stick a Presence on C:DB, E:DB, get to those 2 bays plus DS for cancellation of mass drainage.

Thermal Detonator: Great way to kill Jedi Luke...or anybody! Just track whatever destiny you need with VOTDP

Counter Assault:Since you can use the Force pile thing on your opponents turn too, you can stack 3 high destiny cards before their next drain. Good against a lot of stuff.

Deck Tech: 

WYS:
Ignore space, get set up at DS and Executor, wait for them. Soon, take over the Cantina with whoever (with a well-tracked Detonator, its easy), and battle/capture their scrubs. Wait for a Luke-Beatdown, and even Counter Assault their drains. Grab whatever you feel hurts you the most (FP, Harevst, etc.) although I usually go for portal.

Hidden Base:
Set up at all 3 Docking Bays with S&D for a total of 5 in drains, 2 from the Objective, and 2 from Search and Destroy. Then, start probing with fodder and/or a Ghhk.

Profit:
Start whatever bounty-hunter aliens you want (doesnt really matter), then just battle and use your captureing to win battles and ultimately, the game, but make sure First Strike and Blast Door Controls are out.

Mains and Toys:
Any variant, auto-win. Really. They will have to come battle you to deal damage, and with PASOA working in conjunction with the rest of your tech, this game is no problem.

TIGIH:
Actually youre toughest match. Keep Luke away from the Emperor, try and make him come to you so you can play PASOA or Sniper, or WDYTM to make battles swing your way. If this is hot in your area, add in a ”Always Thinking with your Stomach.”

Agents in the Court:
Speeders would be tough...try for a really good timed Counter Assualt and then battle as best you can, but a tough matchup. Otherwise, just battle, non-unique aliens have little to no chance against your hunters and their tech, seriously, they dont. Just dont leave yourself open for a huge swarm beatdown, and watch for a devastating Counter Assault.

Weelll, thats all the strategy you should need to win, good luck and have fun with this deck. Later.
