Strategy: '

the effects are key
expand Spaceport City for higher drains on 3 sites

Imperial Decree combined with the obj flipped is devastating
Bad Feeling Have I combined with the obj is devastating

make sure to have Imperial Arrest Order out

get Bubo out with Swamp
i dont know what else to say, its a strong deck
usually i add more Vaders but RTP hurts that

the reason i like this deck is because im sick of HDADTJ.  i like playing LS much more

RESPONSES---------------------------------------------------
Oppressive Enforcement is my other start card
sadfully Imperial Commanders are the only generic Imperial leaders
PotF helps me get force fast because od Twilek Advisor
