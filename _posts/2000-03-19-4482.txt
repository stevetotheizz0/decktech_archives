Strategy: '

The basic strategy behind this deck is to pull out your sites, put ops on the AT-STs to protect them and drain. A couple inserts to help you out as well.

Vs. Profit Start IAO. Don't bother with the aliens at the beginning. Concentrate on draining. When they flip, Send Blizzard 2 or some unused scouts down to Tatooine with AT-ST pilots to trample guys and annoy them. Use Vader if necessary, otherwise insert odds for a loss of 6 each time.

Vs. HB Start Security Prec. Get lots of drains in as early as possible while you gather up your ships. If they flip, just start flying around and probing. If they dont flip, drain for a while, and then drop a beatdown when they have only a few cards in hand. Imp Barrier any threatening ships after that.

Vs. Ops The beauty about this deck is that it can fight if it has to. Because they are most likely gonna be fairly weak on power, set up a few drains then drop the scouts with pilots on their planet and beat up ops. They wont be able to run too far even on speeders because of your scouts' landspeed of 3.

Basically just try and drain the opponent out and insert for added force loss. Good luck. '
