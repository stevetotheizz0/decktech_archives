Strategy: '

You start Obi-Wan's Hut and Careful Planning to pull Tosche Station.  If you see CCT, use The Signal to pull Scrambled Transmission.  If you see TIEs go Careful Planning to get Tosche, against Hunt Down get Goo Nee Tay and start searching for your duel protection.  Time your battles right to inflict the most damage.  Be aggressive with this deck, it works.'
