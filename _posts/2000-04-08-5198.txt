Strategy: '

The basic idea is to set up a good drain on Dagobah.  Use ithorians to enhance your drains.  Also, retrieve with on the edge.  Use electrobinoculars to find the bionic hands on top of your deck, then call six and draw the seven and retrieve 6 force each time.  If you lose a bionic hand, use the bargwin to retrieve it.  If they drop CHYBC, play a few enhanced people at the cantina and a few ships at Kessel.	If you lost Kessel, then deploy at systems they have out.  If they have a destroyer use the landing claw and then dtach during your control phase(so you occupy) and you can drain and retrieve.  If you dont need epp han or epp leia to fight the CHYBC, then use Boushh and TK422 to stop their drains.  This deck should win by a lot. '
