Strategy: '

The deck starts with HB and Insurrection, but is primarily a ground deck (I almost always start Insurrection, but will use Wise Advice against a known SAC player and Battle Plan against Operatives).  If the opponent wastes his starting interrupt to pull Security Precautions, all the better
Use the objective to pull Tatooine and Tibrin for early force generation, but don't deploy Alderaan until later in the game  Your opponent will quickly realize you're playing ground once you set up shop on Tatooine, so you want OMDH to come as a surprise later in the game.
There are 2 spies and 1 Transmission Terminated to deal with HDADTJ, which is the deck of choice in Central Texas.  Lots of people like to duel, so Courage and Glancing Blow are also must haves.  With the release of ECC and EJP, I've added Eject Eject to deal with Boba in Slave I.  I may add another, but deck space is tight.

This deck is a variation on my old Harvest deck, but I've found Celebration to be a more reliable retrieval engine.  Tibrin is nice if you lose a vital card to a force drain, or to retrieve OMDH near the end of the game.

Comments are welcomed.	This deck is strong against most deck types, but can struggle against a dedicated space deck. '
