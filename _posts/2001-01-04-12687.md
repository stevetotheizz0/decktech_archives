Strategy: 

ok.....stratagies....simple play it same everytime

set up endor & defend with minimum.......then when he battle deploy you’re 4 power free ewok’s as a react....crush him & keep draining.

ewoks get mad drains(tessek,graak,ithorians) & tattooine just leave off & set up the gift & make him loose a few more from profit....& also the saber

OK I DONT REALLY CARE WHAT YOU THINK OF THE DECK  MOST YOU PEOPLE CANT JUDGE A DECK ANYHOW MY BEST DECK HAS @#$% RATING WHILE MY @#$% ONE HAS GOOD RATING........

i dont mean to be an ass...........not meat for some retard to give it a 1, i just use decktech to store my decks.......anyhow this deck should be getting 4 or 3’s     aint a great deck	just wanted to take it apart so posted it
