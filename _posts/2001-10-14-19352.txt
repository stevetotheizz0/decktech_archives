OK this isnt speed deal but everythings here for a reason...

This is basically an older school version of dark deal Bounty HUnters on ground retrieving force through those pesky bounties Vader And Maul there to back them up...

Set it up quickly or else you are going to have a hard time doing it later... In space you got starfighters for some serious damage dealing Then you got Chimera which when it enters a phone booth becomes.... SUPER CHIMERA!!! Heres the formula:

CHimera
Grand Admiral Thrawn
Captain Gilead Pellaeon
Guri

This is just the perfect arrangement Two destinies for you limit them to one...

Ok now some key card decisions...

Blaster Rack - I know you are shocked to see this bit of tech... but it helps you when you only have one of each saber... It lets you get them back asap to where they are needed...

Snoova and his axe - He simply rocks... HE CAN CAPTURE JEDI LUKE EASILY!!! and quigon and all those other pesky jedi... and swing a battle into your favor... just remember he can only do so much... capture jedi luke, but send rebel scout luke to the used pile... see the difference im stating put low destinies into the reserve deck to limit them... even if it does increase life force

Bounty Hunter weapons - WHy not... They help out with a tough job... Dengar and his riot gun will help you to capture even jedi when they are getting troublesome... Boba fetts blaster rifle will go after low ability chars and with evazan at the site you clear them away before they get a chance to hurt you...

Alright i will definately make amends to this deck as i work it into a perferct tool so tell me what you think!
