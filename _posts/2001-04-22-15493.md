Strategy: '

 


		Ok, mainly this deck was made on a wimb, trying to find a way to combat the serious amount of new DS decks out there , including Big Blue, the new effect now gonna make SYCFA big, TIE swarm , huntdown, BHBM, and the serious amount of kck @$$ going into DS Jabbas Palace in general. So, I came up with this prelim deck. It uses Hidden Base for Dagobah Ã   Hut, and Tatooine cuz its priceless in this deck.. 


		So, I start Hidden Base with Rendezvous Point, because in my last deck, generation was a HUGE problem. 


		The main objective also in this deck is to get Tat Celebration up and running. In this decks first game, it managed to retrieve 9 per turn with a combination of Harvest, Tat Celeb, and Reflection ( which I m still debating to put back in here, gimme some input) So, use Dash, Han, and Mirax/Wedge to hold Tat and get as many Tat sites armed to the teeth as you can.


		Some other things that are important to this deck


1)	Getting out Supa Falcon should not be a problem, cuz with two Capt. Hans and EPP Leia;s, Falcon is out in thestart, and than get Outrider, Skate etc&#8230; to keep Tat. Celeb. Running and to keep the AO juicing yer drains. 

2)	THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THIS DECK I know this could be labeled a Harvest deck, but do not rely on Harvest for the game. SSPFT, Plans, and Grabbers are the bane of this deck. Grabbers and SSPFT especially, because it defeats the purpose of playing multiple Harvest, so Tat. Celebration will have do the work after the Harvest have expired. 

3)	Don&#8217;t forget that Harvest has that wee alternate text, only that it adds 2 destiny with Luke / Owen-Beru. Never forget that. The enemy will never see it coming.

4)	Don&#8217;t forget about Goo Nee Tay after you&#8217;ve deployed it. It can cost you the game.

5)	And finally, don&#8217;t forget your playing 2 Dbays ,and the AO gives you drain +1 at dbays related to systems you occupy. 



Strategies vs. Dex 


Vs. SYCFA Ties Swarm

	The first Signal you get, whip out I Hope Shes Alright. Its gold vs. this deck, and it can help a lot. Keep Tatooine fortified, watch out for Unreal Cannon, that one that&#8217;s makes them lost. (Damn) and you may want to slip a few A Few Maneuvers for the cannon protect and the destiny.


Vs. Huntdown

	Interesting game. Get out TT/Ooc for that Visage, watch out for This Is Some Rescue and keep all your sites protected. ONLY DEPLOY THE SITES YOU CAN PROTECT. Fight the fights that must be fought, but don&#8217;t be foolish.


Vs. BHBM

	I don&#8217;t know about throwing a scout Luke just for this deck, even though its big in my meta, but givem Luke early, although this will greatly reduce your character base.

PLEASE GIVE ME SOME IDEAS FOR SOME CHARCTERS IN THIS DECK WHOSE PERSONAS I DON&#8217;T HAVE IN HERE ALREADY AND DON&#8217;T SUGGEST WYS BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SMUGGLERS TO RUN THIS DECK OTHER THAN RAIDERS.	


Vs. MKOS/Court

	Until Tatooine comes out (and The Camp) theres really nothing you can do against this deck, so do the best you can because DS Jabba&#8217;s Palace is just too good. They can swarm guys for 1 force or free, and the power is overwhelming.


Vs. ISB/ISB Scum

	Haven&#8217;t had the pleasure of playing this deck, its not big in my meta, so I&#8217;ll get back to ya on that 1. 






Set me Dmail with any ideas Thanks
