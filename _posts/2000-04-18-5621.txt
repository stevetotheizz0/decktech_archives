Strategy: '

Just realized I left out a card-Echo Base Docking Bay

I'm starting with MWYHL for SAC protection and activation, not to mention the Yoda/Yoda's Hut combo.
Insurrection is to boost 14 characters' forfeit and to prevent Elis beatdowns, along with getting out all the docking bays.
All of the non-insurrection characters can draw battle destinies by themselves.
The Ithorian is in there for force drain bonuses at Endor.
Skiffs are for landspeed and reacting
Now that I think of it, Nabrun isn't very useful
Quite A Mercinary is if I don't want their beatdown crew coming over
I'll put another Noble Sacrifice into my deck when I get one, they're especially good with Insurrection
So is Mantellian Savrip
Scramble is good against many decks
Ultimatum vs. Inserts

Please be constructive in your reviews.
Thanx
