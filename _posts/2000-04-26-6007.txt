Strategy: '

Just a post to stay in active mode

Notes

No SAC protection, because its not common in my region
Almost no numbers protection, because nobody plays dark side numbers

The plan

use your good activation to get the mains out and bsh the dark side
the cycling destinies will provide good draws...


cheers

I finshed 3rd on the german national with this deck
