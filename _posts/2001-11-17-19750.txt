Strategy: 

 
This is my second version of tatooine mains

First turn pull audience chamber and deploy any other sites for activation and either deploy characters, hopefully a maul for free to the landing site, or you can draw cards, imperial barrier is to protect you from beatdowns and you are beaten to exclude a character from battle, maul strikes for adding battle destiny or to get his double bladed lightsaber from reserve deck

Try and get expand the empire on the audience chamber, get the other sites from reserve deck and deploy 3 aliens and get hutt influence so they can`t cancel or modify your force drains, theres 2 we must accelerate our plans to get out your effects, one of the aliens to deploy is GALLID from reserve deck cause he makes force drains +1 at jabbas palace sites

All the lightsabers and presences and gallid and janus greejatus is all stuff to enhance your force drains and the opponent can`t cancel them, you&#8217;ve got some real power in space, some really hard independent starships, chimaira and grand admiral thrawn, and lateral damage to make one of their starships power 0 and there is the endor system to drain at

The defensive shields, there is no try for protection against sense and alter, podracing to cut the damage down, allegations to grab one of their interrupts, if they play watch your step with palace raiders play wipe them out all of them, here are a few matchups

vs watch your step
get your sites out and put maul to the landing site for free, use cards like imperial barrier on luke or other characters to slow them down, play a useless gesture defensive shield, if they play 
a lost interrupt and they have 3 smugglers on table its placed out of play, guri stops adding battle destiny, drain battle and lots of space power to kick them off tatooine

vs echo base operations or hidden base
If you know they don`t play ground put one charcter to a site get gallid from reserve deck, drain them out quickly, if they play ground set up usually, play cards like imperial barrier and you are beaten and kick them off, secret plans makes them pay to retrieve force, drain them out,  theres quite a lot of space force to beat them up in some places

vs podprofit
using their objective deploy mara jade and snoova to the audience chamber, first turn deploy their weapons and back them up with a charcter, secret plans out straight away to slow down the retrieving,  play stunning leader to exclude their mains from battle, drain battle and drain at endor

vs there is good in him
deploy your sites get gallid and back him up with other characters, there is undercover spys to cancel their force drains, drain them out, if they play on the edges play do they have a code clearance, drain them out
