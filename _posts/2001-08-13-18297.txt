Strategy: '

*** Update *** >

The Barriers and Wookie Kissing, is for when I have to leave a Sentinel Class LAnding Craft at the Asteroid Feild for Resistance. Also for if they drop a DoS on a long Tibanna Gas Minor. Helps Save him so I don’t get whooped on the ground by one character.

Thanks to everyone for your comments they have been a help.

third

*** end of update ***

I’ve always wanted to use Womp Rat’s...

Don’t tell my my destinys are low, because I know they are low... I deal with it. This deck was originally made before Tatooine, and so I’m keeping it as an OT deck for now.

Oh, and don’t tell me that Grimtash works against me, cuase they need force to use it, and since I go first, I get rid of all duplicates (to the table) and Tw’lek for my Well guarded early, for protection...

Basically It’s a DS Dagobah Drain deck...
Asteroid Field takes a Sentinel Class Landing Craft Along with Three Minors down to Dagobah. (I just need one asteroid field around Dagobah, the rest I lose from drains and stuff)

So First Turn I deploy an Asteroid Field And Pull a site to Dagobah. 
Drop The Sentinel Class Landing Craft with however many Tibanna Gas minors I got.
and move them to Dagobah (so no asteroid destiny to screw me up)

Then Second Turn I pull another site to dagobah.
Deploy a Second Craft in the Asteroids, and move it to dagobah.
Land the First Landing Craft, Minors Get out, one moves to each site on the sides.

Third Turn, I drop 2 Cloud Sectors (or three)
Move up one landing craft, down the other, play a third craft and move to Dagobah.

if they try to come to Dagobah, I drop a SFS laser cannon and shoot down their guy in the top clouds with my one Landing Craft, forfet the craft, and deploy another one to move down. This is a risk I have to take. 

I think the rest is pretty self Explanatory.

NOTE like the LS dagobah Deck I have, this is my ’fun deck’ for DS...

I have too many decks to play the same crap all the time, so I have my ’fun decks’, which almost no one ever expects. (plus they aren’t meant to win every game, just be alot of fun to play)

let me know what you think.
