Strategy: '

The main Strategy 
Big, Strong, Dumb.

Alternate Strategy 

This is a deck of Gamorrean. If you didn’t think that can exist, here a good one. But dont overestimate it, if you use it in a tournament, I think that your friends will finish with a higher score than you... )
Search in your deck to take Hutt influence and 
Boelo. Get the Audience chamber (starting location = jabba palace). Get Jabba from reserve deck. I use Jabba because alien deploy -1. When you will have Scum, Jabba and Chall, your gamorrean will deploy for 1 forces. Try to control your site like in any MKOS deck. 
Try to cancel force draining with den of thieves.

If you play against Profit, deploy Chall and Jabba at the Audience chamber.
