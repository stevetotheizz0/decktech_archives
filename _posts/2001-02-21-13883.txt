Strategy: '

I have played this deck and it whips serious buttocks. Now, heres the strat. First turn, go
get Hutt Influence and Audience Chamber using Power of Hutt and Tat JP. If you have
any Twilek Advisors, this is the order you will find your effects S & V, Den of Thieves,
No Bargain, Reactor Teminal. Dont use the ACs game-text until your second or third
turn, so that you dont search for a Jabba and then draw one. You dont want to flip until
you have at least one of the "enforcers", Snoova, Boba Fett, Evazan&Baba in your hand. Ideally,
after three or four turns, your set-up should look like this Tat DH, nobody, Tat JP, one
Enforcer and an Abyssin, JP EC, Bib and Boelo, JP AC, Jabba, Gailid, Mosep,
Myo, JP LP, an enforcer and one Abyssin. Dont deploy Iggy or Dengar until
you are sure you wont need them in space. Keep to your own ground, except in space,
and only deploy Enforcers when they try to battle you in Jabbas Palace. Your drains will
be uncancelable (Hutt Influence) and at the AC, Lower Passages and Entrance Cavern,
you will be draining them for five off the top of their reserve deck and they cannot cancel
it. Ha Ha Every time you initiate battle you retrieve 3 force and they lose one. If they
overpower you, cancel it with a Projective Telepathy or, if you are using an Abyssin to
fight, regenerate him and Ghhhk away the damage. By your sixth turn you will have
canceled quite a few drains with your seemingly endless stock of Abyssins in your Den of
Thieves. Deploy all of them+ one or two enforcers to a sight where the opponent is weak
and the resulting battle damage is astronomical.  What ever yoiu do, deon’t forget to be pulling stuff each turn with Power Of The Hutt Jabba’s Twerps is AWESOME  Retrieves force (like I need more retrievel), it is a 6 destiny (track it for Fett’s gun, YCHF makes Jedi -1 defense value, so you can hit that LS, JK), and how’s this Myo is all by his lonesome at the AC.  Some EPPs drop by kick him in the butt.  You suddenly get out three Abyssins and WHAM  The power reverses in your favor  Boelo is great in this deck.  Let’s say your Obj. is flipped.  You have Bib+Boelo at the EC.  The opponent has Han and Chewie their and plays a Life Debt.  You play that A.O.& Wounded Wookie.  Canceling all but 2 of their battle destiny.  Use Boelo’s text and a Myo to the Obj. and they have no Battle Destiny.  Your draw a +2 destiny that is likely to be a 5 or 6.  You win  I don’t have any Mara’s in the deck because they hurt No Bargain.  I also don’t have room for her and her Stick anyway.  I can’t think of anything else to say, so enjoy
