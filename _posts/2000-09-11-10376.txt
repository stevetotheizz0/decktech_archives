Strategy: '

This deck is lots of fun, and is pretty dangerous too. The basic idea behind it is to get Tessek and Tanus Spijek at the Audience Chamber with Bo Shuda as soon as possible. Then, Eloms deploy for 2, have a forfeit of 4, and a power of 2, 5 against an Imperial. And who plays Imperials? These days, everyone plays Imperials. Your force drains are also plus one wherever you have an Elom. The rest of the deck is fairly self-explanatory. Anyway, this is just a prototype... let me know what you think.'
