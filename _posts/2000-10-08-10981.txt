ADMIRAL’S ORDER (1)
Concentrate All Fire '

Strategy: '



Concentrate on 1 or 2 systems. You should be able to win all battles in space against most decks. Try to wait as long as possible with the flip. Order To Engage is a must.

Because of Hidden Base with retrieval it is possible to win with 1 or no cards in Lost Pile.

Do, Or Do Not is currently the only SA protection, beacuse of the retrieval posibilities.

Strike Planning is there just for the force. If opponent play Endor Operations, don’t start with Strike Planning, but with Aim High or no third Effect.

Your Insight Serves You Well’s main purpose is to get Aim High or Honor Of The Jedi.

Aim High power +5 in battle and helps when playing TIEs.

Intruder Missiles  Try to keep them from table, thus only deploying them in your turn before a battle or as a ’react’ to a battle.

Concentrate All Fire  Ships power +3 and a better change of hitting ships.


A-wing	 stops ’reacts’ (Sword, Shield), can be exchanged for another starship


Cards to include
- second PoaS
- Clouds tegen Ralltiir
- S-Foils, weapon destinies +1, Power +2
- Second Barrier
- It’s A Hit Take a B-wing from Lost Pile
- Second Rapid Fire, great when playing Big Blue
- Effective Repairs, to get ’Altered’ or other lost Effects back.
