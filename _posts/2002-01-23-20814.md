Strategy: '

Not too much strategy.  By now everyone knows how to play everything.  Just need a suggestion or two or a hundred.  That would really be great.  Always wanted to make a deck like this.   I have Jar Jar as my Sidious protection.  Do I need more?  I have Eject Eject in there to take care of that bastard Zuckuss.  I want to put some desparate reach combos in there to take care of barriers.  Please make some suggestions. '
