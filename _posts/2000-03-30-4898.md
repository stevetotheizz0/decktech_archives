Strategy: '

Use your mains to beatdown and use the monks for added drains. S/A is very awesome and can win games by cancelling key cards. Small space fleet should be enough to fulfill Battle Plan. Use Eject Eject on bounty hunter ships since you cant claw them. Use Ultimatum against odds. Do Smoke Screens with Ben for battle destinies of 6. Start Battle Plan against Operatives and TIE's. Use Rebel Barrier and It's a Trap to pick your fights. All of my character can draw battle destiny alone except for Chewie and Han so out attritioning them is easy when combined with Smoke Screen. Use Careful Planning for Jabba's Palace against the occassional Jabba's Palace deck. Gimer Stick/OTE/Sorry About the Mess has won me several gams by taking out key characters. '
