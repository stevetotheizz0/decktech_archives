Strategy: '

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
A few quick points to make.
1. Uncontollable is not worthless.  If you don't play Lord Vader you get hit.	And chances are only 2 out of every 3 Vader's in a deck will be Lord Vaders.
2. Electrobinuculars are no longer viable thanks to Sim Aloo.  They may still work for the early tests but they are worthless on test 5 if Sim is out.
3. With this deck I have beat Rops, TIEs, Brangus Glee Superstar, BHBM, Tatooine Occupation, and basically any other deck type you can think of.  The only major archetype that I haven't played against is Hunt Down.
4. Cards you think will hurt me but don't; and cards you think I should play but I don't.
     a.  Ability x3->I've played against it several times, every time it has either been canceled or the damage has been avoided.
     b.  Anger, Fear, Agression->It's only good when played in multiples and I don't have the room.
     c.  SAC->Why should I put in relatively low destiny cards that are basically worthless until I flip.
     d.  DOS->I play the odds.	Odds are that she won't be in your oppening hand.

Just to reiterate.  This deck is great.  If you can't win with it it si because greatness is something that you haven't achieved.  This deck has only lost once(it was somewhat of a fluke).	It later beat this deck by 31 force. And if you do gove me a bad review at least give me some solid reasons.  Faramir gave me a bad review but it was at least backed up with some decent explanation.

A card with a 7 next to it denotes a card with destiny of 7.  Complicated, isn't it.

This will be a fairly quick strategy.  Nothing more than a few hints.

- Against BHBM wait until Vader is at a Battleground site and then deploy Jedi Luke directy to him.
- Use the Cantina with a couple of characters to stop the damage of Search And Destroy
- Make sure you know if your opponent has Secret Plans and/or CHYBC deployed when you are close to finshing T5 so you can retrieve 10
- Deploy DOS from reserve first if possible, Yoda second
- If you draw DOS in your hand try to put her back with Yoda Stew, if you can't decide whether or not to test her without the objective or to deploy and test EPP Luke
- Try to kill Sim Aloo, he makes testing a pain, especially when combined with Broken Concentration
- Don't worry yourself too much with getting a 7 on test 5
- Try to hurry against Rops, they don't cause a lot f damage and you can't drain for much at their sites so these games can time out quite often
- Completeing test 6 is not neccesary, do it only if the apprentice is guarenteed to stay alive after putting her where the opponent can get her.  Instead of completing just make them deploy Vader so you can kill him ad they can lose 2 from the test.
- Be careful against space deck (especially TIEs), always try to deploy your ships in pairs to lessen the pain caused by Lateral Damage
- If you have any question Dmail me before you review.  If you think that I have made a mistake on a ruling or something to that effect than realize this now, you are wrong.  Everything here is error free. '
