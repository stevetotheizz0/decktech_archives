__________________________________________________

Why Yavin 4 DB and Hoth DB , (they are Rebel Base Location) , because with Imperial Decree you can Cancal opponets Force Drain Bonuses and can Cancel Revolution

Why Sim aloo and Janus Greetjatus , when they are
deployed to the Emporer they are Really Cheap , and they make you win duels (janus for your own Destinys and Sim to Manupulate opponents Destiny)

Why Control , because Sense and Alter Destiny draws are +4 And it can cancel forcedrains

__________________________________________________

VS Hidden BAse 
Get your all your ships to one System and drain there (make beatdowns with zuckus and the other
BH ships for multiple destinys)
Visage will hurt them , if they play mains track your destinys and duel luke , obi .

VS EBO
start with Imperial Decree , get control of Hoth DB and Yavin 4 DB (but be careful of speeder Beatdowns) so Ebo dosent hurt you
