This deck allows for major force loss by draining and
battling.start with jedi pack han frozen he always stays alive along with tessk and tanis. throw down bo shuda first turn and if there are aliens put down order to engage. search for tanis, tessek and harc with you will take me to jabba now.search for the dockings bays and keep afallen portal ready(there are enough 4’s to kill anything).don’t put rebels to jabbas palce sites. put lando at tatooinre jabbas palace and bomar monk (or tawes khaa and bomarr). and just spread out.use rebels barriers and narrow esape when neccesary.


ratliirr-thanks god .eloms what to fight the imperials and they kill the @#$%es

hunt down - this is a tough matchup but honor should last until he brings vader out than be careful. i took the anti dueling cards out if you want put them back in

court- although eloms are useless against this deck there are enough mains to win ( watch when they drop mara bring eloms and kick her @#$% and then rape her.

ties and other major drain decks- set up faster and hope you win the race battle if neccesary.

bhbm- this is a tough deck, give vader luke and then bring a beatdoen force and kick his ass.mabey put captive fury in.
