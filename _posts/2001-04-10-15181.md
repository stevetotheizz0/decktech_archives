Then Send YCHF to pull our Perimeter Patrol Deploy and draw a if you have to darw 1 or 2. Setup in space quick and if they come to fight beat them down with all you ve got. Use your multiple destny s from Thrawn, Bossk, and Imperial command. Drain if they don t come to you and if they play dumb you can beat them down on the ground.


The Cards Lateral Damage the Super Falcon and slow their activation and drains with Battle Order. Cancel their force drain bonuses with decree. Retrieve with First Strike.
