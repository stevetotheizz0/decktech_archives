Strategy: '

Well, you basically play this deck like any other RalOps.	Get out your sites, put down some fodder and walkers, and flip.  Once that happens, drain and battle your opponent to death.
The only things that are too different about this deck is the addition of two senses, two ghhhks, and extra effects.  The things that are missing
Igar/Tempest 1 (I don't own)
Mara/Mara's Stick (Ditto)
so, once you flip you get your battling forces together and go fight.  Your additons to battle destiny will help the already high destinies in this deck.  Go and have fun with your opponent.
well, now for some card choice explanations
Characters, pretty basic, not too many though
Vehicles, I chose these for power and reacting ability
Starships, all the BHunter's ships, plus Devastator for support
Locations, a lot of systems, to convert (to lower space drains) and activation
Effects, protection for odd decks, and for popular ones as well, plus stuff like Lateral Damage
Interrupts, mostly basic stuff, except the SAC and Ghhhks, but they're used a lot

now, vs specific deck types

HB, you must prevent control of Ralltiir, once you flip and deploy Security Precautions, Battle and Probe

Profit, whether they come to you or not, protect your sites and drain in space some as well, you should win the drain race

MWYHL, not any Training prevention cards in here, but try to battle en masse when possible

QMC, try to prevent their flip by controling the skys, battle and drain

Throne Room/Tosche Mains, the reason for the Ghhhks, and the Main Course, try to flip, that is the key to victory

that's all I can think of right now

All constructive criticism is welcome,
Talz
