Object of deck
The goal is fast direct damage with this deck.	Set up Dark Deal and Occupation fast.  Flip.  Get out We’re In Attack Position Now.  You will be hitting your opponent hard and big.  Use Imperial Command to pull forces and add destinies where possible.  React across Cloud City with your AT-STs for defense.
Thanks to Imperial Command, your Admirals should help with holding Bespin and going on offense if the opportunity arises.  Your Generals can work the same magic on the ground.

Explanations on certain cards
Imperial Command x5 - this insures that you’ll have good characters in your hand when need be.  Running five may be seen as excessive, but if you’re using them heavily, it’s always good to find another one upon drawing.
Admiral Motti - the Admiral seeing the least amount of normal play.  He’s an ability 3 pilot, which allows him to hold a site when piloting a walker.
Emperor and Vader Shuttles - low deploy, high forfeit, Vader’s moves for free, can help set up Dark Deal, among other things.
starting Upper Walkway - Drain -1 for your opponent.  This helps if you can’t get set up before your opponent invades CC.	You could start Casino in play of this to fake your opponent into thinking you’re running Sabacc if you wish.
