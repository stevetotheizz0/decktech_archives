Strategy: '

*New*

How Bout If I try podracing with sebulba’s pod instead of trace?


tell me in your response


I think this deck has a lot of potential, so please give your best and honest opinions. Please don’t forget to elaborate.


Now for the strategy...

 I chose my 3 starters for simple, yet important reasons. All Wrapped Up captures characters, His Name Is Anakin protects against staging areas and makes it harder for aliens to deploy, and I Will Find Them Quickly, Master is to capture Amidala.


 My choice of characters was based on game text as well as power. I put most of the best bounty hunters in so capturing is fast. 


 Now for the effects. He Is Not Ready annoys the opponent by making him move. I use this when I have high power on either side. It can also be used for making jedi training harder. I just put one bounty in here since it is a used effect. Lateral Damage could be used on a really powerful capital ship, like Home One. My personal favorite out of my effects is Luke? Luuuuke. Deploy it on the Rancor Pit, since it is now a tatooine site,  and Luke is power 3 at best until he gets eaten by the rancor


I have a wide range of interrupts here. Why Didnt You Tell Me and Main Course are power and attrition decreasers. I Have You Now and Jabbas Through With You are battle destiny adders. Double Back and Hidden Weapons are for my bounty hunters. Physical Choke can be used by both of my Dark Jedi.


Thats about it, all my other cards are self explanatory. Give me some good opinions to make this deck better. Thanks a bunch
