UPDATE  Sorry about the italics tags. I was trying to be cute, and didn’t know if they would work or not.  I won’t bother next time. =)  The durned apostrophes are from copying/pasting from Word.  Curses.  Ah, well.  Enjoy anyway.

This is a very solid style of deck that has proven itself in countless tournament victories over the course of three years by combining a high number of cards with ability (33) with a few key effects and some choice interrupts.  

Back in the day, this deck used Probe Droids and Undercovers -- it could still be made to do so again, but I prefer this version.  It is basically a take-it to  your opponent style of play on the ground, with only a couple of sites to really use your walkers at.  If they are playing solid space, all of your Star Destroyers have vehicle capacity -- use them as forfeit fodder.  The systems included are chosen for drain (Sullust, Kashyyyk, Endor) or movement (Yavin 4) purposes.  

The best resource in this deck are the 2/2 Imperial scrubs who’s forfeit is boosted by Arrest Order.  Usually any one of them paired with any other ”blue” card will net you a destiny draw somewhere, be it in a walker on the ground or a starship in space.  The non-ability 2 characters are included solely for game text purposes (Thrawn, Pellaeon, Piett, etc.).   Everyone is a pilot, and only 2 characters are dedicated ground (Veers, Igar) but even they can be used for destiny draws in space despite their inability to add power to starships.   Scramble does not frighten me at all -- none of these guys will ever be anywhere on the ground that’s not enclosed by metal (i.e. inside a walker).

The interrupt and effect choices are the key. Imperial Arrest Order was a godsend for this deck, as was Mobilization Points (I can grab the Executor into hand?  Rock).  Something Special Planned For Them is also tailor made, as one of the big problems this deck has is combating retrieval (thus the Secret Plans as well).  Resistance is a no-brainer -- my blanket numbers/EBO or other high drain protection.  First Strike is probably the weakest choice, but I like the ability to cost my opponent something extra for allowing me to battle him, as well as the slight bit of retrieval it offers me.  

On the interrupt side, Prepared Defenses is obvious.   I will typically start IAO/Mob Points with one other.  Often it is Something Special, but feel free to mix and match depending upon what you think you’re playing (Secret Plans would be good to start against Profit, most likely).  Ghhhk & Those Rebels Won’t Escape Us made the deck more card efficient as each of those used to be in here separately.  Projective Telepathy is something of an anti-beatdown card (you should have saved a couple more Force to battle me, eh?) but I also am seeing Anger, Fear, Aggression pop up periodically.  Tarkin’s Orders is mainly in here for the used text, but the lost text will still cancel some nicer LS interrupts that often see play.  Endor Occupation is anti-Celebration of all kinds, as well as some extra activation if needed.  Imperial Command is obvious, as is the Twi’lek.   Imperial Supply is perhaps the only card I’m toying with changing out -- replacing it with a Blast Door Controls (damn Rebel Barriers).

I used to play with only We’re In Attack Position, but the rise of WYS decks compelled me to add Battle Deployment.  It not only cuts down on their draws on the ground, but cuts into their power in space unless they’re playing with Medium Bulk Freighters (which some variants do).  Use  Piett to grab either depending on the situation you’re in.  

This is a very solid deck that can stand up to just about everything you can throw at it.  It’s beaten Profit, WYS, TIGIH, Revo/Nudj (back when that was popular) and handles traditional Hidden Base without hardly flinching.   No, it is not designed to handle EVERY contingency, but if I did that, I wouldn’t have room for any characters after all the effects and interrupts I needed.  

Constructive criticism is always welcome.  Don’t knock it too hard ’til you’ve tried it.  I admit that this style of play is not for everyone -- I typically avoid interrupts and effects, while it seems that most people prefer hordes of red.  Still, give it a shot, and you’ll realize that you don’t necessarily need all that red to get the job done.
