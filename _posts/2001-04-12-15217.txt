Another deck by Cat...

When this Objective came out I was quite pleased but then read that I couldnt use some of the characters that I wanted and then put it in the box and left it there...Then one day I came here and read that someone had one with the starting of Twilek and Presence Of The Force to get a first turn drain and flip. So I made a deck similiar to that, but the deck that I had was to overcommitted to keeping guys at Courscant so I remade it this way.

Essentially you get Xizor off Courscant w/Guris assistance to Tatooine. Of which you have 4 Jabba Palaces to get out your AC so that you can get S&V going. This is key, and even tho it can be altered most people forget that. The beauty of the deck is Tatooine, yes there are three of them, and why you might ask, well I want it out so that I can put the Sunsdown  there. Cause then not only my Makurths tough, but their Immune To Attrition <4 which makes them BEEFY! Plus the can scream for 1 when I battle and I can get some more force back w/ S&V

Keep Xizor alive, with his friend, Guri and a Makurth and spread w/the Hunters and others. Keeping the planet believe it or not is quite simple, you just put everything there that you have and hold it that way. No ones stupid enough to come to you with, ZiMH, BiHT and BFiS1 and worst of all you can drop the Stinger and Virago at the DB and move Xizor and Guri over and up and thats just plain wrong.

Remember to get those Docking Bays out quick so that you can get your pleebs on Tatooine, oh, and I know there is nothing for Mobilization Points to get, its there for the activation cause you want some of that so that you can make use of the Makurths...and I know I could add some more DBs and people there to hold them that way, but I found that spreading that thing over different areas just weakens the deck and makes it loose. This way I can focus just on Tatooine and (some of Courscant) and battle there.

Against most decks its a fighting style, if they come to fight you, you usually have the upper hand advantage in a straight Brawl, however once the weapons start coming up, watch your characters carefully so that you dont loose them to quickly, just remember you can get them back when you battle them.


Thanks again for reading another wonderfully fun filled deck by the Garindan Collector
