Strategy: 

Tactic:
-I use ,,Crush the Rebellion’’ to get Evader/ Monnok out of the 
 Reserve Deck and then I play Monnok to make all but 8 into the 
 use Pile.
-With I’m Sorry i take two Cloud City interritor sites into hand 
 before i activat force
-with talon roll and the ties i can easy hold the sky.
-with the trooper and the trooper assaults can i battle my opponent 
 with characters, wich are very cheap and with the interrupt power 3
 or 4. 
-with characters, like lobot, lando can you flip your objectiv very
 fast.
-with set for stun you can make inportant characters into the hand.
