Card Explanations:
2 moisture farms?
  Force drain +1, and +1 weapon destiny, plus Destroyed Homestead makes them needed!

Why Vader w/saber?
Highly disposable suicide hitter or park with Tarkin, homestead, and death mark at the farm.

Emperor?
 Works with Mara. 6 destiny, lets you peek at destiny left in deck.

Why Jabba, not beefier versions?
 Cheaper, makes an alien cheaper, not worried otherwise.

Why Murttoc Yine?
 First off, he is a spy.  Secondly, he can get Mara, Ephant, Dr. E, and 4-Lom with his text.

Death mark?
 Target Han, put him in dungeon, 1 force a turn!

Destroyed Homestead?
 Ditto above, save for Luke and Obi.

No Escape
 HOTJ hurts bad!

Why POTF?
 Instant beats, without a spy.
