Strategy: '

This deck has got what it takes to piss your opponent off . Basically its a moderate retrieval , force drain canceller , huge drain and beatdown deck . Read the strategy before reviewing ........


Here we go.........


You start out with the chamber and hutt trade route . Try to steadily deploy characters until you flip . You should have little problem if your opponent is not playing Tattoine . If he is , pull Bo Shuda out and stack non Rebel chars there . Stack Rebels in Hutt Tarade Route or Cantina(if it is out) . When you feel safe to flip , move your chars out of the chamber , leaving only Tessek and Tanus there . If Figurin is out , leave him there too .



When you flip.......


Block drains with Bargaining Table . Retrieve whenever possible . Use Luke either in space or ground . Wedge and Luke does a lot of damage with Wedge’s gametext . Try to stall opponent from doing whatever he is trying to do . Take it easy on Tattoine because


(1)He won’t blow Tattoine up .

(2)Eloms can battle very well . In Cantina , and  an Imperial present , each of them are power 6 .

(3)At most desperate times , you can always run into Audience Chamber , provided Bubo isn’t there to bite the crap put of you .


However.......


Try not to move Rebels to JP sites because it may allow opponent to cancel Bo Shuda . Never leave only one char in Audience Chamber unless you have Bo Shuda . Always have 2 aliens in each site for the objective benefits .


And now for the matchups..........



BHBM.........


The easiest matchup . You can take Luke out and put far from Vader . Or you can use the EPP Luke over and over again to kill his chars . I myself prefer to give him my EPP Luke at the start so that he loses force . I don’t think he will lose duels . His Imperials will get kicked in the but+ .



HD..........


Keep Luke away from Vader at all cause . The same goes for Obi . You can afford the Visage and you should be able outdrain him .



Alien based decks......


If its Court , take out HOT Jedi and Bo Shuda . He will be losing force if he does not occupy a battlegound(the chamber isn’t after Bo Shuda is out)Slowly stack chars and hold him out using projections . When you are ready , flip . Then thats the end of his sex life . By the way your Eloms are only power 2 even with Tanus . I won a guy by 29 force and no lost pile . His was Court Of The Vile Jabba .




If its MKOS , you are almost screwed . Play it as you would with court and you just might win . (almost unlikely though)



Cards I might want to put in....


EPP Obi

more Eloms

another Tessek

another Bo Shuda




*thats all folks . Tell me if there are cards I should put in this deck . However , its most probally I don’t have those cards .
