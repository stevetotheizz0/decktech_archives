Strategy: '

Ok, I knew a lot of you guys don’t like Court Of ...., but it’s a amazing deck. Just mixed up with

Podracin’, no dark player will lose a podrace with 3 Podracer Collision’s and 3 We Must Accelerate Our Plans.

Cause if you lose with these cards a race, you are not a PODRACER.


Let’s start to tell you, how I play this deck. The starting hand is very important for this deck, for example

if I pick up 1 Barrier and/or 1 None Shall Pass,I pull out Gailid in the first round Then I will drain my 

opponent for 2 every turn, and nobody (execpt Training deck’s) will stop this drain fast. Of course if I don’t have

no blocking cards in hand like None Shall Pass or Barrier, I play the typical Court style, I pull out some aliens like 

Boelo, Jabba and Ephant Mon, to protect my chamber. But 80% of my games I pull out Gailid. So now I try to deploy my effects

like Drop, this card rocks And then I go out with my b. hunters and "Jabba’s Through With You" to battle a little bit.

With Scum I also retrieve 2 Force, per battle, so I will never had a big lost pile After some turns I will win the race, 

and now the game is almost over, cause it’s hard for every deck to lose 11 or 6 force,and I will retrieve 11 or 6 

force this is just a difference of 12 or 22 


Thx to all who read/rated my deck
