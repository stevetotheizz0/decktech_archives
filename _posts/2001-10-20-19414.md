Strategy: '

This deck is simple, stop force drains with your objective and rebel fleet. If you put haven on your hidden base, the other side will not be able to probe you. Your x-wings will deploy for free there the Docking and repair effect will be like a bacta tank for ships.The civil disorder is a must in this deck, because you have so many starships, continue to deploy them and it will make them deploy a card with ability or lose 2, which eventually will kill them. I usually wait to deploy too many starships before i flip so i can get cards in my hand(because the interrupts are very useful in this deck.) Since all the starfighters have over 3 manuever, you basically can add one battle destiny every battle and not to mention that you can add a battle destiny at the spot of haven. Because i have seen many decks that continueally use one kind off interrput to retrieve, i put what are you tryin to push on us to grab them. The ”vergeance in the force” will be a backup just in case you cant block there force drains, you wil limit them to 1. I put Luke in there for safety precation(hunt down.) I hope you like my deck design and take in into account when making your own hidden base deck  '
