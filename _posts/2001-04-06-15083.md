Strategy: '

I heard someone call "Profit" weak... I think they are nuts. This deck has serious killing potential on land and in space. I agree you do have to play it conservatively, but this deck does win quite a bit.


Techs/Combos


Gift-Threepio-Artoo... if you don’t understand this don’t play this deck


Gen Cal-Nien Numb-GS1-Leg SF-Punch It... Strong space and protection from tie cannons and Cal can be pulled with Strike Planning if need be. Save Punch It for a foolish opponent’s assault. Legendary Starfighter ups the ante even more


Liberty-Haash’n-Home One-Ackbar... More strong space and tie cannon protection. Ackbar can pull either haash’n or Capital Support. Haash’n stops Lateral Damage while you guard Tatooine Celebration


Wedge-RS1-Dash-Outrider... okay backup on land and absolutely cool in space


Crix... More capital Support Damage and if you get Chewie’s Bow and no Protector in hand you can pull Chew of K for a bit higher deploy


Capital Support... deploy character as pilot to capital ship shuttle them down to surface for cheaper deploys... Liberty get immunity to attrition and Home One become dang near permanent... You have Gen Cal, Crix, Solo, and Obi Wan for direct damage


Corran Horn-Tawss Khaa... Mara, Jabba, and bounty hunter fighters. nice backup for your mains


Advantage... If they lose vader or the emperor this hurts alot


Chasm... Dark side uses alot of doubles these days and I don’t... them getting zeroes and losing force is nice


Chewie’s Bowcaster... It’s basicaly Chewie’s lightsaber sans force drains adder


Destiny Adders... duh they add destinies and have can be useful for what they can pull as well


Mains and Toys Fighting and Direct Damage from the objective use Weapon Lev used to pull the toys, it’s also great for canceling a well timed you are beaten.


Tatooine Celebration and Reflection... My only source of retrival and neither can be grabbed. Reflection is for late game retrival against tough match-ups


Note


Don’t get greedy after you flip keep your mains spreed on no more than three tatooine sites and be sure to back them up with others. 


Late game you may want to switch personas to Generals if your AO’s out. 


Keep six ability at every site for Xizor protection 


Remember that if they drop DLOTS to chewie’s site he is gone so back him up


Place your mains in accordance to what destiny adder or adders you have in hand


Imperial decree and Battle Order don’t affect you that much once you have flipped so don’t go off to kill a superior space force. Get to Tatooine and get Celebration up and running.


Match-ups 


Doesn’t matter make them come to you on Tatooine unless you see an easy beatdown, but be careful of baited traps.


Possible changes


Finding room for Run, Luke, Run would be nice
