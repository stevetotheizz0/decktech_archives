Strategy: 

This deck is all around good.  Use the EPPs to combat on the ground, but save EPP Han if you think General Solo would be better on the Falcon.

Vs. Ops start Battle Plan and use the EPPs to disrupt 'em. Outdraining them shouldn't be too hard.  TPTIFF will also help quite a bit.

Vs. Hunt Down stay in space and annihilate their puny resistance with a swarm.	It can easily take out a deck in one swarm.

Vs. Manipulation Battle them and drain as much as possible in space!  It probably should have more protection, but I've beaten most manip decks with this deck.  Use Antilles for a CCT deck.
