Strategy: 

!!!!!!Read Before Rating!!!!!!!!
The way you want to start this deck out is with The Signal and Yarna d’al Gargan then your first turn take out endor deploy some X-wings to Rendezvous Point for free and move them over to Endor for free.
Now each turn take out a system and try to get out Rebel Fleet to stop at least one force drain for sure.
After that get TK-422 and Boushh out so you will be stopping 3 drains and eventually flip the objective and then you will be stopping 5 force drains!
Now if they have a space deck that is great you will just over power them with S-Foils, and Organized Attack, and sometimes Out Of Nowhere.
If they have a major ground deck just stop there drains all the while your draining them. Now if they are Bounty Hunter ship happy that is no problem, easily shoot them down with the laser cannons and preferibly using the 3 force so they will be immediatly lost.
And also when in battle you will also be able to become even more powerful with Concentrate All Fire.
If for some reason close to the end of the game you have some cards in your lost pile, easily retrieve them with All Wings Report In, that will atleast give you 10 force back.
One more advantage is that with all these systems you lose no more than 2 force from each except for Tatooine and Sullest.
!!!!!!!!!This accedentally has 64 cards so when you play take out so take out 1 X-wing and 2 laser cannons and Endor!!!!!!!!!
