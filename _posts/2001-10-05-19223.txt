Strategy :

Well it’s just a idea, just a fun deck, but i played this deck often, and I´ve often won 
also against ruf light site decks, but it’s not a tournament deck. It has the same strategy as a 
basic Court deck, just with Podracin’. Try to keep the chamber clean, and give rockin’ drains with
"sweety" Gailid. The ruf Bounty Hunters will keep you alive.

Thx to all who rate my deck, and if you have some awesome new ideas, tell me.
