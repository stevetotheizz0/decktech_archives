Update

Sorry if I have to say this but some members of this site are real mofos. comando for example give my deck 2.5* because my title is ”lame”. Good reason??? Probably not. So the same guy gave Brian Hunter’s deck 5*s although he thought that his deck is gay just because BH is BH. So one might ask who’s lame here

In these days it seems like everyone plays Senate or Lightsaber Combat so I thought about playing good old EBO with some of the new good cards.

Early Game 

First round you activate and then get your Docking Bay with Insurrection. Afterwards you should use your Nashada Wind Chimes and/or Signal to get your little aliens and/or A New Secret Base. If you get it then deploy first the sites with 2 of the aliens at Corridor and War Room and 1 pilot with ship at the Docking Bay. Now you can deploy EBO and to Hoth. Next turns set up ships at your 2 systems and start draining like a mad man. If opponent has certain key interrupts like Imperial Command or something like that use your shields to catch it. Also deploy Luke with or without his stick to the 4th marker to satisfy Battle Plan.

Mid Game

Follow your game plan to cause your opponent some damage. Also use your enhanced characters to do some hit and run battles on the ground and disturb your opponents game plan. Theres also A Jedis Resilience in this deck to get your guys back and strike again. This combined with Bacta Tank should be enough to keep your Jedis in the game. Your Baragwins will help you get some retrival going and get stuff like Lukes stick or X-Wing cannon back.
If your opponent wants to get you on the ground then use Barrier and Snow Storm to fight your opponent. Sadly you cant use OTE because it was f*cked up by Decipher -(

Late Game

Try to get an advantage through your drains and suicide runs so you can concentrate on retrieving and tracking in the late game with Baragwins. By now your Deck should be quiet small so you can do some easy tracking and use some 7s to kill your opponents and retreive with On The Edge.

Destiny Layout

0s - 5 (all pullable with ANB)
1s - 5
2s - 8
3s - 9
4s - 3
5s - 11
6s - 6
7s - 5

Card Choices

Baragwin&Ishi Tib - Tracking/Retrival/Set Up EBO

KalFalnl Cndros - use her to get a destiny on Spiral; set up EBO and just do some Battling together with Obi or Quiggy and afterwards you can just throw her on your Bacta Tank and deploy her next turn for free.

Intruder Missile/Bionic Arm - Trackable destinies with the help of you Baragwins. You can also deploy an Intruder Missile on your Falcon and shoot down Chimaera, Bossk or whatever with a tracked 7 -)
The Bionic Arm is also nice if your opponent plays with Disarmed. The point is you can decide what is more important in your area. If you fear heavy space than just use 4 Intruder Missiles and no BAs and if there are lots of Disarmeds floating around in your area than use only BAs -)

Rebel Barrier;Hyper Escape;H/OON - hm I guess I wrote Imperial Barrier above, I always do that.whatever. those cards are mainly in there for evasion and to save your @$$

For myself I think that giving advice against certain decktypes is useless because the decks differ in every area and if you go to a bigger tourny you should know how to use your cards. In fact you should just follow your game plan and react to what the opponent does

Hope you liked it and that Ill get some useful reviews.
