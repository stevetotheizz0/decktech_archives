Strategy: '

Notice that there is no Sense and Alter Protection, you don’t need it once you flip they can not be played.  And it is so easy to flip.  Don’t deploy Leia for 10, it’s not worth it.  Use I Know to get her out free(remember free is  unmodifiable).  Try to get Mos Eisley out ASAP,  since you can look for Kessel and Corellia  you can see if it is in your force pile.  Get the Super Falcon at Kessel and get a good 3 or 4 Smugglers at the Cantina and shuffle to Mos Eisley for a good drain.  Savrip is Key in this deck also...Smugglers are forfit +2 once you flip.

Against Huntdown.
I would suggest not deploying Luke.  Visage won’t hurt much.  With 2 trans terminated and you can play them out of the lost pile.

Agaisnt BHBM.
Probably the hardest to beat because Luke is real helpfull on the ground.  Give Vader Rebel Scout Luke and send him to the Throne Room and hope you win the duels.

Against Scum Decks.
Stay in Space... Drain at all 3 systems and exploit your On The Edges.

This Deck went undefeated in Playtesting.  Tim Guzman and I played it at a Local tournament it also went undefeated there.  A lot of people said that this objective sucks but they are wrong... It’s Broken.

Props
To Tim Guzman for helping build it.
To Dan Christy for letting me borrow some cards...They helped, Thanks.

Slops
The Raiders for playing a sloppy game against the Ravens.
