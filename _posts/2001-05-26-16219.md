Strategy: '

Before I go on into the strategy section of this submission, I am going to elaborate upon what I said in the summary. After a while (after WHFANSBv.2.75 was posted and reviewed) I took my beloved EBO deck apart. Because of my schedule I had not been able to play much SWCCG, until now. AugustaCon is coming up and I haven’t play in a tournament since either January or December so I needed decks that I felt comfortable with. For Light Side I chose EBO X-wing Swarm and Dark Side I will probably use D*2 TIEs but I am not certain yet. Anyway. I reconstructed the EBO deck to my liking and here it is. The deck isn’t much changed since v.2.75 (i think), but I thought you might want to look at it and help me for the tournament. For those of you who don’t know AugustaCon’s SWCCG tournaments are at 100 on Saturday and 1200 Sunday. They 1200 is free and everyone gets a prize. The 100, however, is not and costs $5 because the prize is only to first place and it is either a Tatooine box or a Reflections 2 box. Either one, I want it (even though I probably wont get it but a guy can hope). I am going to both for practice only.


STRATEGY

Start with Hoth MPG and Hoth North Ridge with The Signal grabbing ANSB. Then do the standard EBO stuff and play really smart and win with battles and drains. I chose the planet the ways I did because they can all be grabbed with ANSB and have great abilities. 2 have changed for the better. This deck has really high destinies and that usually surprises people. If you want a detailed strategy section then check out WHFANSBv.2.75 and review it while you are there and then come back and review this one.


ANSWERS TO REVIEWS

Thanx guys.

I posted this deck before the tournament because I like always play this deck but because I am a scrub they never tech against because nobody else plays EBO X-wing Swarm in my area.

I don’t have another Incom Corp. but I wouldn’t add another because I have 3 Signals to get it so it would be wasted and there are alot of other effects to get like Yarna and Rebel Fleet.

(I’m sorry if I don’t put your name down, I’m to lazy and its 730 on a weekend YAWN)

POLL

When you review this deck plz also include whether or not I should drop HOTJ and if so, what for.
