Strategy: '

NOTE The name of this deck is not derived from the card ’Monnok,’ instead from the lore of Myo (since he*s my rep) -)


***EDIT*** 
Pull Bossk with Gun, Stinger, and some other jank cards for No Escape, Dengar in Ship, another Myo, and Death Mark (nice against WYS).

***End Edit*** 

First of all, let*s go over some cards


Omni Box & It*s Worse

It Could Be Worse is huge in my area, so if your deck doesn*t run at least 1 It*s Worse, then your screwed.  Even if your opp isn*t playing ICBW, you still have a handy reusable 5 card that kills tracking.


Jabba*s Twerps

This is an awesome card.  Destiny 6, and I can retrieve up to 5 force with it.  If I*m not in the mood to retrieve, just wait until there*s a battle and use the less helpful text to get some Abyssins.


3 Masterful Moves??

While this may seem like a lot, I just love to pull a Ghhhk, battle, retrieve 3 and the opp loses 1, kill off a few characters with the +2 BD bonus, then Ghhk.


Why start with Secret Plans?

With the abundance of WYS decks running around, I prefer to start with Secret Plans to delay those pesky Harvests.


Expand The Empire

This is a lovely card, especially if you get in in the beginning of the game.  Get it on the AC to pull 2 more aliens, 1 to the Lower Passages and 1 to Tat JP.  This is huge if you get it early, then pull Jabba, Gailid, and Mosep for one heck of a fast drain set up and the +2 BD bonus.

Matchups


vs. WYS

If they*re using Raiders, only initiate battles where you have Guri, or where you can handle multiple destinies.  If you really need some retrieval, just initiate, retrieve, and Ghhhk.

If they*re playing a lot of Raiders, Masterful Move for a Monnok and try to play it at a good time.

With the 4 ships in this deck and the BD bonus, you should be able to wear down their stronghold at the Tat. system to rid them of Tat. Celebration.

I have yet to play a strong WYS deck with this deck, as it*s fairly new, so I I*m not sure how hard of a match it will be.


vs. TRM (Cheese)

Just set up as usual, drain like heII, and always hold on to a spare Ghhhk.  If played right, this should be an easy match-up.


vs. Hidden Base or EBOX

Get your drains and Search And Destroy out early for some good direct damage.  Get Hutt Unfluence out ASAP as well, so they can*t cancel your drains with SWSTYF.  The ships will become useful in suicide battles for retrieving.  The Control Combo becomes vital against EBOX to cancel those giant drains at Kessel.  Once you have played both Controls, play Jabba*s Twerps to get at least 1 back, track it, and cancel again next turn.  This deck usually performs best against heavy blue decks, so there shouldn*t be many problems.


vs. Profit

If Profit is big in your area, take out something for a CC Engineer.  Start with the CCE and Mara at the AC, convert the AC and pull Mara’s Saber.  A tracked 5 or 6 can Set For Stun Boushh, and I have done this easily many times (and believe me, I*m no good at tracking).


If you have any questions, d-mail me BEFORE you rate the deck, just in case you misunderstood something.
