RESPONSE TO REVIEWS
This deck has HUGE activation. I activate 14-18 force every REGULAR TURN. It's b/c of the docking bays and mobilazation Points. Plus you have TR & Rendili out as well as Emperor. Try the deck if you don't believe me. Thanks

************* THAT 1 KID is so DUMB. Total space doesn't KILL me..90% of the time I WIN I can't believe he game me 3 STARS 
    Hey, if one of you who are REVIEWING MY DECK RIGHT NOW could give me an extra star (added on to the review you would normally give me) to combat that kid's STUPID review I'd be grateful. THANKS **************

Honer of the Jedi isn't a big deal against MWYHL. If I can alter it I will but if not then I still win (My deck is like 4-0)
<<<<<<<<<<

Again remember that I made this deck the day that Death Star 2 CAME OUT so please DON*T give me bad reviews because you think I copied the deck. Now most of you should know the basic strategy behind this deck since this type of deck is popular. But for those of you who don’t know I*ll explain. This deck is played much like Throne Room mains with the difference being that this Dark deck activates a HOARD more and takes out mains way easier. What you do is get out docking bays (pull D*2 docking bay first) with Imperial Arrest Order, and deploy guys to them to activate HOARDS of force with Mobilization Points. Then you let Emperor sit back with Emperor’s Power at his Throne Room and them beat on your opponent wherever they are.
  This deck can just KICK BUTT since it can slaughter ANY mains deck by using Darth combined with the Objective and The Circle Is Now Complete. By using these two cards the light side is without Luke or Obi-Wan leaving just Han and Leia. With Emperor*s Power on the table along with Sense (get rid of adders) and your BEAT down squads you just ROCK to victory. This deck is now 10-1 with a differential of +210 (WOW) so, as you can see, it ROCKS.
  Here’s some quick card explanations so you know what they do

ADMIRAL CHIRANEAU He is a nice guy that you can use with Arrest Order as well as using him as a scrub (at a DB) or on a Star estroyer (adds 1 to your drain)
SEARCH AND DESTROY This is to combat Hidden Base as well as EBO.
COME HERE YOU BIG COWARD This is to stop Jedi Testing from retrieving if they don*t occupy 2 Battle Grounds (which, without Luke or Obi, will be VERY HARD) as well as hurting EBO*s drains on the ground.
CIRCLE IS NOW COMPLETE/WEAPON LEVATATION The Circle is to get rid of Obi (DUH) and the weapon levo helps Darth grab old Ben*s stick (which, if your dueling Ben K, makes all the difference)
RISE MY FRIEND I just LOVE this card. I use mostly to pick up Darth for LOTS of beatdowns but it can also be used to get Darth to Emperor to turn Luke.

As you can see there are MANY other NASTY combos in this deck and with Emperor*s power your forces are almost unbeatable.

AGAINST HIDDEN BASE Get set up with Vader and your docking bays and then pull either Search & Destroy or Security Precautions with You Cannot Hide Forever. If they do not flip then they are SO DEAD since your drains combined with Your Destiny, and starship beats will wreak them. If they do flip get out SP and start probing away with your NICE ships (with scrubs and excess characters who aren*t being used to drain on the ground) and they are toast once they are probed. Really won*t be hard.

AGAINST PROFIT This deck will be a piece of cake since you get rid of Luke and Ben. But any ways start Mara and Dr.Evazan. Then if you feel like it you can deploy your first Emperor to the AC for an even greater force (or deploy him to TR and use Emperor’s power). Capture Luke, Circle Ben, Sense adders, Kill Han, etc. You can try to turn Luke if it suits you but the deck does fine any ways. I*ve played this deck 3 times and won all 3 with a differential of +70.

AGAINST JEDI TEST TO 6 Get Darth out fast to start draining and making opponent lose to Your Destiny. When they deploy Luke just use a Docking Bay (you can deploy the Spaceport DB to the planet they are on) or use Rise My Friend to grab him with Darth or you can just beat him down. Get Come Here You Big Coward out as well as search and destroy (if they don’t have any destiny <4 people on the table). Whenever they deploy Honer of the Jedi kick them off their battleground and then alter it. Again, you can try to turn Luke if it suits you but the deck does fine any ways. I’ve played this deck 4 times and have won all 4 with a differential of +102.

AGAINST THERE IS GOOD IN HIM Just grab Luke W/Darth and then use Barrier/E.Power/Beatdowns to win most of the battles. If you feel like it you can bring Luke to the Emperor to duel Him (use Sim Aloo to stack their destinies). If you can turn Luke do it but otherwise just drain and beat them down when they deploy. Also for the people who think ELOMS will CREAM me I need to say something to you. Eloms are so LOW forfeit that when I draw a total of 7 (with emperor’s power) they will have to lose 3 of them With only 8 Eloms in their deck and Luke and Obi gone from the picture they are dead.

NOTE. If HB is popular in your area add another scrub pilot.

THANKS for reading this and reviewing my deck. Any suggestions are welcome.
