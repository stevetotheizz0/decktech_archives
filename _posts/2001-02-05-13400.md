Card Explanations

Nightfall- allows me to get more characters out and circumvents the +6 restriction.  Also adds a destiny to total power at Tatooine sites and gives Melas power +2

Weapons- hurt an enemy fleet to get them to back off, also to reduce battle damage should I lose.

Collision- some people dislike this card since your opponent gets to chose, but if you time it right, you can give yourself an opening to attack more easily.

Corran- He is tech against bounty hunting and especially against ISB decks because of his power +3 against hunters and spies.


This is a basic battle deck that uses smugglers and spies who can be sent against your opponent both in the air and on the ground.

Signal for Nightfall first, so you can get your spies out.


Use Luke, Leia, and Lando with weapons to take on your opponent on the ground, after using I Know to get Leia out.


Matchups


SYCFA and AoBS- just keep attacking or draining wherever you can.  Use speed to go after your opponent, because the longer they have to set up, the harder your battle will be.


BHBM- keep Luke away from Vader, and work to release him if you can.  Drain heavily in space when you can.


Other decks- just use common sense and take advantage of enemy weaknesses.
