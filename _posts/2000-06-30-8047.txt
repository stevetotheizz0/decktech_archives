Strategy: '

I start out by pulling all wrapped up with twi'lek.  I can pull out docking bays to reach my opponent, and if they are in space, i'll pull out my independant ships.
   I can easilly pull out the many bounty hunters very quickly and begin to rampage across the table.  Elis for a quick battle, then get back to Tatooine using the docking bays.  I can attack with vader or mara and thier sabers to kill my opponents stronghold.  Toss in one or two bounty hunters during the fight and anyone who dies is captured.
   The imperial barriers and none shall pass should protect my characters from an EPP beat down.  Bounties give me force retrieval, as does the sarlacc.  The bubo is great for getting rid of those annoying undercover spies, or anyone who happens to get too close.
   Of course, security precautions is in there for hidden base, although i shouldn't have much trouble with my ships.'
