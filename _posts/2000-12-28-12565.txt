Strategy: '

First things first. Get BCC. then pump out the rest of your sites and sectors all with your obj.
Then put some mains at the sites with backup of some non-mains. Fortify Bespin then fortify BCC.
Drop Celebration and a traffic control and track some 7s. Retrieve with on the edges and offs. Keep their guys away w/ bespin giving their characters +1 deploy and with your huge add on power from BCC. Drain at the cloud sectors for 2 off the top and on the sites ranging from 3 to 4.
They can’t cancel or modify your drains where you have aliens and your independent starfighters and aliens are immune <4. Retrieve 5 a turn with celebration and 6 a tury with on/off the edges. keep retrieving/draining hard until they have been wiped out. Hunt down? Bring Him Before Me? Dark Jedi are defense value -1 Swing and a hit
If they are draining you too hard then drop Boushh+Meditation+Leia’s Blaster Rifle. Next turn break cover and you got destiny +4 greater then defense value LOST and 2 destiny. BEAT DOWN If they disarm her then give her a bionic hand to make it destiny +5 lost. '
