Strategy: '

alright this is how I start this deck.

get my two sites before I activate, and
drop ychf for s&d. activate deploy locations,
get cc with objective. draw.

2nd turn deploy my characters. get the east
platform if I need it, or have the force to
deploy there. dark deal is now in play,as I
get that from my objective on this turn.
insert disturbance in the force.
and if the draw was really good maybe occupation
this turn, or the turn after,etc. deploy
s&d, deploy the AO if drawn, or if piett’s
on the table and I have a comm.or gen. deployed
as well.

Alright opponents 2nd turn
they activate 1, trooper sabacc
they activate 1, cc sabacc
they activate 1, uncertain is the future.

now by design through all that action the insert
popped and they have no force. because when
that happens essentially their turn is over.

and then on your next turn dd does its damage.

this deck is about damage, DD, occupation, s&d
and AO. it’s alot real fast.

and this deck worked at dpc(not every game.)
just like described above, sabacc, my opponent
activated his 2nd force and pop. his turn
ended, and on my turn I had free drain of 10

his turn he got 1 character on cc, I kissed the
other one, and then on my turn I beat down that
character with my extra characters in hand.

this version is not as fast as Hawkin’s version
but I like it a little better For being versatile
enough to battle and I have cc sabacc for a little
retrieval as well as trigger the disturbance. and I will probably do some
extra tweeking with it, more ships, and get
xizor in here, cause he’s BUFF
