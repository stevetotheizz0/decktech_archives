This is a deck that has sort of worked for me. but since i’ve never done a sanctioned tournament, i don’t really know. i try to convert Vader. If no Vader is around, then the dark side loses force, i drain on Endor, and if i feel lucky, maybe play in the asteroids with the A-wings. The space and ground have good scrapping power, so if all else fails...anyways, i love constructive criticism, so any and all suggestions are appreciated '
