Strategy: '

The main goal of this deck is to win. You use retrieval, draining and battling to achieve this goal. Some cards may seem out of place, so here are some card choice explanations. 

Starting EBG To get maintenance droids out, especially the Bantha Droid to cancel Lateral damage at the system, which is deadly against WYS. Also, Leebo is an added character to get, or if you need power in space you can pull him to pull the Outrider. Just an overall good card. Also the opponent may think that you are using Rogue 3 and Wedge or something. 

Obi&#8217;s Journal deploy on Luke, so your drains can&#8217;t be canceled or modified there. Also, may cancel weapon destiny at same site (like a tracked seven with Dengar against Luke, or against another character. Another good card to have in any deck with lightsabers.

Local Defense Well, it is a very tech card, because you can pull an independent ship from reserve and then play again from lost pile. I played this in a WYS deck against the state champion and even he did not know what it did so it is an underused card for how tech it is. 

General Play of this deck

Early Game Try to get set up with starships at the systems and a few pepl on the ground to flip.  Set up the Celebration and get your drains and retrieval going.  Win the race and keep on going to the&#8230;.

Mid-Game You should have no lost pile now due to racing, I Did It And the celebration. If you don&#8217;t have the celebration out by now, set it up. Win some battles and get bigger drains going. Take out their characters with Fallen Portal and use Artoo I Have A Bad Feeling About This to limit their destiny. Those two and the tripler card will win you battles for big amounts. Play Artoo I have a bad feeling, Rug Hug and Don&#8217;t Get @#$%y from lost pile to win big battles also. You should have eliminated most of their characters by now, so you should be able to sit back and win. 

End-Game Not much to do here, just drain and retrieve. If they get some drains going, your retrieval will be enough to handle it, so just coast along to the&#8230;.

Win The easiest part of the game. Just clean up your cards, and go report that you won by 32 to the TD. This is the most used game phase in a tourney. You use it 6 times.

I know that pepl will mention that I don&#8217;t have enough sites to get celebration going well. I start with three, and I have one more. That is more than enough to get a sufficient celebration going, with all of the other retrieval in the deck. I would really like to have the I Know trick in here, but I don&#8217;t have I Know so that sucks. It would just be added tech, so it&#8217;s not necessary. This deck still wins. 

All matchups are the same except for any space deck. Devote any and all pilots to the cause of holding Tatooine systems. Put Talon, Luke, the Raiders, Artoo and Threepio, and Lando on the ground for drains and celebration at two sites. 

Thanks for reading and reviewing my deck, and good luck to anyone who plays this Thanks once again, 
The future world champ, Phil
