Cards: 

'Okay, before we get to the cards, I just want everyone to notice. This deck is created for the Battle Of Endor tournament style, which means cards only from Endor, DSII, and the starter decks from DSII. I'm sure that a few mouth-breathing, slack-jawed yokels will miss this whole fact and suggest I throw in Capt. Han and the Super Falcon, or tell me to put in some SAC protection, but I'm hoping that most of you will realize that I have no need of most of these. Anyhoo, on to the deck.

Strategy: '

Okay, I'll say it again in case you may have missed my disclaimer (I trust you read it up there, but you never know.) This deck is constructed specifically for the Battle Of Endor tournament environment, meaning I can only use cards from Endor, DSII, and the DSII starter decks (in this case, A Few Maneuvers and Grimtaash.) Okay, moving along. The basic idea is to deploy massive amounts of people to Endor and battle the hell out of your opponent. I thank the #1 ranked dude (sorry, I forgot your name) for giving me a bunch of ideas for this deck. Foremost was the idea to not bother blowing up the Bunker, as it's kind of card intensive and doesn't do much for me. Basically, use Strike Planning to get Crix and Lando, use Crix to pull scouts and Lando to get the Falcon to defend Endor. Spread out when you have enough scouts to flip the objective.

Specifics

Corporal Midge- He has a funny name, but he really helps your drains once you flip.

Corporal Kensaric- He should be the first guy that Crix pulls, since he makes your opponent pay through the ass to deploy.

A Few Maneuvers- Comes in the starter decks. Easily cyclable 6. 'Nuff said.

Grimtaash- In BOE, Interceptors will be popular. This will help cut down on the riffraff a little.

Luke- What the hell do you think he's in here for? He's the most powerful character in the game.

Anyhoo, let me know what you think. Remember, it's BATTLE OF ENDOR ONLY. Sorry to keep reminding you, but there's always going to be someone who gives me a crappy rating because "RalOps will rip this deck a new one." In BOE, I don't have to worry about RalOps. Anyway, thanks for your input. '
