Strategy: 

This is your standard Rallitir Operations/Chicken Walker deck.	You use the reacting Walkers to lock down the planet and send out Vader/Tarkin, Tempest 1/Igar, and Mara Jade hit squads to knock off your opponent.

I played against a Hidden Base deck and I beat it by draining on the ground and pinging him with Search & Destroy.	I then played a Yavin IV Throne Room start and I beat him by out activating him first couple of turns, (read the report of that game by dvader).  I then played Kyle Craft and his Yavin IV deck and he beat me by 11 or so.  This deck can work very fast, but unless you start with Cruch against a Yavin IV deck, you lose.

If I played this deck again I would make the following changes.
 - I would add another BH ship or such, maybe a Dreadnaught.
 - I would add one more Twix site.
 - I would actually add a second evader, considering I forgot to even write it into the deck list.
