strat 


i’ve searched for a new light deck, after i played my last regional with QMC i needed a new fresh deck, so i decided

to try light side combat, it looks pretty nice to me after i had played against it in the regionalfirst i played it with

3 effects but later on i recognized that their is no force retrieval and with this high dests it will be cool to race, so 

put in podrace and just "Sai’torr Kal Fas" for my jedis at naboo.


try to pull out fast jedis to naboo so you will give fast high drains it’s very simple and there is no really new strat or 

amazing ideas from me



Why Alter?


alter is tech, yoda will pull it out and later on in the game you will recognize why alter is a biest card, example scam or 

other s.ucking effects


thx for reading/rating this deck
