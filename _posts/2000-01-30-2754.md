Strategy: '

*Use Pucumir, Harc Seff, and Kebyc to help raise your and reduce their force draining
*Lightsabers on mains to enhace force drains
*Insurrection + ability 2 rebels to have high forfeits
*Cloud City Clebration to retrieve force
*Fleet + Incom Engineer to ensure control of Bespin and B Cloud City
*Path of Least Resistance and Revolution are just annoying cards to use
*It's Not My Fault is a card I don't see much, but has a 5 destiny, helps with protecting EPPs, and is a used interrupt instead of lost
*Obi-Wan's Cape is to protect EPPs
*Fire Quad Laser, then, if you miss, fire Intruder Missle for a +3 destiny.  The 7s and 4 on the starship weapons are also nice
