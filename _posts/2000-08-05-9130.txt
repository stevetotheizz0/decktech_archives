Strategy: '

This deck is a combination of TIGIH and your basic run-of-the-mill beatdown deck. The basic idea is to win enough battles to convert Vader or beat/drain your opponent to death. The strategy is pretty much the same as your average beatdown deck. Many of the Interrupts and Effects are in there for the dual purpose of hampering certain strategies and for their high destiny. All that is necessary to convert Vader should be to win three battles, and that's what beatdown decks are good at. I haven't gotten to try this deck yet, but will update once I have. Please let me know what you think of it, and what you think should be changed. I really need some reviews to boost my Decktech rating, so I thank you for your input.'
