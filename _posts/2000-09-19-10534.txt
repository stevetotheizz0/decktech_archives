Strategy: 

Start with DTF, Squad Assignments, and Wise Advice.  Get out some systems and ships to them.  Get the Bacta Tank out early so you can save Luke and them.	Don’t need sites in this deck because your opponent will probably have some.  Flip your Objective as soon as you have all your systems out, do not be afraid of SP because first of all they have to occupy the system to probe it, how the hell they gonna do that against this deck?
