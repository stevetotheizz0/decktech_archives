Strategy: '

use HFTMF to start strike planning, staging areas, and insurrection.

while they activate first turn, use strike planning to pull madine and/or general solo, if you think you are safe from scanning crews. use madine to pull panno, since he give extra activation.

just get set up, and win lots of battles. that is the idea, isnt it? use the blaster profs to make hit characters lost, and to try and keep them from drawing a BD. if they do get a BD, use the insertion plannings that are in there. there are 8 in the deck (yes, i know..grabbers but they also have a very nice destiny of 6, which is pretty damn good) try and get leia han and chewie down asap (madine lets you pull chewie of kashyyyk). put leias gun and meditation on leia. that will let her add a BD, and make her gun fire at destiny +4 > defense and they are immeadately lost (pretty sweet, eh?) just use staging areas to get a high activation on the second turn, from moving luke to the DB, or just D some scrubs there. this deck has no problem with activation, between the +2 from luke, the ithorians (great for drains), the sites, panno, and DoS, you should have no problem with force (the landing site lets your endor rebels deploy -1, which lets most of your guys D for 1 force.) use the signal to get out the other effects asap. use wedge in RS1 and red leader in red 1 to blow up the DSII if they try that crap with you. with wedge (using proton torps) and RLiR1

in response to the 8 insertion plannings
"grabbers will hurt you" -- yes, they will, but they are also great for the destiny of a six they provide, not to mention they are used interrupts, and are easily tracked.

i didnt have time to write a more detailed strategy, but i am sure you have the brain power to figure it out, it isnt a complicated deck. if you dont have the brain power, why the hell are you reviewing this?
