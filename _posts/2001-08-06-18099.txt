Strategy: '

Don’t expect much here, after all it is a Fear deck.  Whenever you get a fear, play it.

Battle whatever they have on the ground and just leave space alone, the deck can drain, but against a Flipping HB deck it’s not going to work.

With 5 Visages, I’d like to see them try to keep it off the table.

It says I’m supposed to convince you that the deck has a shot at winning, fact of the matter is, it will probably only win against scrubs.

Hope I wasted your time, later. '
