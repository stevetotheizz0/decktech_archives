Strategy: '

Ok this is a straight forward Docking bay deck.
The docking bays that you might want early are
Home One docking bay
And
Echo Docking Bay

drop someone at the home one docking bay so they dont get aboard.
You will start building up your forces with stuff like the Dresselians and Endor scout troppers
Use take the initiative and Insertion Planning to make your destiny draws hurt where they count, the site.
Drop luke with the Jedi lightsaber and start your hack and slash battles slowly dropping those pesky troopers and aliens fast.

Changes that can be made
By all means replace Luke with Jedi Luke if you got them
The Jedi Light saber can be replaced with lukes
And the Endor scout troppers and dresselians can be replaced with better charachters like obi-wan and Mirax
This so far is my first trek into the Meta of both air and ground so tell me what you think with any Comments
