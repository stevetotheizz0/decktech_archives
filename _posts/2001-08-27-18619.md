Strategy: '

I just built this deck so i haven’t had to the time to play it in tourneys. Basicly just set up your sentators and use Mindful of the Future to pull out your sites along with Insurrection. Use the political effects to add 3 if u know your going to battle or use secure route and the political effect to drain for up to 7 at the naboo battle plains. 2 from the site, 2 from secure route, 2 from the effect and 1 from luke’s or anakins lightsaber. Use mercenary armor on leia to protect her from attrition and have fun with the deck. I posted the deck for some advice so please leave a comment. Thanks '
