Strategy: '

you start the hut for activation and stone piles play their, wise advice to protect agianst sac if i don’t have a sense in my hand, plus play grabbers for free staging areas and insurrection for docking bay’s first turn u pull home one docking bay and play some characters their, two systems for extra drains in case my opponent plays no space, green squad a-wings play minus two to sullust, projection to stop small db drains or slow any other drains menace fades for dark deal and other drain decks, hotj for huntdown, stone pile wat can i say i love playing that card and starting the hut means no problem playing it, i love sac ote to stop them from running away the character selection is pretty obciouse.
