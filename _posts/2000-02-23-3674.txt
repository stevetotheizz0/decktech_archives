Strategy: 

My main objective is to get the sites out get lando to the casino with a dev
get pucimer out as fast as i can and drain and sabacc
i get the dev swarm going they are so expendable they play sabacc and i just
go for the cc celebration
i can retreive up to 10 a turn in an ideal situation
I kill with drains cause noone wants to come to CC and get
it handed to em.  I can even leave guys alone at a site i just
ventilation shaft them when vader and tarkin arrive
against anything as long as the retreive engine is working i can win
i know it sounds impossible but when im draining for as much as im retrieving its hard
to take me out.
not alot of ships i know but i hold bespin okay if i can get at least 2 of em down at once
plus if i get the vettes down devs are pilots too so thats why
devs are so sweet
