****END EDIT****



This is the BHBM deck Ive been playing for some time now and its been working for me only losing to a Watch your step deck and a flipping HB deck which after that happend I put the Sec Precautions back in.  This deck has mass activation and alot of answers for most LS decks with fast damage and high destiny.


Here are some Card Explanations.


Security Precautions  For that crazy hidden base every once in a while.  Even if no HB can play early game for more activation.


Put All Sections on Alert  Cancels Rebels text like sucide Obis or First turn luke against Emp.

Also good for beatdown.


Imbalance  Great anti retrieval better than Serect Plans in my opinion because they get retrieval but makes them lose force instead which is what the games all about.


You cannot hide forever  Just in case of that numbers card every once in a while.  Plus pulls battle order of something else.


Young Fool  Kills Objs like Princess and Profit or Obi to get rid of that guy.


Battle Deployment  You always need a AO to replace that killer Ill take the leader.  Plus with my caps and starships makes for a beatdown.


Everything else to me looks standard so if you have any questions about other card picks just d-mail me.


What do I do?

Heres how I do my first turn

I pull Rendilli before i activate.  Now your next move all depends on your hand.  If you have a Put All Sections on Alert put Emp at D* dbay for a quick drain if not go to the D*2 dbay and deploy Rendilli.  If by next turn you dont have Janus or Vader play some kinda back up and draw for them.


vs matchups


vs Watch your step


Get Rendilli like normal.  Pull D*2 dbay and put Emperor to Cantina with hopefully Janus or Sim.  If not either play there anyways and pull Force Lightning to kill off some scrub.  Use Mara and Vader with Sniper/Dark Strike to kill off more guys.  Try to get lots of cards stacked because its hard to go straight up against WYS so you can go cross Luke.  Try to get Battle Deployment with Ships at Tatooine so they only draw 1 bd at all sites.  Tough Matchup.


vs There is good in Him


Play Emperor to Endor Dbay with Rendilli and D*2 dbay for more activation.  If they give up Luke which they should hope you have Vader in your hand so you dont suck 3 for the first turn.  Only DUEL when your sure you can win.  Pick the battles carefull.  The D* dbay is your best friend in this matchup.  Use Mara to kill of Crix if hes at H1 dbay.  Hit up drains at your Throne Room with Vaders saber and presence.  Play battle order with ships at rendilli to lock down.  Tough Matchup


vs  Hidden Base flip


Get emperor to D*2 dbay trying to choke them play Rendilli for more force.  Hopefully play Janus or vader 2nd turn to either 1 of your battleground dbays to hit them with Your Destiny early game.  Search and Destroy is your best friend.  Hold the Security precautions and your ships till they filp and your ready to probe.  I dont duel against this deck because id rather have the drains and lose 1 keeping search and destroy going rather than hidding them for 3.  Should be easy if you get Search and Destory going with a Probed hidden base.


vs Hidden base retrieval


Get the D* dbay hopefull holding a Put All Sections on Alert or Projective otherwise go with D*2 dbay.  Try to get rid of their characters as much as possible.  Get the dueling set up with the Presence going.  Try to kill off their super falcon.  Use Imbalance to stop the retrieval use Battle Order and your Aliens to clear characters.


vs Rescue the Princess


This is easy matchup.  Get Emperor to their D* dbay pulling Rendilli and D*2 dbay hopefully get Janus with a Put All Sections or Projective again but doubtful.  Try to get Young Fool with force lightning because when they move that lift tube they have to get out for a split second where you can lightning and Young Fool for out of play Leia.  If you cant get that going Move someone like Mara or someone with a gun into the war room to play a sniper on Leia when she moves over.


vs Training


Get Vader out as fast as you can.  When they give you Luke go back and duel hopefully getting No escape out early so Honor doesnt effect.  Try to cover your 2 dbays and get Search and destroy going.  Play presence on Throne Room so their trainee has to come there to get their extra desitny when they you just play Dark Strike to kill them off.  


vs EBO


Get Emp to D* dbay since they really cant make a strike first turn.  Get search and destroy going with big drains.  Only go to space when you can win with a Lateral or something.  Normally dont duel unless your search and destroy is lost or something else.  Try to win battles to cross but if you cant stick to dueling and some drains.


If Ive missed anything sorry but I cant think of anything else.  Its a great deck to play and wins often.  If you have any questions D-mail me.  Check out my next TR when you can to see it in action.  Thanks for looking.  '
