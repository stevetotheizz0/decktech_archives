Strategy: '

It’s still the Machine, with a few minor changes. People told me that I may have trouble if I dont get out A new secret Base, so I added another one. I also Ditched the red squad x-wings for some more non-unique bad boys. This deck is almost 100% more effecient now. I get out a new secret base on the first turn every game, at least I have so far. (12-0) Here’s the regualr Strategy

		 Well this deck is a mean EBO deck. You dont start
		 off like normal EBO decks, so they will probobly
		 think you are playing "Deadbolt". YOu have to get
		 out A new secret base early, so you can set up the
		 deck. You have 3 signals in there, plus 2 of a new secret base,  so it shouldnt be a
		 problem. YOu have Perfect SAC in this deck, they
		 have to lose sense plus 2 force, and your card goes
		 back to your deck. Once you get out ANSB, search
		 for your sites first. Then get out EB garrison and get
		 out your guys that you can search for (luke, wedge,
		 zev). Deploy Boussh and Tk-422 to block some
		 drains, plus you have Rebel fleet and Projection to
		 help slow down thier drains. Get out Incom, drop
		 some x-wings and drain like crazy. If they are dumb
		 ebough to battle, Play Collision, Out of Nowhere,
		 Rebel barrier, Organized attack, ect and you will still
		 win. Even if they drop dengar will 8 x-wings, you
		 power will still be way more than thiers. (oh, you have power 20 to my 35, HA HA) Ok, lets see
		 some matchups

		 Huntdown This deck has a chance against you.
		 Cancle Visage with spies or transmition term. Keep
		 Insight out in case of numbers. If they bring a crew to
		 hoth, set up EBO first, then run luke to thier docking
		 bays using the hoth DB. They cant transit out, but
		 you can. Then they flip back. If they Pick up vader,
		 just transit back and they have to run under the
		 shields all over again. They wont have a huge amount
		 of space, so you should hold your ground (air) in
		 space.

		 MKOS this can hurt. Most play with that effect that
		 doesnt let you cancel thier drains. All you can do is
		 out drain them in space. Retrive will All wings and
		 Firgin Dan to win

		 BHBM Give them Jedi luke (thats why he is in
		 there) early, so they lose a force at the end of thier
		 turns. Beat down whatever they have in space, and
		 out drain them like crazy. You have SAC control so
		 senses and alters wont be a problem. THis should be
		 an easy game.

		 Ties You should over power them always. Invade
		 Wekelumi and take it over. You should win this
		 game.

		 Manipulation HA You have protection from just
		 about everything including Monnok Myoom onith
		 wont have time to kill of males, they will all be out
		 before she can. You WIN

		 Anything Else Play as ussual. Never Forget your
		 CIval Dissorder, and force drains. Retvriving with
		 Figrin dan each turn is a must.

		 Hope You enjoyed the deck If you use it, and crush
		 people with it, be shure to mail me and say so.
		 THANKS FOR REVIEWING
