Mirax and Ishi Tib

For tracking


Baragwin

for retrieving my green cards


Beggar * Draw their Fire

Beat down combo


I hope she`s ok

against any kind of space decks


Old school Luke

Against BHBM deploy him to H1 DB in your first turn. Also useful for his ship.



Why only three ships?

Go to space if you can beat him down with Superfalcon and/or Monster Dash.


Why no SAC protection?

I did not see SAC for a long time



Matchups

Against space decks

Start Obi`s Hut with Insurrection, St. Areas and YISYW. Search for I hope she`s ok.

Try to drain him and retrieve. Go to space when he does not expect this. Landing Claw will be helpful.


Against Scum

Start with Obi`s Hut and the palace, but only if you can convert his JP.

Play like a Mains and toys.


Against Dark Side Mains and Toys

Start Obi`s Hut and Ins., SAreas and YISYW.

Play smart, retrieve, track your destinies and try avoid battle unless you want to battle.
