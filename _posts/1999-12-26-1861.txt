Strategy: 

Did I say I like manipulation ? I think that the best way to use the new objective is speed.  Tactical support is the key card of the deck. If you get one early you should be able to set up the deal on turn 3. Once opponent deployed something you just play that one card to get your beatdown squad: barich, irol and drelosyn are power 6 on CC and draw 3 destinies, two themselves and one that you substract from opponent. Add in a trooper assault and opponent is likely to loose some cards over the top. Boba in slave 1 in your starting hand is so awesome, you can set up dark deal and then get up to bespin to satisfy battle plan. Against testdecks, track a masterful move and set for stun the apprentice. You can look through your deck the first three turns at least, so you know when set for stun is in your force pile. If they grabble masterful move, occupation has to do the damage, its saver anyway against surprise assaults. 6 scanning crews might not be sufficient but its not finetuned yet. Any comments are
welcome.
