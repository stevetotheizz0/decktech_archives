Objective:
Hidden Base/Systems Will Slip Through Your Fingers


Strategy: 

You should always start with Yarna d&#8217;al&#8217; Gargan so you won&#8217;t have to suffer from monnoks. Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to know if you want to flip the objective or not. It might get scary if the opponent has a security precations. The 2 Order To Engage can mess up any imperial fleet. Just follow his starships everywhere and make him take the hard choice of battling your greater forces or losing 3 force. 3 force hurts bad. Order To Engage can also be used in a satisfying way in a combo with Rebel Barrier. I think the pair of kessel&#8217;s are needed because a force drain of 3 every turn should be painful for the opponent. Just don&#8217;t deploy kessel too early in the game, giving the opponent extra force-generation. Maybe this deck needs another Ultimatum for protection against Odds. But if you really should need ultimatum, use Tunnel Vision. Cloud City works fine as a sanctuary from those big imperial destroyers. Just remember to watch out for Lateral Damage if you encounter an imperial space-deck&#8230;
