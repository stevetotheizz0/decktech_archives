Strategy: '

A normal game goes as follows

Turn 1 I Usually activate about 3-5. I search my reserve deck for Endor and deploy it. I deploy awings I have to rendezvous point, then I draw. My deploying on my first turn ussually makes my opponent feel a bit underconfident.

Turn 2 I activate now about 5-7. I search for kessel. I deploy what I have in my hand and move all of them in to rendezvous point.

Turn 3 I search for system. Deploy and move in.


I keep on repeating this cycle and spread out until I have a fairly good control of space. Then I flip it. '
