**RESPONSES TO SOME CRITICISM**

1.  Space doesn’t wreck me all that much.  I spread out, and it’s a drain race.  If one is so fearful of space beatdown, then I Hope She’s All Right would be a useful addition.  Also, I can work more retrieval than TIEs can.

2.  In almost every game I’ve played with this deck, I’ve flipped.   The Lift Tubes get Leia to Y4 on the turn you free her, and then if they don’t come after her, I flip.  If they do, then she dies, and I drop another one from my hand and move her over.  Also, she is protected by Fallen Portal, and if on the Death Star, Lift Tube Escape.  As stated below, you can drop a character to protect her as well.

3.  Force generation is a problem, yes.  Rendezvous Point and Staging Areas are in to help cope with this.  This deck HAS beaten a Hunt Down AND a BHBM deck that choked me out of Force.

4.  8D8 x3 and starting EBG isn’t excessive.  Vs. Scum, when I start Seeking An Audience, I’ll need 3 in order to draw one faster.  Also, it’s tech w/ HDWGITM?.  I have a droid on table, pull 8D8, which adds an extra card into my hand that I didn’t have before, then Mess.

Starting

Rescue The Princess/SIAEM, D* Detention Block Corridor, Prisoner 2187, D* DB327, Yavin 4 DB, Yavin 4 Massassi War Room, The Signal for Echo Base Garrison


Strategy

First turn, pull 8D8 and move him along to meet Prisoner (use Lift Tubes to get him there faster, and Prisoner back faster).  Flip as fast as you can, then use your mains to ravage the DS ranks and place uniques out of play.  If worried about Prisoner getting worked on her way to Yavin 4, drop some protection (best would be Luke (except vs. HD dueling + BHBM) if you have Skywalkers in hand).

With Prisoner 2187 and the D*DBC, you should have some good drains going in the end.

Surprise Assault as many of their drains as you safely can, and use D* Plans and On The Edge to retrieve when necessary.

As long as you have a D* Plans not in lost pile, keep 2 Lift Tubes on table so as to complete them in 2 turns.  Every time you draw a Lift Tube, deploy it and use Lift Tube Escape to recirculate and track it.

Use HDWGITM? if and when your hands arent good. If youre not getting enough Force generation, then drop people to the DBs w/ Staging Areas out, and use Fallen Portal if they come after you.


Vs.

Hunt Down Use spies to cancel Visage.  Flip fast and go after Vader.  Once hes gone, mop up whatever else comes your way.  Sit on Executor sites and drain away.


BHBM Play offensively and wait for your opponent to make the first move.  If Vader hits table, and youre nowhere close to flipping, then give them Jedi Luke.  You should win many duels.  If youre about to flip, then eat Your Destiny damage, then use your non-Luke characters to ice Vader.  After that, EPP Luke is a suicide main.


Scum Start Seeking An Audience instead of EBG, and first turn deploy Artoo to the Y4DB.  Next turn, pull A Gift and play it on Threepio (pulled by SAA).  Draw for Ounee Ta, then go into the Palace.  Against MKOS, target Bib and/or Jabba first, so that they dont get the objective bonus; then go after Myo (or whatever other Rep).  Against Court, take the fight to them and get rid of all their hunters.  Against ISB-ORS, be careful.  Theyll have to pay to drain, so try to pick off their biggest drain sites first.


Non-Scum ISB Go after the ISB agents aggressively to make them OOP.


Black Sun Kill off Xizor once flipped.  Thats game right there.  '
