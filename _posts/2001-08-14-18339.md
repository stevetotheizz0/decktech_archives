Strategy: '

Edit@@@@@ Cut out the two elises, and add two imperial supplies, because they help deal + Occ

to get set up quick


Any Suggestions are welcome, this deck is very 

new to me, and it is only in the first stages of 

playtesting, but I will try my best to convey the

true power of this deck.


Strategy


The Cards 


Fighter Cover My ships are power +3 when they 

fire a weapon in battle, they can re-draw 

their starship weapon destinies, and you 

characters at related sites add one to each of

their weapon destinies and their immunity to 

attrition is +2.


I Cant Shake Him Add a destiny in battle or 

pull a starship weapon from your reserve deck

great against QMC, you can give Ten Numb a run 

for his money.


I have not play this deck very extensively, but I

will give you the matchups I have played.


Matchups


QMC Use Bewil to stop path and smash them off 

cloud city in space and on the ground, dont

let them make a move, DD and CC occ should take

care of it. No a very difficult matchup.


Watch Your Step Shoot down the outrider, falcon,

etc. Drain for tons, take over the cantina,

but be careful, so tons of damage quick, if they

win the podrace it dosent matter because your

doing 10-15 damage a turn. Use elis to smack them 

around. Play smart, and you should win, but

still a tough matchup. 


Slave Quarter Mains They wont touch you in space

use battle order to slow them down, their destinys

will be resticted by crush, use you use huge saber

destinies to slice up mains. Firly tough matchup,

just play smart.


In the second version I will update the matchups

and card selections


Thanks for Reading and Reviewing
