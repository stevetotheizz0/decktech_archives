Strategy: 

First thing to do is pull the generals and then activate. Then use Insurrection to look for a docking bay and to check what’s in your force pile. If you drew a signal or ANSB play it and get what you need. If it all goes right you should always have it set up second turn. On the second turn all you need to grab is EBO, if you didn’t draw it. Get Incom Corp. out quick. Use the Baragwins and Figrin D’an to retrieve your cards. The catapults are in there just for the destiny. Drawing a 7 really hurts the other guy. I hevn’t taken this to any tourneys or anything yet, so any advice is appreciated.
