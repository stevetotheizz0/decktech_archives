Strategy: 

Now then, the hard part. i really suck at this strategy thing, but here goes.

I play Coruscant Alter, it cancels political affects.
Force lightnings arent a must, but they are nice. you can take one out for another weapon lev, which are always nice to have
one i have you now is good, once you play it once, they become afraid of it, and chances are, youll retrieve it.
i run 3 PRC, and 2 hit racer, hit racer is too dependable on the situation, where is PRC is pretty generic
Neimodian Advisor is one of the best cards in coruscant, hands down

Why no vader sticks? epp and choke both have a battle "shot"
Marketplace+keder the black+Janus=nopoliticiansforthem

i was thinking of taking out some stuff for bounty hunter ships, but locally, no new light decks do the space thing.

well, good luck
