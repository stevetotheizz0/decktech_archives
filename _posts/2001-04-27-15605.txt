Strategy: '

as i said i havent played it yet so i dont have much of a stratagy.

start Massasi Base Ops, and all of its locations

use your cap. ships to support the fighters. the Rebel trooper recruits are power +1 to another recruit at the same site (at least thats the way i use the recruits game text)


Thanks,
Anthony
