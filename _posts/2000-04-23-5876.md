Objective (1)
ISB Operations/Empire's Sinister Agents '

Strategy: '

Start ISB. Get Tat. Sites. Drain, occupy, S&V, etc. DON'T GO OFF TATOOINE Stay on Tatooine, Drain + Occupy for 12+. Stick 5D6 on their planet, and ABC. They don't drain. Retrieve an ORS per turn. Den to cancel drains. Once-per-game Abyssin Ornament.  Went 3-0 at Washington States. Major props to Nicholas 'Olas' Burke for making the original deck (that I heavily modified). Also props to Keith 'Gen' for letting me borrow some ORSs

*To the stupid reviewer who said I should use Scum and Villany LOOK AT MY DECKLIST SCUM AND VILLANY x2 Geez...

I will be posting a v2 of this in 10 days... '
