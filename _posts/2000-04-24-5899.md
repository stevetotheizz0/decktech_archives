Strategy: '

Start with the 3 sites stated. T16s deploy free to Beggars Canyan, so dump them all from your hand (if you can) first turn. Deploy other characters to sites as needed. Invade Ralltiir with T16s to prevent RO from flipping. Remember, they can 'react' as well.
Use Covert Landing to add a destiny in a battle. Rapid Fire to deploy the Power Harpoon and then Slight Weapons Malfunction to add another destiny. The T16s are forfeit 4 and can't be hit by Sabers, Concussion Rifles, Blaster Rifles, Mortor Guns, Riot Guns, Stun Rifles, etc.
With Maneuvering Flaps, even though they can't move, they will be power & forfeit +2.
The Incom Engineers add 2 to your destiny and make the T16s immune to attrition < 3. Combine that with the 2X droid (even in the daylight) and now they are immune to attrition < 5. How do you ask? 2X is a security droid you say? Let's take a close look at the LORE for the droid. 'Simple maintenance and diagnostics droid.' There's your keyword maintenance. That qualifies him for the combo.
Other than that, just your standard stuff. Have fun

**UPDATE - 4/25/00 - For you nay-sayers out there that say the maintenance part in the lore of the 2X droid doesn't work, I ask you... is Obi-Wan Kenobi a General? Yes he is. Same principle. Be sure to read page 35 of the Glossary under CHARACTERISTICS.	 '
