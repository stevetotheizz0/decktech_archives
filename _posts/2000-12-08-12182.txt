Starting Cards
Dantooine- CS deploy -2, Starfighters -1
DTF- so I know where it is

Basically come together to battle or spread out to drain.  If your opponent is playing space, overwhelm them while they are setting up.  If they are playing ground, spread out and drain, while holding them back with a few of your pilots on the ground.
Use Ackbar to pull whatever or whoever you need at the time.
Deploy one of the HTBs on the Nebulon-B, since it deploys free.
Deploy one of the X-wing LCs on Red Squad 4 for its 2Force x=3

Against BHBM- hit hard and fast, before they can kill you for not having Luke.
Against Endor Ops- hold them with General Solo and some others for Rebel Leadership, while leaving the Chewie in the Falcon.
Against Big Blue- use your bigger blue against them  '
