Strategy: 

Here’s my AOTBS deck I have been playing for a while. It’s kinda unoriginal but I haven’t posted anything for a while so I decided to post it. Get Xizor & Palpy to battlegrounds to start the damage and sense/alter nasty interrupts. 

This is a good battling deck which activates a lot. Play it and see how good it is. Thanks, COK (auuuuuugggggg)
