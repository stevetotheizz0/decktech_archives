Strategy: '

I’ve been playing Chadra Fans for a long time. But only as a fun deck. Now with JPSD, I think that they are a force to be reckoned with.

First turn pull out Bo Shuda. Then you need to get your aliens to the chamber. You can either draw for them or use You Will Take Me to Jabba Now (YWTMTJN). Here is a list of the aliens you need at the chamber

Tessek Adds to your drains and Chadra Fans are deploy -1.

Kabe Your rep. Chadras are power and forfeit +2

Rennek Stops Bubo from spoiling your plans
Soth Petikin This gut is the stuff  He allows you to pull scouts, thieves, and spies. ie Lando with Vibro Axe, Chadra Fans, Kabe, Bothan Spy, Tedn Dahai.

Tedn Dahai This guy is Tech You need him. Ephant Mon will ruin your day. Because Kabe is a thief, Ephant Mon prevents Kabe from deploying to the chamber if is already there. Here is his text if you don’t know what he does

For each other musician at same site,during any control phase you may use 1 Force to choose one opponent’s alien present. That alien cannot utilize its game text for remainder of that turn.

This allows you to cancel Ephant’s text and to deploy Kabe to the chamber. The musician I chose was Oola to use this text. Don’t tell me to use Figrin Dan because he is a gambler, and thus cannot deploy to the same site as Ephant.

Here is a list of the other characters in here

Arleil Schous This guy is the key to beatdown.
Chadra Fans are deploy -1 to same Tatooine site. That means, and also because of Tessek, Chadra Fans are deploy ZERO at Tatooine sites Can you smell smackdown?

Geezum Pulls Tatooine sites out of your deck

Lando with Vibro Axe This guy is a GOD  I think you already know that.

EPP Luke To give to Vader against BHBM

Flip the objective when you feel it is safe. This usually means that you have It’s A Trap or you have enough forfeit bait to absorb any battle damage that may occur. What I do is leave one Chadra Fan at a Tatooine site to bait them into coming down. If they fall for it, It’s A Trap the battle. Then apply the smackdown with free Chadra Fans with Arliel Schous.

There really is not much to this deck. Just spread out and drain and keep yourself out of trouble. Then look out for opportunities for a beatdown.

Please give some constructive reviews, as I would like to make this deck better.
