Strategy: 

Well here's a rare deck but LMK what you think.
In this deck there are lots of high destiny cards that also have good game texts which ROCKS. This allows me to win almost all the duels I initiate (since most light decks with mains don't have awesome destinies). This deck also can do some nice beat downs and with the high destinies it's awesome.

AGAINST Hidden Base (X-Wing ect): If they get sloppy cream them with your ships, otherwise just get SP out and wait for them to flip. Then probe for their base with your ships. Use Visage to your advantage and spread drain on the ground.

AGAINST OMDH: Start Secret Plans. Then just drain W/your ability 4 people and in space as well as duel with Darth & Tarkin. Also take out most of their characters and when they make an OMDH run they won't retrieve much.

AGAINST PROFIT: If your Lucky you'll get Tatooine: JP, or JP: Audience Chamber. If you do convert their sites and that hurts a lot. Again try to drain but mostly focus on dueling and getting Han (shouldn't be hard if they don't have Obi/Luke out. If they do have them out then duel)

Thanks for Looking.
