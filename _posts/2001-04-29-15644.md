Strategy: '

Like I said before its a sucky deck, but if you could help at all tell me.  Thanks again. The startagey here is power battle at @#$% few places as possible and it is a long shot but it sometimes getts 80 power if I have all the right cards. I know that it sucks but pleease help me fix it up. '
