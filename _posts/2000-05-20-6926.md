Strategy: '

Not sure what to say , pretty standard stuff.
Always start Imperial Arrest Order and get your
AT-ST Pilots out on the AT-STs for quick battle
destinies . Revo might be a problem and if it is
then you should switch a few things around for
Crush the Rebellion and Evaders ( BDControls ,
a Trample , the Barrier , maybe a grappler ).  '
