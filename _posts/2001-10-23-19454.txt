Strategy: 

 Fist turn activate a pitiful 2 force+whatever the opponet gives you.Pull out a docking bay and deploy a agent there for the +2 activation.
Next turn get the other docking bay out and any other locations d a nem advisior if you have one, use the Twilleek’s to pull out Expand the empire or a prsence of the force.Flip objective and drain like mad and maybe occupation and suns down if you can get the system out
     Use the hard mains to ”babysit” your ISB’s while you drain for about 11 a turn!!!

     When I use this deck it normally comes 3rd in a local tournament but here is a list in how to beat other decks
  WYS: Hide and run like a coward as they will beat you down for mutiple battle destiny or pile up your chracters.
  TIGIH: Drain Race !!!! Get a higher drain than the opponent and you shoukd win 
  EBO: Dont even think about going to space but dont let on that you dont have any other wise thet will whack one xwing at a location
  Hyperdrive: Again be very cautious as they will want to initiate battle for the retrival.
  Oh and sorry for the dodgy numbers on ther list as i pasted from word and I will Know for next time to do it on a pad!!
