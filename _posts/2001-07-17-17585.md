Strategy: '

this is like a rehash of the deck everyone was playing 6 months ago, now it’s more fun because of qui-gon.


also you should fit ounee ta in there, i almost lost to a ralops deck


in any case if you dont know how hidden mains works you should be ashamed of yourself, basically you dont flip but you use the objective’s text to pull systems for force gen. then you get your guys out and battle and drain and win. and you use on/off edge with tracked destiny to retrieve everything.


nothing spectacular


i played this deck at a local just for fun, sure i could have played some BROKEN rst racing or wys crap but im so sick of that junk, this deck represents what i like about swccg, without being a pos deck either


my character selection i think is perfect, keeps the destiny high. of course lsjk is a 6 and corran is a 3 so thats only 10 chars with low destiny. home one gets lsjk down cheap, qui is a monster and worth every last one of the 8 force. epp obi does hit and runs.


why weapon lev x2? i LOVE this card, gets your sticks, saves you from mara, or just recycles a 4 as long as you have a used pile (which you can make with any other recycling interrupt)


too close x2? yeahhh buddy, this deck does a little force choke and this can save your guys.


staging areas and OTE? what about fanfare? @#$% fanfare, nobody plays that @#$% card anyway. and you can always do without staging or OTE


everything else is self-explanatory


against


dark deal

you start battle plan, get the falco and @#$% together so you can take over the system if need be. you will be activating force out the wazoo. if it is speed deal they will lose to battle plan and eventually the kiss a wookiees and uncertains will run out.


hunt down racing

you can put ani out but youre not going to win the race, just resign yourself to that fact and get your edges ready to retrieve the damage. start insight of course and dont lose it until you are POSITIVE they arent playing odds, then toss it to get aim high. in fact between that and the signal there is no reason you shouldnt be able to get aim high out before race ends. if they are playing inserts of course keep insight out. after race ends, get qui out to drain/keep hunt down flipped, run lsjk around, use obi for strikes and keep the resilience ready. try also to get your spies on the ex and the falcon at corulag to enforce battle plan. especially against the odds version with only three characters (vader, palpy, and tech mor), if you get a spy to the theater early they cant put palpatine there and they will have to throw vader at corran (barrier). force choke a bit as well.


brangus

is a scrub

go kill him

drain on the death star

win

honestly - you will lose the race again, thats ok, ani is only there so they cant sit and wait to win the race. start dont do that @#$% again and pull your grabber for pasoa, pretty simple stuff.


walker garrison

is your toughest matchup

must enforce battle plan and especially menace fades

direct damage will be a @#$% but between honor and edge retrieval you should outlast, and qui and luke draining will add up, considering they will have NO retrieval


maul’s landing site/jabba’s palace/mkos/or any other platform mains

time for some action like redman

get your guys out and fight

should be a good game and you should win. qui at jabba’s palace with saber and a portal in hand is WRECKER. use honor to negate the drain at the landing site. maul is a @#$% and dies easy. maybe out of commission vader like i did in both my light games at that tourney.



anyway this deck is not broken like the best light decks are but its alright and kinda fun to play too. '
