Sorry...

   ******Put in The Signal instead of a Control, Traffic Control instead of a laser cannon, and Shasa Tiel in for Aquaris******

This deck gets out EBO by the third turn and then drains like mad  I use EBG to get out the pilots and occupy the 3 sites.  Control stops some bad drains, but pick and choose your spot to play them in.  Yarna is key as she provides protection for the x-wings.  The EPP's(ECC's) are suicide mains that are used for breaking up ground forces at their weakest point.	The point of the deck, though, is of course space.  The Cruisers are your flagships while your smaller capitals provide support.  The x-wings hit wherever and whenever they can.  You may be wondering why I have three signals really only five effects?  The reason is, Incom Corporation is cruical to this deck.  Without it you have to mass your x-wings to provide a suitable force. (4 at minimum for the all important battle destiny)  With Incom corp. your x-wings can operate independently.
2 force=2 x-wings, power 11, forfeit 8, and ability "4"  So really for 2 force you'd get power 14 or so, forfeit 8 and 3 attrition.	Pretty good for 1 planet's worth of activation  Organized attack just makes things worse for the opponent, and if Dengar in his toy comes to play, blow him out of space with your laser cannons  This deck can be awesome when it gets working...

...But you have to watch for decree.

Please return comments and suggestions to me, and,  MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU	    '
