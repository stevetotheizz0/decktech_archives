Strategy: '

The object of this deck is to take your time setting up, but then absolutely destroy the opponent with a stack of great destiny and big characters. Start with the regular Step stuff, Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Menace Fades. On your first turn, you should deploy any droid you have and any ship you draw to the <> DBay. After you have your Mess stuff set up, get Tatooine Celebration going and control Tatooine at any means necessary. Your choke ability with this deck is amazing, between limiting them to 1 force at all non-battlegrounds, revolutioning 2/1 locations, and Beggar and Frozen Assets. You generate huge force amounts with Staging Areas and the 7 side of your objective. I think this is better than the beatdown version, because it can be a bit difficult to set up without over-drawing. All the numbers are adjustable, and the effects are all based on local meta, so you may need to change a few of them. I know I dont use many interrupts, but I just dont see the point in needing so much red.


I chose the Gold Squadron 1 over the Millenium Falcon because of the Talon Roll invincibility.


R-3PO is just good math against ISB, and you can get him with Were You Looking For Me?.


IM me at yavinite on aim, because i like to talk about it. anyway, i need admirals orders. 658, and counting.  any CONSTRUCTIVE comments are appreciated.
