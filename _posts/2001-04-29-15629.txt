Strategy: '

Well for starters let me state I really wouldnt post this deck if not for MoffWicket...I just really want to respond to his TR and dont have the rating qualifications to do so yet.
That said...(cmon,have a kind heart n help me out here)...
Heres the scoop with this version of WYS
I will almost ALWAYS have a rebel barrier in hand off opening draw...so...I usually will get Kessel on table with Dash on Rider and a RFC at tat cantina for a 1st turn flip.(not always the case but usually).In the meantime (back at the ranch)
I will be setting up Order to Engage and dropping Anger,Fear,Aggression(AFA) into opponents reserve.
My objective here is to have AFA come up ,rebel barrier anyone they try to deploy for battle,and have them lose 7 force for not battling,4 from AFA and another 3 for Order to Engage.Its fun.
Anyway,this deck has lost only 1 game in tourney play (props to "Stormcrow" for the lesson)and thats over the course of 5 or 6 tourneys now(one of which won me a Japanese foil Darth Vader Case
Topper...-again, props to stormcrow,cause he helped me to get into this tourney even tho I arrived sorta late).
Ok,Set up some early big drains,set up OTE and AFA,and sit back and play Rebel Barrier when they try to stop ya...Then,when they cant battle and lose alot,counterstrike the next turn with bigger forces...your forfeit is big and deploy cost small
so you can afford the sacrificial RFC to cover attrition loss of 5 for ya.Take ADVANTAGE OF THE FLIPPED OBJECTIVE  The extra destiny draw is HUGE,as is the ability to play cards from the lost pile  I have kept opponents from EVER deploying the big ugly Executor by using Frozen Assets and effective Repairs.Hmm...seems I may be a bit buzzed for this...gettin a bit drawn out n @#$%...so here ya go...review it,leave me your constructive crit@#$% and keep in mind I KNOW theres holes in this deck (but havent I disclosed enuff ?)and I also know theres holes in every other damn deck,so hah
