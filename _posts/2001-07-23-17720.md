****************************************

Ok, the Tournament was going fine(me losing every game as expected) till I brought this monster against TJ’s Chyna deck, and bladow, the Dark Lord gets hit by the Pedigree.  So, Gangsta B*tch and Afro Puff hop onto Silver Surfer as passengers and pull a drive by on her loppy a$$.  

And, all but 4 cards(Ben Kenobi, Careful Planning, Ardon ’Vapor’ Crell, and the Foil Dark Lord) were white boardered. 

***************************************

If you want to see the 3P0 Family, look for them on the Ghetto Squad page, pictures of all but Indian Chief are there. '
