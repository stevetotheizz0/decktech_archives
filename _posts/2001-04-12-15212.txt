In Response to a review: I HAVE OMINOUS RUMORS IN HERE BECAUSE I CAN STILL FLIP THE OBJECTIVE!!!!!

Alright. With the recent popularity of THERE IS GOOD IN HIM and the soon to be powerful REBEL STRIKE TEAM, i decided that the best way to fight them would be on their own turf and stop them before they get a chance to set up.  Dont let them set up at all, and THIS is how:

First off, ust POWER OF THE HUTT to pull ephant mon and drop him at the bunker.  Use YOU CANNOT HIDE FOREVER to pull PERIMETER PATROL and drop it there.  With EPHANT MON there, their spies cannot deploy.  Try to get the BACK DOOR out and control it. Look for CLOSED DOOR and drop it there. With these out, they cannot move to the bunker, they cannot deploy to the bunker, and if they dont deploy to the REBEL LANDING SITE, they cannot move, or battle and they must lose a force.

I use EPHANT MON, HEWEX, FENSON, and DYER to guard the bunker, thats more than enough. If they do get in, Dyer is a power 3, ability 3, so hes pretty good.  Also , HEWEX allows imperials to deploy to the bunker as a react, so hold someone in your hand (like VADER) and save a few force.

I know that INSERTION PLANNING could send my biker scouts to my udes pile, but thats OK, cuz its unique and cannot be used again for battle.

Use DARTH VADER: DLOTS to choke the rebel scouts, most of them have low ability anyways.  Use the TRAMPLES to kill them with TEMPEST 1 and the TEMPEST SCOUTS.  

I am considering adding in EMPIRES NEW ORDER to retreive force when battling ewoks, which is likely.  WHATS everyones opinion???

I know i should take advantage of Ominous Rumors, but if theyre playing TIGIH, im screwed from the beginning cuz LUKE controls an ENDOR site.

VS. REBEL STRIKE TEAM - this is what the deck is mainly designed to fight.  Get EPHANT MON to the BUNKER and try to get out the BACK DOOR and CLOSED DOOR. If you can hold the LANDING PLATFORM and the BACK DOOR, they cant move in or deploy to the bunker.  Get all of your ships to ENDOR ASAP to kill them. (They will most likely have TALA 1 and TALA 2 with CLOSE AIR SUPPORT)  If you can hold ENDOR (there are enough ships) then you can heavily drain and they get no C.A.S. Set up like this: CHOKE, TRAMPLE, AND DRAIN and the game is YOURS!!!!!

VS. THERE IS GOOD IN HIM - this is basically the same as before, only try to capture LUKE and hold him.  DONTT BATTLE UNLESS YOU KNOW YOU CAN WIN. I FEEL THE CONFLICT will stack up very quickly, and that is BAD!  

This deck has all the tools to beat these two and they are and will be VERY popular, so get the AT-STs and start stompin!
