description: This decks focuses on draining in space and controlling the ground drains with undercovered probe droids. Hidden Base is quite popular in my area, and this deck does quite well against it. You might say I built it just for it.

Strategy: 

I brought this deck to a tourney I won last weekend. I wanted to bust out a different style of DS space and I'd never seen Rendili played before...so I thought..what the heck.

Two big strategies in my area are Hidden Base and the super falcon. Who doesn't face those decks? Anyway, this deck deals with both nicely. I can fight a HB deck with the multitude of Big Blue I have at my disposal. Getting some retrieval with probing probe droids is a nice bonus as well. The cannons are for those ships that cause me problems and of course, the super falcon. There is nothing like shooting down the super falcon against an opponent who's not expecting it.

The biggest problem I have is against Profit. I can blanket their drains, but I can't stop the force loss due to their mains. I just have to spread a bit thin and drain at my key systems, adding presenseOTF where needed.

This deck should handle a M&T deck. Play Oh switch off to cancel their SATM's. If you do run up against R3P0, run away! I did have a restraining bolt in here, but took it out recently. I might decide to put it back in in place of SHUOSHD.

Against Ops...just blanket their sites with Undercover spies.

Yavin Throne Jump. If they play revo -- you have to keep drawing for your systems, but with 10 systems..your bound to get enough force going. And if he does revo, you have some fat drains available to you.

This is another deck that's not "top" notch, but fun to play. Don't expect to crush people with this, but it should hold up on it's own.

Hope you like it.

Someone pointed out to me that Homing Beacon won't work with this deck. I had it in there originally when I used more characters (specifically leaders). So I need to swap that card out for another Anti Landing claw. Probably Those rebels won't escape us OR I'd just as soon kiss a wookie.
