Strategy: '

Sweet Profit deck that has gone 6-0 in my last 2 tourneys. Has a good selection of characters which can definitely provide a beatdown.

I like to start Goo Nee Tay, but if it isn't going to do any good keep it in your deck. You can start Draw Their Fire or Wise Advice as well. Use the Landing Claws to stop space drains. Deploy and rescue Han and then drain and make them lose to the OBJ. Has done very well for me so far.

Here is how I like to play this deck against most of the DS deck types dominant today

HDADTJ with or with dueling Use the spies to stop Visage. I will almost always have a Ben/Luke on the table so we both will be losing to Visage. Use Glancing Blow/Courage Of A Skywalker along with Ben Kenobi's text to stop dueling.

ROPS This has always been a hard deck to play again, but this deck can definitely beat it if you play smart and pay attention.

ISB These don't seem popular anymore, but just beat them down and they will slowly run out of characters.

OPS Order To Engage/Narrow Escape. All that nifty stuff. You know how it goes.

Well, there you have it. Please review and give me any comments/suggestions. Thanks  '
