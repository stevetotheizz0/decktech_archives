Strategy: '

Against any deck that you're sure has SAC or annoying interrupts (i.e. Hyper Escape, Narrow Escape, sabacc), start Oppressive Enforcement.
Otherwise, start Bad Feeling Have I.

The deck is fairly simple to play. Flip when you feel the need to do so, and play the rest intelligently. Don't drop Vader to help flip the objective, since there is no Fury protection.

Against XWings, be wary of Eject, Eject and XWing Laser Cannons. Try not to deploy a ship until HB is flipped. Use Search and Destroy and the steady drain of 3 or so to force the flip.

Against Ops, start dropping stuff on their planet, and flip mid-game. Use your activation advantage to its fullest.

Anyway, message me any questions you have...
