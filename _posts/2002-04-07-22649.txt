Strategy: 

Pretty basic Dark Deal.  I like the TIES/cannons so I use those instead of Admirals/Imperial Commands, and I don’t start Mob. POints b/c too many people pack Don’t Do That Again.  This deck can drain for tons, and even beat down if necessary.

This deck will set up fast if you play it right, and there are plenty o’ support cards to help you battle/increase drains, etc.

I have been very successful with this deck, and I like the Virtual Black 2 cuz it hurts HB, which can hurt you.

thanks!
