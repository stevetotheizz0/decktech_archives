Strategy: 

Starting stuff:
Hoth: Ice Plains, Prepared Defenses for Imperial Arrest Order, Imperial Decree, and Mobilization Points

Object of deck:
To start the deck off on the right foot, you need to pull Hoth: Echo Docking Bay first turn and drop someone there.  Next turn, you’ll have decent activation.  In the meantime, use Imperial Command to pull Admiral Piett.  Use Piett’s gametext to pull Commander Merrejk.  Once deployed somewhere with a Scomp link, use Merrejk’s gametext to pull Hoth.
This is a double-occupation style deck, and is exceptionally fun to play.  The goal is to get both Presence Of The Forces down to 2 non-battleground Hoth sites, then occupy them with generals or commanders with both Rebel Base Occupation and We’re In Attack Position Now on table.  The combination of this, and Overseeing It Personally on Emperor Palpatine, you can feasibly bring your opponent to their knees with direct damage.
If playing against an Echo Base Ops deck, there is the added bonus of using Target The Main Generator to blow the Main Generators, and hence easily cancel EBO; it may not be efficient, but have you ever seen a successful TTMG cripple your opponent?  Imperial Command gives you the ability to pull the generals and admirals you’ll need both on Hoth and at Hoth holding the system, plus helps in battles.  The deck is heavy with characters so that you should be adequately be able to hold all of Hoth.
This deck has no retrieval engine.  It is designed to work fast and punish your opponent fiercely.
