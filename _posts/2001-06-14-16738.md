Strategy: '

This Deck is very simple to play.


The big upside is that if you’re really beating the crap out of the other guy you can do it by more by retrieving up to 20 force


The charecters are exceptionally good. Qui-Gon and Luke get the job done.


Start- Control the Chamber and don’t let anyone in or it could cost the game. Getting out Bacta tank and Wise&Do Or Don’t can win the game by tanking all you’re characters and redploying them.

Make you’re jedi look defenseless the play Armed&D.Start the podrace on turn 2 if possible the make sure you play losing track to damage their pod.


Locations- The locations in this deck are only for draining after Han is out.


Effects-Goo Nee Tay stops the vader and tarkin drop. Projection stops a drain where they are hiding from you. The ultimate Jar Jar reincarnator just drop him and a few others, use his text and get rid of that ever annoying dengar wgun, then bring him back with  munchen. Bacta Tank the ultimate Han Saver, plus it lets the jedi’s and talz come back. Don’t forget to grab their interrups. And stop the Alter, Sense Crap.


Interrupts- Use the Chimes to get the Talz’s out. Focus to lower their power. And the almighty levitation- get a weapon,grab theirs, stop you are beaten plus a recycable 4, this card is the best still. Blaster deflection to let you’re jedi’s stay alive a little longer and annoy your opponent. If you’re going to battle a stacker make sure you clash their best person. Houjix is a backup just in case you have 7 or more battle damage. Arm you’re jedi a WArmed & Dangerous. Use the Signal to get first off you’re bacta tank the the sense and alter killer.


Characters- The characters are overwhelminging and they never seem to leave. Set a few people at a site then wait for a drop and move over Obi- Wan and gut them. Qui-Gon and Luke seem to live forever because of their immunity to attrition. Set you’re talz around Han and With a Qui-Gon or Obi. Lando adds destiny.Padme get out you’re Jedi’s. H’nemthe sits with Han so vader is deploy +4 with Goo Nee Tay on table and JarJar never leaves and can drop at a non-battleground.


 Well that sums up my deck. The best part of this deck is it’s retrieval and it’s power.


I’m always open to Suggestions and if I see somehting that will kill others I will update my deck as soon as I get the message. Have fun

 Late, Darryll”217”Silva
