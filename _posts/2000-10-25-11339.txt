      Wise Advice
      Star Destroyer

-Note... I took Honor out, because I feel that you dont need it.  9 out of 10 times you can get a spy by 2nd to 3rd turn to cancel visage, then go undercover.	All it did was numb search and destroy, but if they have S&D in their deck, then theyre gonna occupy another battleground.  Battle Order and S&D arent in effect half the time, because obi and the other scrubs in this deck can somewhat hold their own at the north ridge.  To prevent from getting dueled... dont lay your mains by vader.	If they drop vader on your mains, on the edge them...
****************READ THE STRATEGY****************

This deck is better then is looks.  First thing you do is track down ANSB.  If you dont have it in your hand, and dont have a Signal, then activate, and look at your reserve deck to see if theres one in your force pile.
After ANSB is out, throw Crix down to an Echo site, pull out Beezer, and throw her down to an Echo site, and pull out Electrobinocs.  Now not only can you somewhat stack your deck, but you have 2 of your 3 echo sites covered for EBO.  Yes, I am good enough to track cards in my reserve deck, however this deck doesnt draw much destiny, so having Electros out is well worth it.  Youll mainly use them if you need to get rid of an opponents character under the shield, or to get a good destiny for On The Edge.
This deck keeps the opponents drains and damage down to a minimum.  Cycling On The Edges is a bonus, but you dont need to do it to win.  If they get grabbed, no big deal.  This deck can win without them, but its a tighter game.  When you feel confident in space, throw down your ships (with haven preferably) to either sullust or Yavin.  This deck utilizes these systems, because the Executor cant jump between them, and you can lay Haven to either of them.  This deck has amazing power, and great drain potential.
