Strategy: 

This is the original Hunt Down Flagship Ops deck.	Accept no imitations.  Heres how it works:
On your first turn, get out Executors Docking Bay.  Use Mobilization Points to pull the Executor.  Thats 3 sites already, only on your first turn.  When you get a signal, search for Flagship Ops.  If you have Commander Gherant, Admiral Piett, or Imperial Command, go down the line to search for Gherant: command for piett, piett for gherant.  Use Gherant to search for Executor sites for a quick Ops.  Use Darth Vader at the Meditation Chamber for under-ability systems.	Put high-ability pilots in low-ability Star Destroyers.  Vaders and Jades Lightsabers are used for force draining.  If anybody has any ideas of how to get rid of Visage, let me know.	Heres some card strategies:
-Use Piett for his ability to pull commanders and AOs.	Put him on Executors Control Station
-Use Ozzel to lower ships deploy costs
-Use Chiraneau to boost drains
-Put Igar in Tempest 1 for serious ground control
-Use Brandei to pull Interceptors
-Use Merrejk to pull systems
-Put Soontir Fel on a Dreadnaught full of TIEs and watch the fun begin
-Grand Moff Tarkin is for piloting and Kessel
-Imperial Command is perfect for this deck
-You can use the AO to pull your AT-ATs

vs.Throne Room Mains:  Set up FLOPS, drain them out.

vs. EBO:  Good matchup.  Battle them and drain them to death

vs. Hidden Base:  Shouldnt be too hard to probe

vs. Ops:  Kill them for fun and drain

vs. Odds:  odds is now dead, which is why no protection is needed

vs. Profit:  Drain

vs. TIGIH: Dont let Luke get near any imperials.

vs. anything else: Drain and battle

Thanks for reading.  If anyone has any suggestions, you know what to do.  Tell me what I need and dont need.  They dont allow more than 60 cards in a deck.
