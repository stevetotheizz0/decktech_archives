Strategy: '

Just your typical ISB deck with Scum and Villany thrown in. I start with Coruscant and an effect depending on what the opponent is playing. I drain on tatooine mostly. I play with the Independant Starships for Hidden base and for Battle plan. Jabba's Through With You to draw destiny with my bounty hunters with built in weapons. The Relentless Tracking is for Undercover spies and Arconas which is prevalent in my area. The overall strategy is to drain with the bonus and then battle and retrieve 3 and make the opponent lose one for eat battle. Thats about it '
