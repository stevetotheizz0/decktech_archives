Strategy: '

STRATEGY

The strategy is easy. Well for start you get Carida with Mobibization Point, then u search for DSII- DB and the Emperor, i usually deploy the emperor at the DSII-DB for more force generation. Then i’ll pretty much wait for the opponent to initiat something, and then i start deploying guys.  Remember you must win battle in order to turn luke, so keep your offensive back, and release it when the moment is right.

Profit

Put Mara and Dannik at the audience chamber, search for her stick if not there move them to jabba palace,and start draining. Jabba Palace is a better place to stand cause u can use your walkers there, and plus if he doesn’t have guys there you can drain.

Degobah

Against Degobah i usually start with resistence cause most of the times they play with anger fear aggression. The Strategy is easy, just drain for alot.

Hidden Base

Start Draining as much as u can untill he flips, after that deploy your ships and probe, and fight him in space.

EBO

Enforce the ground with your characters, and try to cancel EBO, but is not going to be a quick thing is gonna take time.  Play resistence to make lower your opponents force drains, and fight in space only if u know u are going ot win. '
