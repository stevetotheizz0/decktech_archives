Strategy: '

The main changes to the deck is that I changed to
JP Han so that you can take your time free-ing Han
and retrieve a nice amount of force when you do it.
Included some destiny adders for firepower and to
make sure that the Lightsabers get into Luke and
Ben's Han's really quickly. I also increased the
destiny of the deck... the other one had streaky
destiny, you'd either have a bunch of 6s or 0s.
I'm contemplating what to do about Space but hope
the Direct Occupation Damage is enough.

v. HDADTJ-( 2 Spies , 3 Dueling things )- shouldn't
be much of a problem unless they duel blind.

v. Ops - Beggar in combonation with Order to Engage
and DTF is pretty nasty versus Ops , as well as
making them fight on your turf.

v. Court - you converted their stuff , look at their
aliens before choosing your Starting Effect.
Beatdown can happen very quickly for you here.

v. Anything else- Beatdown , retrieve , Profit
Damage = simple

Cards I want to add in  I Hope She's Alright (LS
Search and Destroy ) to help hurt TIEs , Endor Ops,
and possibly Big Blue. Also I'd like some suggestions
what to do with space...maybe even drop it totally. '
