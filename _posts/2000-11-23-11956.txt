Strategy: 

Yes, I do need reviews. This a pretty basic, but solid BHBM deck.
It can hold it’s ground against most
anything. Get Rendilli before you even get your hand, or executor. It all depends on if they are giving you force or not. Basically sense or alter what you
can. Play circle
on ben, then kill off whatever else with your
sabers and dr. evason, with help of cards like imperial barrier and you are beaten. Play lateral Damage
on thier mon calamaries and kill off with
executor. Then use Dr. Evason and vader or boba or whoever has a weapon, put
disarmed on someone good, like lea or han and operate before a battle even
happens then play circle, HA HA mains die, you crush them in battle. Captain Sarkli is in there because in my area, some people still play liberation.
AGAINST PROFIT:
Either start Boba and Jabba, or Jabba and
evason. Then get everyone to jabba’s
Palace. Be shure to sense SOWLY, so
they can?t be cheap. Get out secret plans to
stop retriving by opponent. Sniper or disarm han, you win by battling, stacking cards then dueling.
Against EBO:
Start Imperial Decree, secret plans. Invade hoth. Make shure you CONTROL 2 echo sites so decree will work to stop force drain bonuses. Then drain on hoth and kill of baraguins or whatever they have there, watch out for icestorm. Against the new deck with DB retreival, send in Ig-88 and 4-lom. Sniper off the retrival guy, then kill off whoever is left. Disarm obi if you have to, then battle him. He is usless without his saber.

ANYTHING ELSE:
React to what opoonent does. If the play Hidden Base, get out security precatuins, probe and battle. Probing will keep you from taking battle damage because of security precations.

PLEASE REVIEW!
Thanks!
