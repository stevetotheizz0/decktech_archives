Strategy: 

I start S&V because I have 2 copies of All Wrapped Up (otherwise, I'd start with that)

Hidden Weapons: a way of capturing/killing characters
Elis Helrot: if your opponent is on another planet.
Twi'lek Advisor: Get out those effects faster
Trap Door: Utilitize the Rancor
Ghhhk: in case if you're ever super-outpowered
There'll Be Hell To Pay: catch any annoying interrupts
Bad Feeling Have I: makes it harder for them to get a beatdown crew
First Strike: use with S&V-another retrieval engine
Quick Reflexes: you can lose hidden weapons and dengar's riot gun and still kick butt
Death Mark: Anti-Profit
Expand the Empire: old-skool alien deployment(w/audience chamber)
All Wrapped Up: A must for this deck
Resistence: I hate inserts
Dengar's Modified Riot Gun: use with Jodo Kast. Come here Yoda :)
Skiff: to protect your characters from the Sarlacc
Bubo: keep people where you need them, eat spies
ZiMH: you only have 6 ability? what a pity
Bossk In Bus: one extra destiny
Iggy in Ship:  Keep him alone at a system.  they can't fight you but you can fight them.
Bossk w/ Gun: capture time
Lyn Me: helpful w/ bounty hunters
Mosep/ Galid: force drain bounuses
M'iiyoom: scan opponent's hand for rebels
Ephant: keep spies out of the audience chamber
Pote: helps w/ skiffs

vs. Profit: start Mara and Jodo.  if you have either weapon in hand, get out the other one w/ Jodo's game text. if not, pick one.  Put the capture gun on Jodo and the Lightsaber on Mara.  Use Death Mark, and  just kick their butt.
vs. Hidden Base: probe w/ the ships.
vs. MWYHL:use the ships to go to Dagobah and kick butt.
vs. Yavin 4 choke: just stay on planet, let them come to you.

That's all the types I've seen at tourneys around here, I think.
If you tell me what to put in, tell me what to take out in its place
Thanx,
