----
Mains: duel when you have tracked. protect visage with holonets. if they come out somewhere else ig88 can take out a few characters. mara and dr e can help too. the deck is self explanitory!


Ops: Start Battle Order. Get Vader out ASAP. Get the Holotable out for activation and a drain before they flip. Beat down on ships in the late game. Use other characters to fight and Vader to duel if you can.

HB: get out Vader ASAP. Get Mara to the CC DB and get Search and Destroy goin.

Profit: Just like Mains but start with Dr E and Mara.

That is how it works. Always start IAO, except against ops.

-----------------In response to reviews:--------------------

- I do play Put all sections on alert

- I only own one DLOTS or I would run 2

- I think 3 ships is enough

- I dont own any more visages, and holonet has other uses too...
