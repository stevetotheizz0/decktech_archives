Strategy: '

OK IT’S NOT @$$
Reasons behind card specifics
Disarmed IS the best, removes weapon and reduces power
Order to Engage is key to get opponent to have doors drop on them
Ounee Ta for rops and spaceportdocking bays
HonorI know that No Escape stops it, but a lot of decks I’ve seen aren’t playing it
Aim Highpower bonus, lots of dark alien decks using retreval
The Force Is Strong With This OneLOTS of high ability imps
NOOOOOOOHunt Down and BHBM
How Did We Get Into This Mess?circulating to find chars helps sooo much.

Matchups
VS Huntdownuse someone who loves you to get Han, try to play your own game of dropping doors

Vs Tiescan be rough, in non-unique alter the Dreaded Imperial Starfleet keep circulating to get chars out fast and outdrain

VS BHBMGIVE THEM LUKE, find NOOOO and go man go

VS ROPSfind Ounee Ta and kick him again and again

VS Courtstart Aim High, look for Someone Who Loves You, and keep doors handy

Thnx 4 reviewing me deck, and ALL suggestiong are welcome.
Happy Holidays all '
