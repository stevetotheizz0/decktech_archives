Strategy: '

Opps forgot a card make that 2 ommni box&its worse


Some cards that you can take out that aint vital to the deck are...join me,vaders anger,weapon of an unnhfgh(although it is pretty good)...i just haven’t found anythin else worth putin in for them.


Now for strategdythis deck basically has a drain war vs ebo in which you win cause you have resistance and drains of like 5648...


vs profit i start mara and aurra cause i like girls and ryming...no cause they are good especially with 2 weapon levs.then get vader and maul with their sticks asap with guys...empy is nice but i never get the combo of janus and empy...yet at least.battle and get i have you now...they battle you with luke and you kick their @$$


why certain cards...join me...i have only gotten it to work once but man does it make a difference...luke over to me or in the used pile ...vaders anger...its a nice trackable five that adds one to your swing which saved my @#$% a time or 2.weapon of an undygdsgs it gets rid of there stick which is nice...why bosskw/gun you ask...cause the destinies are either really high like 6...or really low like 1...hmmm anybody i know that has a destiny of 6 or 1...i could name a few so you send them to used pile...that is better than havein to fight them right?


vs.HB Mains i get my guys out that can put up a fight and battle doin as much damge as possible..i duno what else to say except battle and drain.
