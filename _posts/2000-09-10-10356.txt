Strategy: 

The Strategy is pretty much the same as the
original Burn Him Before Me. It gives you a
good chance against everything. I changed
some of the Effects and Interrupts because
I use to have to many cards on the table and
I'd be running on the same 30 card to win
the game. The destiny in this deck is pretty
high so Vader is a machine like normal.
I love the Projections , good to keep AFA
off your back for awhile. Lost in the
Wilderness will suck but hopefully you can
Always Thinking thier Luke and make them
lose 3 force a turn to your objective.
Don't forget to make them stack cards when you
win battles. Oh yeah , I decided once again
that Mara Jade is junk if you don't use SAC ,
Goo Nee Tay makes her really suck and she
can't really hold a site.
