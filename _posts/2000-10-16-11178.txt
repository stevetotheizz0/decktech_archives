Strategy: 

Here is some card-to-card Strategy:

Objective(1):
Endor Operations/ Imperial Outpost ( a good objective I which flipping is not crucial)

Characters(15):
Boba Fett With Blaster Rifle (+1 blaster shot and destiny with Han)
Mara Jade, The Emperor’s Hand (power 4, ability 5, gets to search for a weapon also a spy and lots of scout cards also go with spies)
 Commander Igar (good with Veers and on Tempest Walkers {preferably Tempest 1})
 General Veers (good with Igar and on Combat vehicles)
Colonel Davod Jon (super powerful scout)
Segeant Elsek (scout that satisfies all battle damage and attrition when with another biker scout)
Ephant Mon (no spies man {or alien})
Darth Vader With Lightsaber (suicidal freak)
Biker Scout Trooper x6 (main part of this deck)

Sites (8):
Sullust (2:2)
Fondor (Executor’s base)
Forest (immunity)
Endor: Back Door (2:2)
Endor: Great Forest (no more non-scouts traveling for you or opponent)
Endor: Landing Platform
Endor: Bunker
Endor

Blue Cards (15):
Devastator (A: 2, P: 9, D: 8, F: 9)
Chimaera (A: 2,P: 8, D: 9, F: 10 and immunity)
Executor (A: 3,P: 12, D: 15, F: 15  and immunity)
Bossk in Hound’s Tooth (extra destiny)
Zuckuss in Mist Hunter (A: 4 and oppent destiny = 0 if they don’t have ability 6)

Speeder Bike x7 (for the scouts)
Tempest 1 (big good walker)
Tempest scout 3
Tempest scout 6

Interrupts(11):
Prepared Defenses(starting)
Accelerate x2(destiny 6)
Sneak Attack x3(adds to attrition of dark)
Scout Recon x2(destiny 6)
High-Speed Tactics x3 ( adds 1 destiny)

Effects(8):
You Cannot Hide Forever(searches for effect)
Mobilization Points( activation +2 and you can take Executor)
Imperial Arrest Order( imps ability less than 3 are forfeit +2)
Ominous Rumors( drain +2 at systems; also needed for the objective)
Royal Escort( scouts are forfeit +1)
Presence Of The Force(+1 light, 1 dark)
Bad Feeling Have I( light mains deploy +2)
Establish Secret Base( force drain +1 at Endor for each site controlled by biker scout)

Green Cards(2):
Scout Blaster ( good with scouts)


I start with prepared defenses, imp. Arrest order, You cannot hide forever, mobilization points and … oh yeah… the objective.

 The strategy is really easy and basic. You get scouts out, control sites, get the two needed effects out, then force drain the enemy to death. What fun!

Cards to watch out for:
Blout and Cracken in their ship cause they hurt scout and spy decks
RST if the deck is based on heavy forces built for killing

Also my two new cards, Aratech co. and relentless traking can be used to hunt down the enemys who come t the ground.

Cards I want to add, but I don’t have: walkers, Lord Vader, and Emperor Palpitine and perimiter patrol..

That’s about it.
