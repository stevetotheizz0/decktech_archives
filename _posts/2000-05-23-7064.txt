This is a Mains & Toys for Dark which does good against most decks since it is a powerhouse that focuses on battling. START Tatooine Jabba's Palace and the effect that best suits the deck you are up against. For this deck I had to decide if I wanted to play Tatooine Occupation or free up all my characters for battling. As you can see I chose the latter and with all the deadly combos in this deck (most all of the characters play off each other) it can really kick butt. I have considered cards like First Strike, Beolo, Bad Feeling Have I, & Tatooine Occupation, but just didn't have room (LMK what you think). Before I get to the deck strategies I will explain the cards and combos of this deck that make it such a killer in battles.

Dr.Evazan: Use this bad boy to knock off those pesky mains with disarmed and his nice way of killing those injured mains. When facing a blind draw with a lighsaber with the Doc at the same site use Dark Strike to ensure the hit and "operation." This strategy can be a big killer and I have used it in many battles to wipe those mains out.

The Circle Is Now Complete: Ya baby, Darth all the way over Obi. Use this to non-epic duel Obi out of the game. As long as you both have no sabers or you have a lightsaber you will win since there is no destiny draw. Then Obi is placed out of play which HURTS BAD. When dueling Ben Kenobi use 4-LOM to wipe his game text so you'll win. This is a NASTY card and, when used at the right time, can be a game winner.

SNIPER: Use this card to knock of spies or create havoc by killing a critical main during your control phase (ouch), then beating on the rest in a battle.
You Are Beaten: This card is in for two reasons the first to cancel Uncontrollable Furry. The second reason is the same as Sniper, create havoc by knocking a critical main (like Ben) and then beating on the rest.
Sense & Alter: These cards can be very painful for your opponent if played at the right time. Even though the Wise Advice/Do, Or Do No combo makes it seam like sense and alter are just a waste of space they are DEADLY when played at the right time.

7 Locations: I only have four sites that I can drain at b/c this is not a big draining deck, it mostly focuses on killing the lightside by battles. Also once you get the two Jabba’s Palace sites out you only have 5 destiny 0’s left in your reserve deck. The three non Tatooine/Endor sites are for force activation. All the force you get every turn is very important since it allows you to get the cards you need and have enough force for a beatdown.

Now for the deck strategies:

Against Hidden Base:
Since hidden base #'s has been getting very popular I would always start Resistance (so it's not lost in a first turn insert). If it tuns out that the deck is not #'s then get out Security Precautions and probe when they flip. If your are playing an OMDH deck with Super Falcon/Mant.Savip then get out Secret Plans/CHYBC and then wait for them to move. When they deploy their mains knock them off with yours (Not hard at all). Without their main they are TOAST. Any HB deck that's not #'s shouldn't be hard.

Against MWYHL: Start Secret Plans and start draining with a few charectors.  Then just wait for them to do something and pound them when they deploy. If you feel like it load up a BH ship and go say hi to Yoda. Shouldn't be hard to win.

Against Speeder OPS: Start Battle Order and then pay them a visit on their planet. With your mains you can beat on them which will result in the win. Make sure to alter Maneuvering Flaps. Should be able to win since they will have to focus on battling and won't be able to drain.

Against Yavin 4 Revolver: Star Crush and be glad they can't revolve you Jabba's Palace sites (and Death Star). Evader/Alter their Revolutions. If this is a popular deck in your area add in another Evader.

Against Yavin 4 Mains: Start Crush the Rebellion to protect against Clash of Sabers (also just incase they had Revolvers). As a mentioned,Bad feeling would be nice but I don't have much room. I've tried these kind of decks and my mains can beat theirs.


Thanks for rating and have a great day.
