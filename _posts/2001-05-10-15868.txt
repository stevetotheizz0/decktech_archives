Strategy: 

First off I want to reiterate that this is a FUN deck that actually works when you catch your opponent off guard you can be quite devastating... Just try it out.

-DISCLAIMER- I didn’t use any objective because I made this DECK long before the Objective came out so it’s the way it was when I originally made it. :) Thanks.


As for some of the cards that are in the deck:

Yaggle Gakkle (after you finish laughing) you can use this card against the Banthas so that Bubo can get buff... permanately... then you can go around kiling Jedi like there is no tomorrow. I know cause I have killed Obi-Wan, Luke Skywalker, Chewie W/Blaster and Han W/Blaster w/a 12 Power Bubo. :) Dont laugh at the sheer power. Plus its a 6 Desinty that you can recycle
Crossfire - to make my opponent pay for his retrieval, plus the power bonus of 5 is nice.
Imperial Arrest Order - I dont like my opponenet sitting somewhere building up then dropping over in the control phase to beat down someone. So thats my anti-Nabrum Leids card. I am thinking of taking this out tho for Reactor Terminal.
Disruptor Pistols - Well alot of guys are unique and hit =s lost so ..... you do the math and with the destiny in the deck its a beast.

Granted my forfit isnt all that but then I dont usually lose by alot and if I do I can rig my destiny to get less than a 3 and retrieve a little. The Abyssins are in there to get the 12 non-unique people not for the retrieval. I am considering putting in the combo card instead because I can make use of it. :)

Other than that theres not much to say just leave a Weequay Guard with another Weequay and in the others on Skiffs and react when needed. (Weequay Guard w/another Weequay (non guard) add a destiny)

Enjoy
