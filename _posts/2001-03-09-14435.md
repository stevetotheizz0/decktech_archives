update 

since everyone hates 3 worrts so much (sure ya do) ditch one for another jedi luke. 2 should be enough worrts, and another destiny 6 never hurts


also, since i know someon will bring it up, just use geezum as your rep, since he is a snivvian. 

-------


Ok, this deck is a choker on MKOS, which has been pretty popular lately. It limits their force, and keeps their options limited in the beginning. It also works well as a mains/harvest platform vs other decks, since not everyone plays MKOS.


Just play it like a mains deck, and it’ll work, trust me.


Cards


Skiff -- why do i play this jank card? lets see. i know, its because now my characters dont get stuck at the desert heart, darn i hate that site why not a racing skiff. well, i like the extra power of this one, and the higher capacity.


Worrt -- hes a mean tech trick right here. you stick him, rennek (not necessary, but he helps), at the AC, when they have a guy there, and you use bo shuda and order to engage. this totally screws them. they basically lose 3 force every turn for the rest of the game, unless they play point man, in which case they will lose for one less turn, because you will harvest to get it back, then signal for it. its golden. this works vs all decks, but works the best against CCT, MKOS and Court since they usually need to control that site, but little do they know that they are screwed.


Slight Weapons Malfunction -- destiny adder with the EPPS


Jedi Prescence -- gives that little extra power to swing the battle into your favor vs mkos swarm and fortress versions


fallen portal -- as twigg put it best, no LS deck is complete without one


choke -- is ephant mon giving you the blues? is mighty jabba adding too many destinys for you to handle? is bib just being gay? fix them all


Barrier -- no brainer, it also prevents beat and runs at the AC, so you can make sure to pull off the worrt/OTE combo


I Know + EPP Han + EPP Leia + Chewie Protector = five destinys of madness and some insane power. throw in jedi luke and a jedi prescence, and its all good


The Signal -- all your effects are good to get out early, and it makes sure you have OTE when you need it.


Its A Trap -- prevents beatdowns on owen and beru, as well as cancel sniper/dark strike


Weapon Lev -- oh so good. it steals snoovas axe and cancels YAB, and its easily recyclable, NICE


harvest -- its a drug that im addicted to


Affect Mind -- mega tech right here folks. everyone stocks a site with 4-5 ability, right? well, they just got screwed. you drop ben or luke with this, and battle, you get destiny, they dont. beatdowns are even more efficent now


Ounee Ta -- rops is a headache no more (take that chu)


Honor -- its still good


I Hope She’s Alright -- makes them come to you against non-mkos decks


uh-oh -- makes bo shuda that much better


ben -- hes a doctor who saves owen and beru countless times


lando -- hes good. real good


geezum -- gets out the other sites, like lars MF and the chamber/JP (whichever you didnt start)


Rennek -- keeps worrt from killing and being killed, and makes the whole OTE thing flawless


corran -- undercover spies are such a pain


home one dbay -- makes MKOS harder to flip


DoDN/WA -- free grabbers, espically handy for those first turn twi’leks and imperial commands


now for some matchups


MKOS -- PUH-LEASE. this deck is built to beat it. the choke, plus the AC tech is just mean, and most MKOS’s have no chance in hell of winning


Court/CCT -- control the AC, and you win. OTE is a charm in these decks. use the EPPS to beatdown on them for lots of damage


ISB -- tough, but it can be beaten, espically if they cant handle the harvests. ISB scum sucks vs this deck, since they get nailed in the AC


Hunt Down -- just relax, take visage, and harvest it back. try to cancel visage, but its ok if you dont. luke and ben are good to duel with, but set up your destiny first or you are done. tought matchup


BHBM -- give them jedi luke, and say good day sir. the tie vs sucks against i hope shes alright. EPPs win battles, and its a trap cancels those that you cant win


other stuff -- play by ear, and try to lure them to the AC, then drop bo shuda, OTE and worrt, then they are screwed.


ok, any questions, d-mail me. its a good deck, and it eats up scum for breakfast.
