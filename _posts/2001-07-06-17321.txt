Stupid deck, but it works most of the time.

Start with Watto’s Box, unless opponent starts with Podrace Prep, then start Imperial Arrest Order.

Get Palpatine to the Throne Room, with Emperor’s Power. Get your Effects Out: Imperial Arrest Order and Reactor Terminal are the most important.

If you get Tech, deploy him and insert if possible.

Use Masterful Move to get the holotable on table.

Drop Vader to a battleground and get Luke. Move Vader with Luke to Emperor and duel with Sith Fury. If you win he loses 9 force. Combined with Podrace and inserts he’s got a lot of direct damage.

You could add some space (Zuckuss and/or Bossk), but they are destiny 1 (you need those high destinies) and barrier and beatdown is painful
