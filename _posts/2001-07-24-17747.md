Strategy: '

Let’s see here...


First Turn Start the race. Deploy the training area and draw a test (1 unless you already have it). Pull and deploy everything you can to Dagobah except sites, only deploy the jungle if you have it.


Second Turn Race. Test if possible, you should pass easily. Deploy Yoda’s hut and the new test to Jungle. If opponent doesn’t move it you’re gold, even if he doesn’t he saves you a force by moving it to you. 


Third Turn Race should finish soon. Test and unless he moved the second test to you deploy third test to finish testing (in this scenario do both tests before racing to reduce his race destiny by 1), if he moved deploy the Test to the jungle; move to it your done.


Fourth Turn The Race should be over by now so if you won deploy I Did It and scrap Boonta Eve. Retrieve your Force. Move yoda and leia to the hut. If you played smart and didn’t have terrible luck you should be in good shape. Hold a planet and a site and you should be in control.


Fifth Turn No racing, no testing, it’s time to brawl and you got alot in your favor.


Notes 


Testing shouldn’t be a problem at all. You only need a two and a two tracked.


Racing is harder since you might be slowed by having to put test stuff back in your used pile, but with any luck you’ll be okay.


Use cards as you draw them don’t rush yourself against a speed deck.


Not much dueling protection so stay alert and don’t get caught unprepared. 


Responses


Secret Plans Retrieval is on the control phase I should have plenty of force.


Force Generation 4 than 8 than 10 and than 11 with podracer bay 12 with Qui-gon’s bonus 14 with Tatooine out. 


I admit I’m not fully dueling but with test three and what was that out. I might hold on. 


Test 3 is too major to not do. You complete for free on the same turn as two and it reduces all destinies not just battle. That one off each weapon fire, Card Tech draw, dueling draw, and even podrace draw. With Yoda at the hutt and this the dark side needs a four or higher to even kill a scrub with no or low immunity.
