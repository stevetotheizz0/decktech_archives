Strategy: '

General Comments  Im surprised that with the popularity of Watch Your Step that more people arent using CCT just to get Captain Han out of the way. Then you can use I Had No Choice on Dash and against most decks that would be enough to beat them out of space ; add in a Look Sir Droids or something to screw R2 and 3PO. And its not like your getting a bad set up with 3/1 Force Generation , 2 Docking Bays , and they might try to rescue Han. 


Starting Stuff and setup  You can usually drop a bunch of guys at the Audience Chamber on turn 1 and Prod them with Ability Ability Ability to drop guys NOW  The idea is that Ability Ability Ability will make them either drop guys before they are ready or make them lose force which is always a good thing.

If they do start dropping ability cards  on the ground to any non-Dagobah , non-Shielded Site you will find them and kill them.


Basics of Musicians  You get out Ak-Rev as fast as you can along with Greeata. Whenever your ready to stick it to the opponent you make sure you have Lyn Me and/or Umpass-Stay leading the charge ( Preferrably Both ). With Greeata at the Chamber they deploy 1 and are Forfeit +3 which as you will soon realize when you battle is pretty tough. Other then that you just want to make sure that you get down Dodo Bonowieedo down quickly so you can look at a bunch of your cards in your force pile to see what you need and if you want to draw up. Umpass is a Spy you can pull and that usually means Big Trouble in little Docking Bay. Elis is there if you need him.


Against  Decktypes  


WYS  This is like all I see on Decktech. Endor Occupation is for the obvious Celebration. Those Rebels will cancel a react. You can drop a zillion power on one site. Secret Plans is gonna slow down their regen while you grapple or Endor Occupy whatever they use to get stuff back. Scum means that you can battle like a champ and keep you deck rolling while you just wear them down. If they dont use Insurrection or get it out really really quickly they are gonna be toast while you just fly around and pound them. Guri and Wounded Wookiee will keep the destinies down ( you drew 2 3s  Good for you , Ill forfeit Sy Snootles for 6 ). Against Martin Falke or Bastien Winkelhaus Watch Your Step Id probably put Lirin Carn in the Audience Chamber ASAP and just keep leaving them no force , when they are paying like +2 for each character to deploy or move to the Audience Chamber that should leave you safe until you get your bigger guys into your hand. Also Dengar is a @#$% to those silly Patrol Crafts / Cloud Cars / etc. 


Hidden Mains  Play like WYS , play careful and dont spread out or deploy guys until you have to. Once you feel comfortable put out Search and Destroy and hopefully light them up with that. If they expect to beat you down in one big battle their screwed. Normal Hidden Base would be more of a problem then Hidden Mains , if Hidden Base is big in your area take out the Projective Telepathys for a Stinger and Zuckuss in Mist Hunter , also Id drop the Endor Occupations for Bossk in the Bus and another cool Scum Ship of your choice. 


Neals Scum Killer  Heheh. This is a pretty good matchup. The first thing you got going for you is that he cant convert your junk from the start since the Audience Chamber will be coming from the reserve. Your benefit is that a bunch of your stuff comes from reserve and pulling guys through other cards so that means youll be able to get your mess of cards down quicker then his pretty much every time. Youve got the SAC screwer and hes got Honor of the Jedi and then again you have No Escape. Ability Ability Ability will hopefully give you the quick edge to put you over the edge. Chances are with the way this game will play out Secret Plans will be a pain to him because hes gonna be using force to deploy and do stuff and that extra 1 or 6 for regen seems to lose its priority. Like he says Weapon Lev doesnt do jack to you but Blaster Deflection will be a bit uncomfortable. I use the Ugnaughts so that I have a non-unique right from the get go for Wounded Wookiee and thats pretty critical because you cant let someone hit multiple 5s and 6 destinies on you plus weapons. In this game you need to use Projective Telepathy , Broken Concentration , and track your destinies for your guns and/or battle destinies really well.  Against Neals deck you can really appreciate both sides of the game and have fun duking it out with a bunch of little guys and big boys , and having fun is what it is all about. 


Vs. Anything Else  Just put guys at the Audience Chamber and see what they do , leave the Audience Chamber somewhat vulnerable , and when they drop guys to kill you  retaliate will your low deploy guys. 


Card Selections  


Q Why Wounded Wookiee and not the Combo ? 


A  Because I cannot be Clashed  I use the Carbonite Chamber Green Card to get my Non-Unique Aliens and I dont want them to grapple Wounded Wookiee when Im just trying to recycle stuff.


Q Why Ugnaughts , Jawas , or Abyssins ? 


A Tech stuff. I like Ugnaughts so Im gaurenteed to get my non-uniques for Wounded Wookiee. Jawas are nice to require force from them to deploy and screw their barriers , interrupts , Houjixes , hopes , and dreams. Abyssins are nice for general battles but Ugnaughts and Jawas will be in before them. 


Q Why Elis ? 


A Seems a lot of decks dont start Insurrection anymore and they will pay dearly for it.


Q Why no space ? 


A Im scared of space, they can do a bunch of silly things usually and I cant devote space to doing silly things back to them. If you have Hidden Bases that actually flip then your gonna need to get a ship into your deck to probe. It is fun to deploy the Stinger for 1 and then drop Guri for free though. 


Q Will this deck survive Tatooine  ?


A Id probably put it away for the first month of Tatooine because everybody likes to use their new cards and that Aliens deploy plus stuff on Tatooine is annoying. Qui-Gon just demands to get 4-LOMed or Hidden Weaponed. After about a month you should be able to get a feel if people are using the Alien deploy card or not. Aurra might be worth a card slot as well. 


TURN IT DOWN YOU SAY ? WELL ALL I GOT TO SAY TO YOU IS TIME AND TIME AGAIN I SAY, "NO" NO NO, NO, NO, NO, NO TELL ME NOT TO PLAY ?

WELL, ALL I GOT TO SAY TO YOU WHEN YOU TELL ME NOT TO PLAY , I SAY, "NO"

NO NO, NO, NO, NO, NO

SO, IF YOU ASK ME WHY I LIKE THE WAY I PLAY IT THERE’S ONLY ONE THING I CAN SAY TO YOU I WANNA ROCK (ROCK) I WANNA ROCK (ROCK) I WANT TO ROCK (ROCK)

I WANNA ROCK (ROCK) 


THERE’S A FEELIN’ THAT I GET FROM NOTHIN’ ELSE AND THERE AIN’T NOTHIN’ IN THE WORLD THAT MAKES ME GO GO GO, GO, GO, GO, GO TURN THE POWER UP

GO GO, GO, GO, GO, GO

WHEN IT’S LIKE THIS I FEEL THE MUSIC SHOOTIN’ THROUGH METHERE’S NOTHIN’ ELSE THAT I WOULD RATHER DO I WANNA ROCK (ROCK)I WANNA ROCK (ROCK)

I WANT TO ROCK (ROCK) I WANNA ROCK (ROCK) I WANNA ROCK (ROCK)

ROCK (ROCK) ROCK (ROCK) I WANNA ROCK (ROCK) ROCK (ROCK) ROCK (ROCK)

I WANT TO ROCK (ROCK) ROCK (ROCK) ROCK (ROCK) I WANNA ROCK (ROCK)

ROCK (ROCK) ROCK (ROCK) I WANNA ROCK
