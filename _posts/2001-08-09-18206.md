Strategy: '

General Stategy

Pull out the Holotable and put the Phantom Menace there while keeping a holonet transmission to cancel any TT. When Podracing youll want to pull out your grabber effect with well have to accelerate our plans.Use no escape to pull a podrace interrups like the collision back into your hand and the maul strikes can help you get out vader with his saber soon. youll be force choking your opponent so theyll have to slow down which hurts as visage and drains at the holotable continue. 


Against space mauls infiltrator should cause the opponent to not even have any ability at all with mauls text and if the do sit at kessel with maul and cloak him. the counter assault will also hurt and swarm decks. the arena will turn into a battleground after the race so put vader there.


Senate the senate wont be too good at podracing so that will hurt, alsovader can still choke people there and if they want to play yoda at the council chamber maul would probable love to duel him and drain for 3 or 4.


Overall its played the same as before coruscant with a few little additions. '
