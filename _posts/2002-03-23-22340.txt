Strategy: '

With the SW Hall of Fame Voting coming around I thought I would post some of my best decks to give people an idea about what decks were and how they worked.

***Start Deck***
With the new defensive shields stopping if not at least slowing down retrieving I knew I was going to have to adjust the deck from what I took second at RCon with.  I decided though that making them lose the force from the Boomrace still hurt and if you were able to retrieve that was a bonus.

Here are reasons for some of the cards to explain why they were in there for this weekend.

Leia W/Blaster, Melas, Orrimarrko, Corran Horn, Owen & Beru...All of these guys draw destiny and except for the Lars family, Maul in the Bunker will not cause my charges to go in the used pile.  This deck did not need Scouts except for Blount, Cracken for late game retrieval and spy ability to pull with Madine. 

In this deck I decided to pull midge and that allowed me the ability to play more of the heavy hitters like EPP Han, 2 EPP Lukes, 2 EPP Obi’s and even an EPP QuiGon for plenty of hilling.  

In knowing that space decks might cause a problem due to the shields limiting my retrieval, I decided that I Hope She’s Alright would win my games...which it did against Clint on day 2.  Definate good idea.  

Also, in now having a ton of EPP lightsaber swinging characters 3 Jedi Resilience cards made there way and they worked out huge.

On The Edge x2 were thrown in for retrieval to make up for the lack through the Boomrace.  We Wish To Board at Once, 3 ASBackward and 2 Too Close For Comfort were added in, replacing the 6 OOCs that I knew everyone would be looking to grab, which allowed me to play my other interrupts at will.

Deciding that battling might be more inportant also I threw in the destiny adders (Gift and THISWTO) for maximum damage without sacrifing the high destiny in the deck.

The last big change in the deck that helped me win the games were anti Watto hate in 2 Grimtaash/Shock Combos to limit there hands.

Overall this deck is still a beast in the right hands and I hope to keep it as a viable option come DecipherCon 02 (FreedomCon?)  )
