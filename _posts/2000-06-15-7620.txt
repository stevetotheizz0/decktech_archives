Strategy: 

The strategy is simple, turn the objetive as soon as posible and drain a lot with DD and CC occopation.
Key cards and notes:
- Why two CC Occupations? Is very simple, Endor Celebration is a card very popular now in Madrid and I need 2, when the first is canceled I attach EC with There'll Be Hell To Pay  and no person has 2 EC in his deck.
- Stunning Leader: with the troopers and Trooper Assault is very hard for some decks.
- Den of thieves is obvious and i search it as soon as possible with Twi'lek Advisor.
- Watch Your Back! & IG-88 in IG-2000 is a deadly combo. Your destiny is sure a 6 (Good for the Falcon with Han or Lando). With Lateral dammage it's a super-b combo.
- First Strike make harder use the rebel battle cards like Iknow and similars.
- Tarkin orders (I love it) cancel Rebel Barrier, It could be worse... It's great.

Thanks for read it and, please, if anyone wants correct it, I accept all that you suggest.
