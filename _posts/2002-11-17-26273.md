Strategy: 

*Response*

okay, Huntdown may not be as much of an auto-win as I say it is, it’s just that I have never lost to Huntdown, and Brad beat two of them at Deciphercon. So far, huntdown has been an auto-win.

Philip, take it from someone who has played a LOT of Dark Deal, and played this deck a lot. Barring a really bad draw, the TIGIH will ALWAYS win. It’s faster to the table. Not faster in setting up drains and damage, but much faster getting guys out to sites.

*End Response*

This deck is wicked fast and has good chance against everything. What you want to do is set up your activation as quickly as possible, then start activating and tracking your deck so when your hit & run attacks are as efficient as possible, (hence 3 Landos). Throughout the course of a game you should be recycling high destiny via used interrupts,  Threepio, and Colo Claw Fish, and if you track them properly, youll win or come close to winning every battle, and be closer to converting Vader.(I converted two at Worlds). The deck is mad fun, and it is good at what it does. 

Match-Ups:

Senate: Totally winnable thanks to virtual set 3. Cards like Leia and Scanner Techs are just brutal, and Fallen Portal, Valorum, and Draw Their Fire just adds to the brutality. Dont start Scanner Techs, since early game both you and your opponent will be setting up and the card is useless. Look for it with Threepio/Insurrection, get it out, and start using it. Eventually Leia should come down to Senate (a great combo is Leia and Valorum) to further disrupt your opponent. 

Combat: Hard, but easy if you draw the right cards. The key is tracking your 6s and 7s, putting the spaceport docking bay on Naboo, and then move Luke over. They cant combat him to death since your total should never go below 11, and then when you battle you should be killing their Jedi.

Hunt Down: Auto-Win. Vader takes Luke. You Battle Vader, stack, stack, stack, cross. Really its that simple.

Watto: A good match-up if you get your activation out. Just always pay for the cards they bluff. Think of it this way: You pay 2 force and your opponent loses a force. Cancel Search and Destroy, and  suddenly your opponent goes from 5 damage a turn, to two drains of 1. Get out Battle Plan, and now they should be going very slow. Set up your beats, attack Mos Espa (spaceport DB should go between the two sites), and win. You shouldnt win by a lot because early on you WILL lose force,  but dont panic, come late game you should be on top.

Dark Deal: Auto-Win so far. Attack, attack, attack. Basically every time I kick my opponent of their sites if they deploy early (I get so much force its easy), or I take control of their sites if they wait. (Move Luke to the docking bay, Obi to a site, Quiggy to a site, Lando to support either one, and suddenly they only have 1 safe site and they cant play Dark Deal until they kick you off of CC). Really this a match-up you have an advantage in.

Anything Else: Just fight then fight some more.


People may get on me for some card choices, but if you read  my TR you will see how much this deck has been refined and tested. The only thing I will say is that 1 Luke is all you need. He rarely dies (only happened over the entire weekend, including pick-up games), and if he does, you can Resilience him.

I love this deck, its so much fun.
