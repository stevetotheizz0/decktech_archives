Strategy: '

Ok this deck is a incredibly fast deck and has been Undefeated at tournaments so far...

First turn you activate around 8 or 9 force and you probably get 2 ties and at least 1 system.	You deploy 2 Tie's that turn to endor and deploy Ominous Rumors also and a guy at Bunker.  They usually will not have anyguys the first turn so don't be afraid to deploy the ties because opponent will never deploy anything against you because they will expect you to have All Power to Weapons in your hand and be strong.  2nd turn you drain for 4 at Endor then you deploy Ephant Mon to Bunker and pull a system with Merjek.  You deploy 2 more ties their and draw the rest.  Next turn you drain for 6 and deploy Drednaught's to both sites, (You activate Mad force) you also should deploy Vader and his lightsaber to DB and deploy a system with Merjek (Also Perimiter Patrol will be out because you can take it with You cannot hide forever.  4th turn you drain for 10 and activate like 18 force.  So you deploy more ties at Endor and Deploy Mara to DB.  Now you are setup and powerfull.  This is only 5th turn also.  This deck is really fast and doesn't have many weaknesses.  If opponent happens to cancel your drain Bonuses you still drain for a good amount because most of the sites are 2/2 locations.'
