RalOps '

Strategy: '

First off, I don’t live under a rock. I know all about Ounee Ta. And no, it can’t kill RalOps unless the oppoent plays with it. I havn’t seen any decks with this card. Even if they do happen to end up with a free card slot, they won’t put Ounee Ta in cause they think the Fear of the card is enuff to stop the DS from playing Ral. No I have taken this deck to 4 seperate tournys won them all, and never saw one Ounee Ta. So there, Ounee Ta only works if they play with it.

Second, Walkers rule. EPPs can’t target them and they save guys aboad them from the sabers. They can react allowing for easier control of Ral. With At-St pilots they rock even more.

Third, I know AT-ST pilots are dotted. I just have the two extra if I lose them to force drains or forfeit I can replace them.

Basic Start
RalOps
Ral
Pre’d Defenses
IAO
Mob Points.
You Can’t Hide

1 turn
Pull D*2 Docking Bay.
Pull Carida
Deploy an AT-ST to Docking bay.
Pick up any left over.

2 turn
Pull SP DB
Pull <>Site
Deploy someone to <> Site
Move At-St to DB

From there
Deploy the sites
Control Ral.
Battle and get pumped destiny
Reduce drains
Rip to shreads

Whay cards?
Lt. Comm. Ardan- Imp. Darws destiny if not able.
lt. Endicott- Free to d*2 DB
Emperor’s Shuttle- See How to HB
Blizzard 2- Little More Protection. More power
Overseeing Personally- Add big to drains
Mosep- I let them losing from deck.
Projective Telephaty- Meta choice. Stops Order To Engage.

How To Play
Hidden Base
Normal start. Pull Security Precautions. Then put the Emperor on Shuttle and probe a planet. If they come to get ya. You take no damage, and immune to attrion (SYCFA look alike). Pull S&D and your drains with Overseeing should do them in.

EBO
Set up RalOps. Drop AT-STs at the non-sheilded site. Move in and take over Echo. Drop their drains with the backside of RalOps. Battle in space and win.

MWYHL
Set up RalOps ASAP. Pull Broken Concentraion, if they are training. If Falcon, set it have its system. Kill the rest of the guys. If beatdown, RAlOps’s text should slow them down. Should be easy win.

Profit
No Aliens. Give them Han. Battle after setting up RalOps. Kill Han. Hardest game.

There’s the deck. Ounee Ta only hurts this very little if they do play it. If they try beatdowns, move the AT-STs. If they play aliens, beat them up. If Eloms, move the Imps away and only leave them AT-STs there.

This deck kicks
