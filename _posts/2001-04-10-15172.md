Strategy: '

--------------------------------------

Card List Update - Take out 1 TIE and add 1 Well Guarded

---------------------------------------


Ok, first turn, before activating, use Mob. Points and grab Wakeelmui. Then activate and deploy Wak. and SFS if you have it. If not, no big deal. Start building up your forces at the systems and use the Dreads and SD’s to move em around. Get Merrejk and Brendei out to Docking Bay 327 and grab all the systems and start grabbing TIE’s. This is a pretty standard TIE swarm deck. Get a bunch of TIEs spread around with capital ships to move em around. APTW helps alot by adding power and immunity. Cancel their drains with DIS and if needed, use the little ground power in this deck to do some ground damage if needed. I know this isnt alot of strategy but there isnt much to explain.


Card Explinations


Ponda’s Blaster - A beast if used by Jodo. Destiny +3 to hit and forfeit = 0.


TIE Sentry Ships - Great when used with TIEs to smackdown at clouds, asteroids, or other systems.


Brendei - Pulls TIES


Niado - Good ability 3 power guy.


Matchups


HB Try to probe early on and watch for their starships. Should be a fairly easy game.


TIGIH Dont worry about ground at all. Lose the ground guys to drains and just build up your space power and win the drain race.


WYS Good idea here is to deploy all your guys at once and get em in the Cantina. Hold in for as long as possible as you build up you space forces and crush whatever they bring up.


QMC Right now, auto-win, beat down Bespin, game over. Once Tatooine comes out, Forget about Bespin and your ground forces and spread to the systems and win the drain race.


EBO X-Wings Prolly the hardest matchup I can think off. Key here is just get your ships out asap and keep 4-5 TIEs to a system and capitals to help out. Good thing Interceptors are power +1 with x-wings.


Thats about it, plz review constructively(sp?).    '
