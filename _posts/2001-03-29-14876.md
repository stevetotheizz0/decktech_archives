Strategy: '

uhh... i think everyone pretty much knows the strategy in a throne room deck... heres some matchups

BHBM-


Deploy your Dokcing bays, and give them luke so they have to lose force. You shouldn’t have too much trouble having luke not crossed over... at least i haven’t... win the battles with the destiny adders/clash/SATM during the control phase of course...


ISB-

uhh. just stick blount aboard home 1 at coruscant or throw him over there with some mains or whatever. beatdown to stop the drains at deserts


Court/MKOS

-This one is hard... deploy to your Docking bays to get your activation up- then deploy mains. But watch out for None Shall pass, you could start Ounee Taa to slow it down. 


ROPS- I usually start Ournee tea to be cool... Well deploy to Rallitiir, so they cant flip and its not that hard, because you have so many mains, its not funny.


SYCFA ties-

haven’t had to play against this.. but i’d drop the ships down to wakameeli(?). a well place legendary starfighter will win the game..
