Strategy: 

Strategy
Im trying again.

This deck generates plenty of force. The trick is to stop the early choke and get out some of the other locations. If you suspect a Revolver or No Shelter variant, start Imperial Justice on the Meditation Chamber. The other locations are pretty much immune to Revolution.

Against Hidden Base, start with Security Precautions. Get your locations down as quickly as possible but avoid deploying the systems.

Against Opps, start Battle Order and go fight. Between Tramples, Snipers, Disruptor Pistol, Bubo and Dr E., you should be able to either prevent a flip or keep them from hurting you too much if they do flip.

Secret Plans is a good choice to start against most other deck types. Remember to use the game text to get out Shocking Revelation each turn. Scan your reserve deck carefully. Then you will know whether you want to draw from your force pile or use the force and wait for something better.

Against Mind What You Have Learned, go to the Dagobah System. Land Vader and Tarkin. Kill Luke or Leia if possible before he flips.
