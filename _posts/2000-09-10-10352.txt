THIS DECK IS HUGE  NOW BEFORE YOU GO ALL CRAZY FOR SUCH A FUCKIN' GOOFY DECK, LIKE ALWAYS, READ THE STRATEGY SECTION


This deck is a beast.  I love the way Profit plays, but I hate the way it's too easy to kill Han (sniper, trample, battles w/ weapons) and stuff like that.  Ben Kenobi is such a great card, and he's at his best in Profit.

HERE'S HOW TO SOMEWHAT PLAY THE DECK
You start what's listed at the top.  Now if you're opponent is playing Court and they start a CC Engineer (or if he plays Tatooine/JP start), don't panic.  Use your Tunnel Visions or Nar Shaada Wind Chimes on your turn to get out the CC Technician to convert the JPAC, thus allowing you to pull out Bo Shuda from your Reserve deck.  If not playing court, you still want to get out Bo Shuda.  Unless your opponent controls the AC, you want to release Han with aliens.	Whether it be Tessek or whoever.  If your opponent controls the AC, use Jedi Luke and Ben to battle and hurt em' big time.  You should flip relatively quick (Mara and Chall Bekan (or Jabba) aren't to hard to hurt, are they?)  Some decks like BHBM, Endor Ops, Yavin 4 Occuaption, TIEs, and Hunt Down don't even start aliens.	Eloms can lay the beats (and Court is not a widely used deck in my area, in fact, no one plays it).  Use Nar Shaada Wind Chimes to get H'nemthe to the JPAC and Imperials deploy +4 (not to mention if Goo Nee Tay is out) there and cannot battle.  So sit Han, Tessek, and a H'nemthe with Bo Shuda/Uh-Oh at the JPAC (NO REBELS at the AC)and your drains are +1 where you have a non-unique alien, Han will never die, and your opponent deploys characters for a whole @#$% load on Tatooine (all over if Goo Nee Tay is out).  JEDI PACK HAN IS USED BECAUSE HE IS AN ALIEN, AND ONLY ALIENS CAN SATISFY BO SHUDA/UH-OH.

ROPs gets eaten alive by this.	They won't start characters, and you can probably flip safely by turn 1 (depending on your hand and if you can get Bo Shuda out).  BHBM isn't too bad.  Deploy Luke away from Vader, so your Eloms + other aliens can beat him down.	4 Eloms take on Vader (remember, Eloms are now forfeit 4 and deploy -1 with Tessek at the AC.  So you have a deploy for 2, power 4 NON-UNIQUE alien, sweet eh?	So Vader = power 6 + destiny (or 2 if Emperor's Power is out).   4 eloms = power 20 + destiny.  You will win, and if you can track, Vader will usually die.  Ben will revive and is good forfeit fodder for Savrip (same with Luke, JK and Home).  Hunt Down stands no chance, Rumors might, but you flip faster and start doing more damage, you should take em' to the bank.  You can even retrieve 7 force with the Eloms if you got em' out.  Sense Sniper and Grab it (since Han will be inside, Trample isn't a worry) then Han will never die.

I think I have made a fairly SOLID deck here and I think (IMHO) that it is definitely worthy of a Top 10 position.  And I'm not just talking out of my ass, this deck is 14-0 right now, and my lowest win margin was by 23.  Ladies and Gentlemen, this here is Profit at it's best.
