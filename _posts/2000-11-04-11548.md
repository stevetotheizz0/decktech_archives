Okay in response to Blue1138’s comment
this dosen’t deserve a 3 star rating because you say I need to save 1 star for First Strike. No duh I’ll save force how else am I supposed to play Fallen portal with First Strike out? And if Luke dies against Court It’s no biggy cause most court decks don’t play Vader, And once again Luke will be at the docking bay so if they battle with 4-LOM fallen Portal splat the droid and it will be no problem. And also this deck is not a first try It is 32-4 most of the losses are stupid mistakes or amazing luke on my opponents part.

Okay guys here’s the stats on this beasty.
Average destiny with sites in 2.8

(but those numbers don’t really reflect the draws you’ll be getting with all the tracking you’ll be doing.)

Now on to the cool techiness this deck packs.
 First off you want to pull the DBs out of you deck (duh) you don’t wan the zeros floating around. And only play the EndorBack Door if you need the froce or you are in a drain race other then that lose it.
Next, scouts kick @ss use them in battles with Insertion Planning to kill their destiny draws, kinda sucks when that 6 or 7 you tracked gets reduced by three. And since it takes off the destiny it reduces their power as well which is a plus for you. And Cracken and Blount can pay the Emperor a visit in the Throne Room or cancel Visage.
More tech, you’re playing with Docking Bays and high destinies what card could you possibly use hmmm... Fallen Portal. Don’t fear leaving the singel Elom at the Home One Docking Bay. They’ll play Mara and maybe something else and battle you simle a play Fallen Portal and easily crush Mara or even Vader and leave their 2-2 scrub Imperials to get crushed by your mighty power 4 Elom which also gives you a card for Conflict.
Thats about it for tech now to Statgety.
The key to using this deck is to let your opponent make the first move and then comence beatdown. Give them Luke ASAP other then that battle alot.

vs BHBM
This deck has never lost to a BHBM first off. and it usually ends up with me converting Vader. Try and keep Vader away from the Emperor and if that Fails beat down any characters he deploys and Insertion Planning helps remove the sting from Emperors Power.

vs HuntDown
This deck has only lost once to a huntdown deck and it was because I made some dumb mistakes. But basic just take over the Executor and drain there. Any characters they deploy give a beatdown to if they want to dual Obi let them, use Glancing Blow on top of the high destinies you get Vader will die.

vs Court
Eloms+ Bounty Hunters= dead Eloms don’t use em unless you can get away with it. Use the EPP’s and Scouts to dominate Tatooine but give them a guy so their Obj. flips and they lose the =+2 to forfit. Keep Senses handy for Hidden Weapons.

vs JPSD
haven’t played it couldn’t tell ya

vs Set Your Course TIES
Start the Drain race use the Eloms at the Docking Bays for the extra force drains a reterival with NarShadda. Don’t play any ships until you can give them a beating and get away with it.

vs Any Other Type
Wait for them to make the first move. Attack as you see fit and use the docking bays to your advantage.
