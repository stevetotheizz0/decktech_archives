Strategy: '

I get the docking bays out with IAO and usually have flipped the Objective by my 3rd turn. Once the Objective is flipped I use the Ghhhks with the probe droids and retriev them with CC Incinorator and then get them into my hand with Piett and redeploy them with Stalker at Endor docking bay and move them for free elsewhere. I have a reasonably large force at both CC sites and use the docking bays to run (especially the Endor & Coruscant Docking Bays). I don't battle but except what is given to me and retrieve with the Objective and Incinerator.
Well this is the end product of about five slightly change decks I've posted what do you think? '
