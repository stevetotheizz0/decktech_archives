Strategy: 

	All of the non-ISB characters can draw battle destiny by themselves.  The exceptions to this is Gen. Tagge, for the Imperial City, and AT-ST Pilot for his awesomeness on AT-STs.
	Oppressive Enforcement is for SAC protection, as well as helping the low destiny in my deck.
	Torture is for helping the destiny and vs. Odds
	Broken Concentration is for Jedi Test 1, and Im thinking of adding a Failure At The Cave, but I dont know if its worth the space.
	Mosep is good for all kinds of decks, not just Jabbas Palace
	2 Advisors help you get out the effects.
	I also might add Fozec and Oberk if I can get them.
	Ill add in Imperial Decree and Rebel Base Occupation once I get them.
*If you tell me to put something in, tell me what to take out for it.*
Thanx!
