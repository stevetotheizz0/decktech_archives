Strategy: 

This deck was made to counter the Mains decks out there wich pack 2 Shocking Info's and consider that Manipulation defense.

Start with Tatooine, and Combat Readiness to pull Tat: JP (usually).  First turn pull the AC (duh).  Here's the basic strategy:

vs.  Mains - Grab their Shockers (or Voyeur them if you don't have a grabber).  Use Frustration to take out their Grabbers.  Scan away their mains, and get Occupation going.	You should always know what's in their hand, so group your guys if they have a beatdown crew assembled.

vs.  Anything that starts Yarna (HBX, Speeder/Ops, Ewoks, whatever)  - pull an ability 4 guy, and Alter Yarna.	Shouldn't be too hard with the destiny in this deck.  After that, Scan to find out when you can kill them with Monnok.

vs.  *.strom  -  Grab/Voyeur HDWGITM.  Monnok.	Scan.

vs.  Hidden Base non-swarm  -  Try to hold the system for Occupation.  Hopefully they are depending on Rebels for forfiet fodder.

This deck obviously has some weaknesses.  Hidden base w/o rebels or duplicates, for example.  I should probably add a Security Precautions, and Oppressive Enforcement wouldn't hurt either.  If the LS starts Wise Advice AND plays several Grimmys, that would also be very bad.

LMK what you think.
