Here’s the AOBS deck that I played at the Georgia State Championships and before, going through many different versions before settling on the one listed above.


Here’s the mods made right before states. The version I played up until states played 3 Emperors and was still incredible.

Either way you play this deck, it works out pretty well. I personally prefer the 5 emperor version due to insane average destiny and the better matchup against TIGIH scouts and WYS beatdown.


You get the direct damage rolling early, and if the opponent drops something to the ground, you beat the sh1t out of it. Use A Dangerous Time (with or without Broken Concentration) to keep your opponent at bay. Check your force pile whenever you can to keep duplicates out of your hand.

Here’s a breakdown of how this deck matches up against popular decks out there


vs. TIGIH scouts

Some people say that this is a tough matchup for the AOBS deck, when it really isn’t. If you get a fast start, as this deck often does, then you can handle scouts pretty easily. Character removal is their biggest weakness, and this deck has enough of that to count. Monnok for portals and Insertion Planning. You should be able to get off a battle for around 15 cards in battle damage. 


vs. EBOX/HBX

Hah Monnok this deck as often as possible. Monnok, Monnok, No Escape, Monnok, First strike, retrieve monnok, monnok... you get the drift. After 3 monnoks or so, you should be able to own your opponent in space. First Strike/Broken Concentration really helps here, as you can keep the opponent from playing Organized Attack very easily with this.


vs. hidden mains/throneroom

A pretty good matchup, but not easy. The force choke this deck gives is enough to cause the opponent some problems. Use POTFs to beat guys up at DBs as needed. If you can get Snoova and capture Luke (which is why I played 2 snoovas up until states), then the game should be yours.


vs. Profit 

Start Djas Puhr and Fett with gun. Monnok for SAC, Ben Kenobi, Master Luke, whatever you can get. Keep in mind that your Evader/Monnoks are immune to Sense with Crush the Rebellion on table. Drop Vigos and whatever to Tatooine as you see fit. Emperor at the AC can keep Boussh out of there (Force Lightning).


vs. QMC

Monnoks can help here as well, as you can check for Paths and such. If you can nail Paths with a Monnok, strike on Luke with a quickness. Not an easy matchup in the least.


vs WYS beats

Emperor Palpy is the key here. Set up shop in the Cantina and wait for your opponent to commit Han and/or Luke somewhere. Stay at one site on tatooine, and use Force Lightning to fry Han. You have 2 Force Lightnings, they have 2 Hans. Go to space if you see an opening.


vs WYS raiders

You are given enough force to Monnok this deck on turn 1, so do so every time. Early monnoks should help you win this matchup by 20ish, as you can slow them down trememdously and potentially completely roll over them.


I’ll write more later as needed. 

Have fun with it while you can..
