Strategy: '

on the offensive, the lions must be quick.  take a province by the third turn with a tactician like tadenori, ijiasu, or a beefed up domotai + SOP (and maybe a follower).  if you don’t get decent gold on turns 1 and 2, then just keep dumping personalities until you’re sitting on about 10+ production.  


your worst enemies are the scorpions, but if you get a good jump on them (militarily or in honor) then you should do okay.  as long as you have more personalities then you should do pretty well.


beware crane honor decks.  make sure and duel them whenever possible (they’ll be lobbying for the favor like mad).  keep their personalities to a minimum with your duels (and a dishonored crane is worse than a dead crane).  


use Superior tactics to evade defenders, and use your box only to NEGATE terrains.  force them to waste that extra battle action to destroy their own terrain before they play another one. '
