Strategy: '

I made this deck because it seemed to be a fun deck.  What I also noticed is that it wins to.

    Start with prepared def. and No bargain, All wrapped up, and Secret Plans.	No bargain helps from thoes first and second turn mains from showing up.  It also canceles revolutions which always helps. Secret plans just makes your opponent pay for there retrievals.  All wrapped up is just there to help you capture thoes guys you need to flip the obj.

    I put the Sarlacc in to help you win later in the game.  After he eats a captive you gain some force and your opponent losses some. Nothing wrong with that

    What you do is simple, capture your opponents guys and feed them to the Sarlacc.  If your opponent is playing a space deck, spread out quickly, and force drain.  But don’t spread out to thin, cause thoes darn epp’s can hurt.	Also against space decks get out search and destroy.  That well most likely make your opponent come to you. hidden weapons is also a big help in this deck.  Most likely before you use it, you have tracked the destiny you want.  Most likely a two so you capture one of there guys during the battle or before the battle.	Disarmed is also a most have card in here.  I love doing it to jedi Luke.

    There you have it my Court deck.  I know it doesnt seem like much, but trust me it works.  Also please make any corrections that you see, just write them in your review.  I know this could be better, so just tell me what I need.

Thanks
