Strategy: 

Okay, this is a very simple, but powerful deck.  Get Vader Out ASAP.  Also, try to get Reactor Terminal out quickly too.  Draw, and keep the 0s, 1s, 2s, and other cards that you know you will be needing in your hand.  Put the rest back in your deck.	Start force draining wherever possible.  Also, don't feel scared to drop Vader, with his saber by himself.  If it is choke Vader, all the better.  When they drop somebody off, choke someone, and swing at someone.  Don't be afraid to try and choke Luke either, beause there are A LOT of 6s in this deck.  You should have no trouble spreading them thin, and maybe even winning the battle.

Here are some techs. on certain cards:

Dengar With Blaster Carbine: Great card for beating Ops.  Drop him down, and watch the speeders go bye-bye.

A Bright Center To The Universe: More control against stopping Ops, and other decks.

Lateral Damage: A real killer.	I played it on his Falcon, and he had to lose 25.

Coruscant: Great activation, and places to deploy A Bright Center, and Lateral Damage.

Torture: Protection against numbers. also great destiny.

Jabba's Through With You: Good for adding a destiny, when your bounty hunter fires a weapon.  Also great destiny.

Put All Sections On Alert: If they happen to get on the Executor, drop somebody off, don't let them draw destiny, and just get them outta there.  Also great destiny.

Shut Him Up, Or Shut Him Down: Get rid of Death Star Plans (popular in my area) or Bacta Tank.	Also great destiny.

Nevar Yalnal: Get rid of the droid pulling off the Death Star plans, or any other annoying spy.  Drop Mara Jade, or U-3PO there, and they are gone.  Again, another great destiny.

First Strike: Help prevent against annoying interrupts such as Houjxx.

Restraining Bolt: As I already stated, Death Star Plans is popular, and I found this worked quite well.  Great destiny.

Finally some Techs. against certain deck types:

Against Ops: Start Battle Order and get to their planet.  Try to get A Bright Center On Coruscant ASAP. Dengar With Carbine, will be a big help.

Against MWYHL: Pile everybody on a starship, and go beat Yoda, and stay and drain for the rest of the game.

Against HB: DO NOT START SECUIRTY PRECAUTIONS.	This way, they will go ahead and flip, then you can deploy it, and take them by surprise.

Against Profit: Drop Mara and Dengar to the AC. Just keep deploy there,and if they happen to deploy Master Luke, duel him.
