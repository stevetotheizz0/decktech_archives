Strategy: '

This is a cool and quite different deck to play. Its got no interrupts and hardly no effects either, but it still works suprisingly well Start by grabbing spaceport docking bay and executor docking bay. what to do next depends on what you have in your hand, and how much force youve got, Try to get a TIE with matching pilot with combat response, deploy -1 at the spaceport dockingbay and then fly to the system. also drop a random guy or walker to the executor dockingbay for generation (and dont forget to pull carida with mob. points. Your activation is secured. Put out as many ships to tatooine as possible and drop occupation.

Get the admirals order ASAP, you can either get it with Piet or Phennnir (if admirals orders are popular for light in your area, add another one). This card is amazing in this deck. first of all your TIEs gain immunity. Second your forcedrain is +1 at the 2 docking bays. third, you can send your ships to the dockingbay instead of lost pile. this is one of the reasons i have emperors and vaders shuttles in, forfeit them to the docking bay and send them up again.

Since you activate a lot, you have enough force to both draw and deploy the walkers and the high ability pilots to control the ground. you should have enough power/forfeit to handle mains, even if they draw multiple destinys.

everyone should be able to play this deck
