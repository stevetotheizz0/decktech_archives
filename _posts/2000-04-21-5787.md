Strategy: '

Start IAO and pull the docking bays on the 1st 2 turns.  Since u will most likley pull a vader 1st turn, pull executor db and save force to drop vader down at death star db 2nd turn and flip the obj.  Leave Vader there for a drain of 1 and force loss each turn to visage.  If they come after u, play put all sections on alert to prevent them from drawing destiny, and crush the rebellion helps out w/ this as well.  Drop other characters wherever they are needed and battle the crap out of the opponent.  Since u will prob be drawing high destiny, u should have no prob knocking out tons of light characters with a couple of ur bounty hunters.  With Come here u big coward, u force the opponent to go to a battleground and make themself vunerable to attack or else they will slowly lose force with no way to retrieve.	Many of the other effects and inturrupts play an obvious role in the game by helping to to kill high ability characters faster and to ensure the win.

In responce to reviews and comments, i will replace Res Luk Raauf w/ Hunting Party and Trample x2 with Always thinking with ur stomach x2...hopefullt, these changes will allow for a better capturing environment, and therefore, and easier victory '
