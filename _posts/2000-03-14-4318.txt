Okay so this deck is MESSED
but its funny as hell you gotta admit
thats the way it would be in a cloud city gang
i wish fozec was a LS guy so bad
anyways.. i was gonna use SGT doallyn cause of his black mask but not enough room for a true ghetto playa.  ANYWAYS this is just a sweet deck
gimmie a rating that judges its quality into the concept and not so much how it would do at worlds cause we all know what would happen
PEACE '
