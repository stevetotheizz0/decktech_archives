Strategy: 

This is basically a non-dueling Hunt Down deck using Royal Guards to squash your opponents.

Get Vader out as soon as possible (duh), then get him back to the Meditiation Chamber ASAP.
Card explanations:
Shut Him Up...- Bacta Tank is common in my area, but it also cancels several other important cards.
No Kir Kanos- I don’t want to wory about constant force loss to his upkeep.

Matchups:
HB mains- You simply need to assemle a beatdown crew at one f your many docking bays, then transfer them to wherever you need to.
HB space- You will have a small problem here, but if you rely on Super Chimaera, supported by Zuccuss and Dengar, you shoud be able to minimize the damage.
EBO- See HB space, but be wary of Ice Storms if you go under the shield.
WYS, Profit- Go to Tatooine, and hit hard and fast.  Keep your opponent from retrieving by stationing your fleet at Kessel and initiating battle with any ship that tries to Kessel Run (for WYS).  Don’ pre-deploy, but try to get Mara out quickly (for Profit).
MWYHL-  Leave them alone on Dagobah, but destroy them if they try to go anywhere else.  Drain if you can.
TIGIH-  there is not much chance of not capturing Luke, so just don’t lose battles.  Watch out for Lost in the Wilderness at the Endor DB.

These are the only decks that are popular in my area, but against others, just play smart.
