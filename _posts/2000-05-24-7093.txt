Strategy: 

Always start with IAO and the docking bay.  I dont have coruscant so dont tell me to put it in!
Endor and Kashyyyk are for space drains and activation
Get out the Y4 and Hoth Docking Bays out ASAP so you can flip ASAP
Port Town District is for drains
Use Docking Bays for activation and shuttling your agents around
DS-61-3 and other non-ISB agents are for piloting and kicking butt
Captain Piett is for getting out Probe Droids
Speaking of which,  I included restraining bolts to make the probe droids unable to be battled.
With 14 ISB agents, it shouldnt be too hard to get a 2nd turn flip
Half ISB agents have their forfiet +2
Walkers are for more power.  I dont have Tempest 1 or it would be in here in place of Blizzard 1
Tempest Scout 6 is good when a react
All starships have ability of at least 2, so 2 starships can control a system
Resistance: I hate inserts
Battle Order: Screw Ops
Oppressive Enforcement: my SAC protection
The Objective lets me ignore the deployment restrictions for Probe Droids and Snowtrooper Officers.

vs. Throne Room mains: have a bunch of your guys at the same site.  Protection in numbers.

vs. Profit: start Mara and Bane.  Add to your forces at the AC and drain them to death.

vs. Ops: Flip ASAP, get out Battle Order.  Put 5D6 or probe Droid w/ restraining bolt on their planet to slow their drains.

vs. Hidden Base:  Drain them to death at the docking bays.

vs. RTP: drain them to death, keep leia from escaping.

vs.QMC:  never seen it used.

vs. MWYHL:  outdrain them, kill their apprentice.

Thats it.  Dont forget to tell me what to take out for what to put in.	They dont allow more than 60 cards in a deck.
Thanx!
