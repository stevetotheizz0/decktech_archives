Strategy: '

Thanks to Voice of Law for pointing out Alter combo doesn’t cancel Uttini Effects, make them both non-combos cause Lat. Damage is bad, m’kay.

This is not exactly what I played at States, Ill list the changes for you
Took out
Obis Saber
2 Ben Kenobi
TatDB

Put in
Lukes Saber
2 EPP Obi
EndorDB

Why? I felt w/ only 1 of each Saber I had Ben and Luke running around w/out a saber too often, this makes it much more likely to have them w/ their weapons.  Additionally the inclusion of the EndorDB allows for the conversion of the DS version of this location which makes DB transit very costly.  You sacrifice Ben Kenobis obscenely powerful game text.  I think if you expect a lot of Tatooine based DS decks that Ben might be better, but this version I think will stand up a bit better to Dark Surgeon and ISB/Imp. Command which I think are the stonger decks right now (also might be better against Hunt Down).

Some tech Looking at Hunters Hidden Mains I see he uses Correlia as his HB Marker, so I tried to find a way to make use of this wasted card slot.  Instead play Endor, and you can choose whether to use Corulag or Endor as your HB marker based on what your opponent plays.  If hes playing Endor Ops (or you know hes going to play Endor) you can use Corulag as your base and just wait to convert his Endor for the better game text.

Im posting this deck cause I wasnt really able to find a good Hidden Mains deck that was updated, Hunters Hidden Mains is a bit out of date really (pre-Ref2).  I made a decent number of changes, the most important of which is the inclusion of Sense/Alter combo cards.  I think the current environment favors LSs use of S/A to counter Imperial Command and other nasty DS interrupts.  The Do Or Do Not/Oppressive E combo card doesnt really bother me.  1st off, you can play Honor to limit the damage.  2nd, a well timed Sense of Imperial Command, along w/ tracked destinies and the Super Falcon can turn the tide in space (maybe a little anyway).  Sometimes its just well worth losing 3 force to cancel a card.  Lastly, the other uses for both of these cards are good.  Recoil in Fear can get you a new hand when you need one, making the appearance of cards much more likely.  Unfriendly Fire (or whatever the other half of Alter is) can help lessen a beatdown.

The inclusion of S/A also makes the Savrip playable.  With all the extra mains floating around you are often in plenty of forfeit fodder.

The Gift of the Mentor is in there to fetch a saber or on occasion add some battle destinies, if DS weapons are really popular this could be replaced w/ a 2nd Weapon Levitation.

2 Lukes Lightsaber because I think the +1 defense value on Jedi Luke is helpful.  Makes those bounty hunter permanent weapons need a 7 to hit him (unless YCHF is in play).

The recycleable 6s are scaled down a bunch, you can retrieve just fine w/ a tracked 5 (but I think inclusion of 2 6s is well worth it).

Im not entirely sold on the space package, Id like some improvement in this area but its very difficult to find.  The 61st card of the deck is Chewie Protector, great card, but I couldnt find the room for it.

Thats it, hope you like it.  If I was going to states this weekend, this is what Id play. - Mike D.
