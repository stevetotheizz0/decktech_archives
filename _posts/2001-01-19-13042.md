Object of deck
1st turn, pull Bo Shuda and Endor Landing Platform.  Deploy an Ithorian and 2 Ewoks at each site you can; at others, a few Ewoks.  Use Sound The Attack and Fallen Portal to aid in your defense.  With the Ithorians, Kazak, and Tessek out, you’ll be able to drain for at least 4 at every Endor site.
Underworld Contacts helps v. Scum decks; your AC won’t stay converted by that CC Engineer for long  Ounee Ta also provides for a snap retrieval of a key card, and makes None Shall Pass hurt a little less.
Anakin’s Lightsaber is great for use in defending Endor and enhancing drains with DOS, or giving to Jedi Luke for some off-Endor battling.  Master Luke is in for thwarting MKOS and Scum decks by bouncing key aliens in battle, while Jedi Luke is usable for more general battling and for throwing to BHBM.  Artoo & Threepio are perfect for A Gift-ing, and can make annoying droids go away.
Bo Shuda and Order To Engage should keep the Audience Chamber clear (unless opponent wants to lose 3 per turn), and should lend a hand in being able to free Han at your leisure.
Beggar is nice for when your opponent is saving big or just to get around some untimely Barriers or whatnot.
With all your modifiers and ability to pound any DS forces coming to the Forest Moon, you should be able to win the drain race.
My style of play tends to include heavy drawing, and at the pace I deploy and set up, no fear of Monnok is there.  This justifies my inclusion of only 1 Kazak, Graak, and Tessek.  In play, at least one of them always shows up.  Having multiples simply forms a dependency, which is unnecessary.
I have considered switching out one Out Of Commission for an Out Of Commission & Transmission Terminated, but I don’t fear Hunt Down, can send Lando up to cancel Visage, and don’t want to pay for it.

Any questions, D-mail me.  Thanks for your constructive criticism. '
