Strategy: '


The entire point of this deck is to destroy in 1 or 2 big battles. It's done very well in playtesting against all types of decks. Start Y4 Throne Room, Swamp and Farm (Duh). Get Nudj's out ASAP, and get 1 or 2 characters, and 1 or 2 tunnel visions. Then just wait. Activate, activate, activate. When you have enough force for a real beatdown, play 2 tunnel visions to get all characters you need, and adders to go with them. Then deploy, clash their best character, draw their fire/ frozen assets, and beat them really badly.

You don't need more characters than 11, just get them together once or twice, and you should win.

Vs. HDADTJ Clash Vader and beat the others. I dropped Courage in place of Glancing Blow for 2 reasons 1. It has more beatdown potential. 2. If you cancel their big duel destiny, you should win. The destiny in this deck is very good.
Transterms in, of course. Use TV to get them if you need them.

Vs. ROPs Save more force than usual. Most Rops rely on reacting, and Frozen assets stops reacts cold. Fairly tough game, but Mechanical Failure should help.

Vs. Big Blue This is your hardest game. If they deploy on ground, you should be able to kill them, but if they stay purely in space, you'll have more trouble. Put your mains in space. Get out Battle Plan, Bacta Tank and Redemption. Order to Engage can really hurt if they try to run from your mains.

Vs. ISB Easy game. Just kick the crap out of those annoying agents, and use DTF/FA to keep them from Ghhking it. Use Nabrun as needed.

Against COTVG I haven't lost to this one yet. Beatdown works well, just don't let them capture any of your big mains, and kill them with weapons/attrition.

Vs Ops I haven't tried this game, but it should be easy. DTF/FA, beatdown and Nabrun.


There are a few cards that I would like to add, but don't know what to take out. Another signal, another grabber, and a few more characters would help. Generally, 11 is plenty of characters, but I would like another signal. If you aren't expecting Odds, drop a Don't Forget The Droids, but other than that, I'm not sure.

Let me know what you think-
