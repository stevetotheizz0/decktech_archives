Strategy: '

 
First turn pull general carison and deploy endor. Second turn pull dagobah, yoda’s hut, falcon, general medina, and the scout and deploy them to rendous point. Drop all x-wings on rendous and move them for free to endor. Third turn deploy kassh and deploy more x-wings to other sytems. By now u should have yoda and daugher or 1 one the droids. This how is benzeer works. Move them to dabogah. Have the droid and benzer there. Use on the edge to retieve with portable scnaner. Get one out with benzer then deploy it to use top reserve pile. Use on the edge to retieve. Call 5 and u will get 6. train daugher for one reason force drain bonuses are now ignored. Keep deploying systems. After 5 turn or before flip during your control phase and drain. use revolution on yodas hut for 2. This is a still expiremental deck. So tell me what u think? I want to retieve while draining massive. Yes I know about yarna , i should of put one but dont know what to remove. Give me good advise and good review
