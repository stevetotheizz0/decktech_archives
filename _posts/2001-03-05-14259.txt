Mainly I decided to take this cards out cause the destinies were ass and I wanted to improve them, also I added a lot of stuff against WYS, but I still play dueling HD cause there aren´t too much WYS-decks but more Mains decks.This is some rescue was also added in favor of HNT.
.-------.-------.-------.-------.------.------.------.------
First of all this Deck is for the Meta in my area.Im possibly the only one playing light Sac so Í have nothing for it.Also he needs to draw a 1 and have a ability 6 character on table to get it.So here are some possible Meta adjustments for your area
Disarmed/4-lom - dueling stuff
another DVDLOTS - when I get one )
Imperial Command/Guri - anti WYS cards.
TINT/OE - Sac-protection
Grabbler - also against WYS and cards like On the edge pr sometimes HDGITM.
Resistance -EBO and Inserts

Also I don´t use Executor cause if it gets kicked, then ... you are dead
--------------------------------------------------
Main strategy
Get Rendili before activation then to deploy a DB from your Deck.If you got Empy then deploy ExeDB with him there.Next turns deploy other bays with guys and forfit Rendili with Stardestroyer + some protection.When you get some control of the game and Obi or Luke hit the table prepare to duel them.Either use Operational As Planned + Janus or MM to get your destinies.I don´t use Focused Attack cause I often don´t need it.If he plays TT cancel it, if he plays a spy to chamber kick his ass.Chiraneau in space and Battle Order will win games against ground decks, but now for specific matchups

EBO - protect Visage, get S&D duel and drain.

Hidden Base - same as EBO.

others - duel drain and so on.

thats all for now I think.I will add some strategy against WYS if I can play one but this may take time because we only have a monthly tourny here.((
