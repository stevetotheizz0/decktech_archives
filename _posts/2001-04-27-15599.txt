Strategy: 

If you read the card it says for remainder of game your bounty hunters etc Black Sun agents. Then it says you may not deploy other cards with ability so when it flips you can deploy other cards with ability.



First turn I pull the Spaceport docking bay and move Xizor over for a first turn flip and hopefully drop another character.  I use Mob. Points to grab Carida and try to set up 2 main forces one with Palpy and one with Xizor.  If they are playing air or training I try to sent up Search and destroy very quickly.  Itry to use Jodo Kast, Boba Fett and Snoova to capture and keep Luke off the table.

The Match-Ups...
vs Hidden Base- get direct damage and search and destroy going and use the flip side of the objective to find ships

vs Docking Bay Mains- use hidden weapons and Snoova to get some surprise battles and try to capture Luke and then take advantage off the bonus to attrition and checking destinies on the flip side.

vs Profit- start with Snoova and Boba Fett to get free deploy and move them over right away to get a fast drain.  Play this game like vs a mains deck.

vs Watch Your Step- use Lateral Damage on which ever ship is at Kessel and try to use Zuckuss and Bossk to pound on it.  Take over the ground with capturing.

any advise would be cool.
