Strategy: '

Well there it is.  I am posting this so all of you know what I played at the DPC in Vegas.  It help me get 7th place.  Personally I really do not care whether or not you think it is good or not.  Everything will change when tatooine comes out anyway.


If any of you seen Alex’s deck of Imperial Court, then you will know where I got the Idea from, and since I tested it, I thought it would be a good choice for the DPC.  Now I always like Space Court, since my Court decks on my page are about that, so I made many changes to the deck to fit my style.  


Now this is what I played Card for card, but a lot of the card choice were based off of meta, so like you do not have to play with 2 None Shall Passes if you do not want to, that just works great when they do not expect it since you have Imps in your deck, most think nothing about it.


The Effect choices are to beat, EBO, Swarm of any kind, and Profit.  This deck so far has not lost to WYS ever.  Just be strong in space, and choose battles on the ground.  It has Character removal, and everything you need in a good dark deck.  It is very balanced as well, and if you play smart, and make good decisions you should do well with it, at any tournament.  YES I play with 2 Masterful Move’s and 2 Monnok’s....Trust me, this throws people off all the time.  It is not wasted space.  Both of those cards are huge.  Easy to track is one, and get’s a good interrupt, and Monnok is just good for so many reason, I won’t even list them.


I tested another version that has 2 Emperor’s and a Force Lighting, which is awesome, but didn’t go with that for DPC, because of the choice of have 2 Monnoks.  There is so many changes you can make to this deck and still be a good deck, and that is why I like it so much.  Personally I think this version is the best...since my record with it is so good )


I would tell you how to play this deck against all the light decks out there, but I am to lazy to type all that up, so if you really want to know what to do then D-mail me, and I will tell you.


Thanks,

Tim Guzman '
