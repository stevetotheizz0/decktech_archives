strategy

the main strategy in this deck is to spread and force drain on endor, and you do that like this.  turn 1 take general madine and drop YISYW for close air support before you activate, but dont deploy CAS until you get a tala or tala pilot in your hand so they do not have a chance to alter it.  deploy madine to the landing site and any other scouts in your hand, and then take kensaric out of your deck with madines text, and with any remaining force deploy him.  next turn, you dont neccesarily have to deploy a general, because you dont need to get lando in the falcon right away or gen solo on endor, let the flow of the game decide which you need.  throughout the game keep deploying all your force at the landing site until you have enough scouts to flip the objective in ine turn.  also to get your sites out, pull chewie of kashyyyk with madine, and use chewie to deploy wuta for free and get your sites out with wuta.	also, keep dropping all of your space power to endor until you get rendezvous point, then drop them all to rendezvouse point and move them to endor for free.  make sure to get your close air support up early so your opponent wont want to attack you while you are weak, and later in the game he wont want to attack you because you are so strong.  so once you spread out and get your drain bounus’ working you should have the game.  i have not taken this deck to tournament yet, but i have played it with my freinds and it works well, hope you like it.
