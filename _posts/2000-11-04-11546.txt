Strategy: 

Starting stuff:
ISB Operations/ESA, Coruscant: Imperial Square, Prepared Defenses for No Bargain, Secret Plans, There Is No Try (or Broken Concentration v. MWYHL)

Object of deck:
This is a standard drop-and-drain deck.  2 ORSs on a bike @ each Tatooine site.  Jabba, Ephant Mon, and a few ORSs should be able to hold the AC.  With Royal Escort out, it’ll take sabers and/or tracked high destinies to ruin your ORSs’ forfeits.
The greatest challenge vs. this deck is Mind What You Have Learned.  Against this, start Broken Concentration among your starting effects.  Try to drain as much as possible before Test 1 is completed.  After it is, then be very careful and continue to drain for the average amounts.
Another problem may be mains-and-toys decks.  Against these, you should be able to run around them.  Point Man to cancel Order To Engage, use Projective Telepathy to cancel battles (whether initiated by opponent or by you for S&V retrieval).

Why This Card?:

Jabba’s Twerps: 3 almost-guaranteed-free ORSs to battle; quick and painless 1-time retrieval
Combat Readiness: if I need more Force to react with
Main Course: no more Frozen Assets
Destroyed Homestead: impair a lone Luke or Obi, and cause some damage.
Pitiful Little Band: scout decks are becoming popular; take advantage by adding a battle destiny and tracking a 5.
