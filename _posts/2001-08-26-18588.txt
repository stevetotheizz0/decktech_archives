  THE CAMP DOES NOT BEAT THIS DECK
  ok, now that thats out of the way...

NSP means None Shall Pass )  And thanks to Tarkin for pointing out the Fett thing.  Scratch the ’Boba Fett’, I accidently typed that in (yeah, it was late at night lol)

Basically, You want to beat the crap out of their characters, retrieve from scum, capture them, retrieve at the dungeon, make them lose when they are eaten, and retrieve some more.

 Only one trap door because if they are losing that much force and Im retriieving that much, will I REALLY care if I lose ONE bouty hunter.  And THEN Ill retrieve that character back with another captive.

 While on the subject of retrieval, ummm, Code Claerance? enough said.  That pretty much takes care of Kessel run, On the edge, off the edge, nar shadda, all wings report in, and, uh, I guess thats about it.  Hey, not bad for a little destiny 5 effect.

 In most games, I average about 2 destinies per battle, which give me plenty of characters to batle, capture, and feed.  This is accomplished by deploying inteligently, battling inteligently, and using elis.

 Between Court, Search and destroy, and ability, ability, ability, this deck can also do some serious direct damage as well.  Honor proofed by no escape.

 Dannik has proved very useful in past games, cranking up my power and distracting fire fromother characters (hmmm, I wonder why?).  So far Ive slurped 4 jedi total
  Luke
  Obi
  Yoda
  Qui Gon
 Now if only SOMEONE would play a slow jedi council deck so I can get the other 4 or 5, Id be in business.....

  Mosep is great at turning a few pesksome drains into something the opponent dreads each turn as my control phase rolls around.  And hey, gailid deploys free to moseps site.  all the better.

 Activation is not a problem, pull sail barge with power of hutt, pull passenger deck w/ sail barge, there u have it.  I usually get at least a couple from decks in my area, rancor pit is pulled once flipped, and scum + chall + sail barge = dirt cheap aliens, even with The Camp out.

  So theres my deck.  Not that hard to understand, not hard to master, not hard to make massive force loss.  have fun and thx for your ratings.
