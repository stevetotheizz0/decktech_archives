Strategy: '

Bassically liek I said before, you generate at least 20 force by your second turn, while your opponent only get what they activate. I forgot to add that I start with Rendilli in my hand from moblization points. They wont draw too many cards, and you will have plenty of force for myoom onith.  Use her and Kill off all the unique males, then Monnok and doubles that are left. Then If they manage to get out lea or some non-uniques, kill them off with vader and tarkin or whoever. Then get vader to a battle ground so they lose 3 force. you should be able to keep luke in their lost pile with myoom onith, but if they get him out either go get him or let him be. He can’t do much good without and backup (even jedi luke can’t fight off too many charactors by himself)  PLease review this deck, I am going to a tournie soon and could really use a good review. Thanks '
