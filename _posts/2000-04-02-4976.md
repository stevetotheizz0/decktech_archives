Strategy: '

Usually start (Signal) with Rebel Fleet, unless it's obvious they're playing big blue space, then start S-Foils or Haven.
Get the high-destiny characters on the Falcon or a capital ship, ASAP. Insert Never Tell Me The Odds, get a good power set-up at Kessel, Kiffex, Coruscant. Use Rendezvous Point and Haven to throw out ships quickly. Use EPP mains to take out ground drains you can't get spies to. Pretty simple, I think. It definitely needs some help against Raltiir Ops. That obj. pisses me off. Any suggestions here are welcome. '
