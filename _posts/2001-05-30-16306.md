Strategy: '

                  This is a simple Profit deck using scouts and a lot of retrieval. Here are

                  answers 

                  to a couple of questions about it 


                  Why no CAS with Talas - No room, or I would. 

                  Why no anti-numbers - There are no numbers decks in my area. 

                  Why Redemption - Redemption + Bacta Tank is a very abusive strategy.

                  Deploy the patient to Redemption cheeply, then shuttle him or her down to

                  Tatooine where needed. 


                  Countering other decks 

                  Hunt Down dueling - Keep Ben away from Vader, while letting Luke go at him. 

                  Since Luke subtracts 3 from attempts to cross him, your opponents destiny

                  will 

                  be hurt. 

                  Dark Side Tatooine-based decks - Hit them hard and as quickly as you can. If 

                  you win the first couple battles, they wont recover from it. 

                  SYCFA - Have your ships play tag with your opponents and hit them where 

                  they are weaker if you can. Try to keep Tatooine Celebration on the table if you


                  can, and if you cant, get it back as soon as possible. 

                  Anything Ops and TDIGWATT - Take the battle to your opponents planet 

                  after rescuing Han. Hit them as hard and fast as possible.  '
