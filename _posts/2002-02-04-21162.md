Strategy: '

Update ok I didn’t know about hte deploy ost for redeption so take that out and Obi wan with lightsaber and add in Theron Nett nad red 10.Take out one a jedi’s resilistance and add in Talon Karde. oK after redaing some more review i fianally understand what people are talking baout hte deploy 11 Ben. Secreat Plans. So take out Benkenobi and  put in a fallen portal. also take out a mentors gift and add in another Fallen Portal



Respons to reviews I didntk now redemption deploys for 11. I really dont see how a deploy 11 obi wan is bad it seems like reviing a main charachters is worth it and why is it i cna’t retrieve and depploy for 11 that makes no sense at all.




Well it’s a pretty basic deck Stay on tatoine  use Tatoine celebration and drains and fights a pretty basic WYS deck. In a boutm id game start the Kessel runs. I’m just going to write the why i have these cards for now and i will post match ups later.


Why i have these cards

Ben Kenobi- yes a deploy 11 Ben. I think it’s worth it to deploy him for 11 he can revive any one he like a bacta tank. You can forfeit Mains and revive them i think it’s worth it.


Obi wan with Lightsaber- He has a lightsaber and i can replace Ben if i need to.


Phylo Gandish- she deploys for free and most dark decks use docking bays so ill be able to drain them.

Bacta Tank/Redemption- I think the Fact that you can revive some one and then deploy them for free is good.


Kessel run- I pretty much don’t do a run until it’s about mid game. I have Captain Han and melas in the Falcon so they can do the run. They draw two destinies and can cause a redraw. Its really extra retrieval and when you finish the run you will retrieve it again with Tatooine occupation.


Uncontrollable Fury- Its good to put n Vader it makes them Lose a force maybe 2 every turn.


Gift of a mentor is good because you can add a battle destiny if obi wan and Luke are in a battle with each other.


I only got 2 palace raiders cause i don’t think threes a need for anymore.


I would appreciate good reviews and advice from people. Please don’t right stupid reviews though. Thanks

Some cards i owuld like to add in are No questions asked, Talon Karde, Theron nett and red 10.
