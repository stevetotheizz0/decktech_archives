Strategy: 

This deck was first and foremost designed to deal with revolutions deck, but it's very strong against Bothawui decks as well (because of Imp. Decree). Sec. Precautions takes care of HB, and Come Here you Big Coward of Asteroid deck. However the deck would have a hard fight against M&T with smoke screens. The next version of this deck will have many DS imperial ability 2 characters with 5 in forfeit. Compined with Imp. Arrest Order, Smoke screen would be a minor annoyence.
