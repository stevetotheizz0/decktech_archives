Strategy: 

I start signal and Coupling.  I work the coupling/visored vision combo all game.  I threw in another coupling in just in case they alter it and I dont have a sense or wise advice out.  I get the sites out pretty fast, at least one per turn.  Drop mains and Hnemthes to Cloud city.  The only Cloud City sites i play are drain 2 sites.  The i use Pumucir to add one to the drains, also lightsabers can add.  When i flip the objective, they cant cancell or modify drains where i have a non unique alien.  So i can have a pretty good drain that cant be cancelled or modified.  Also im playing up to 2 visored visions on their turns.  This deck is prertty powerful and can also have a decent drain.  Also, ifor got to add that Hnemthes add 2 to daploy of Imperials at the sites so that help as well.
