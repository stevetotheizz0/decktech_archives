Strategy: 

I have been toying with a DBO deck for awhile. I think the strength is in the space drains - and the power of the squadrons is too much to handle. The mains are in the deck to cause trouble, suicide if necessary. The OTE & hyper escape combo can be deadly. The Skiff is in there for reacts on Dantooine. The forfeit of the squadrons is awesome, I can dump'em in the Doc&repair facility - next turn drop'em for 6 force. Anyway tell me what you think - what to take out and what to put in. This deck is still in it's primary stages - obviously DS2 will make a big difference. So please let me know what you think??
