Strategy: 

Start with IAO. Deploy all the generic sites to Yavin. Don't start too fast: wait until you have walkers and/or Vader to flip the objective. Use Decree, undercover spies, and 5D6 to block opponent's drains. Decree with several Y4 sites easily stops Revo, plus their starting locations are on Yavin, helping you flip and helping Decree. Try to stick to Yavin as much as possible.

Against HB: spread and drain as quickly as possible. Get SP and the big E to probe systems. If they use mains, retaliate with walkers and Vader.

Against MWYHL: get as many early drains as possible, then load up the Bus for an invasion of Dagobah (don't forget to take a walker with you). Lift off from Fondor and speed on over to Dagobah-Yoda's days are numbered.

Against Mains: Wait for the opponent to make his move. If you get lucky, they will deploy their mains off Yavin and get them stuck there, leaving you to drain away. If not, attack the mains with walkers, making good use of your generic sites.

Against #'s: Vesden is your key here. Deploy him with walker backup and spread your characters out, making sure that he can add to each of their destinies. The opponent will find himself facing a total of ~15-16.

Against non-HB space: deploy a minimal force to the ground and use your ISB's as forfeit fodder, blocking their main systems of Kessel and Coruscant. Grapple their drain cancelers.
