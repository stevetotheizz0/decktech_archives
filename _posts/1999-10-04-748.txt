Strategy: '

Notes  This is about as much of a balanced deck
as you can make. It's simple for beginners yet
effective for advanced. Usual play is to use
Battle Plan as the starter unless you feel Manip
is possible ( CCT etc. ). The Hidden Base can be
changed. I chose this setup because you can strand
the opponent at the high parsec systems or the low
parsec systems and drain them down. Between Endor
and RPoint you'll get your ships out quickly. This
deck gets generation going very quickly. Be careful
with Coruscant and try to stay away from there until
you can use the little gametext bonus. If the
opponent has Security Precautions out you wanna
wear there ships out before you flip.

Here we go 

v. ISB  Battle Plan is gonna be a really big pain
to them. TPIFF , HB , Harc Seff , and It Could Be
Worse will help stop any drains.  Order to Engage
and your characters will deal damage and the Noble
Sacrifices will help you to retrieve a nice chunk
of force.

v. DS Ops  Basically all the ISB counters apply
here as well. EPP Smackdown is nice.

v. Ralltiir Ops  You might have to pay a lot for
Rebels but you should be able to activate enough
force to cover it. All the normal Op counters work
here. Also - remember that Battle Plan will let
you ignore the Swamps gametext so you may be able
to surprise them there. Beezer will help v. Reacts

v. Big Blue  Should be a great game. May wanna
be careful with the amount of force you give them.
Try not to flip until the end of the game or you
have to. Noble Sacrifice can be huge here also.

v. Drazin  Noble Sac the captive , Start Scrambled
T to stop Manip. Grapplers will help also. Monnok
won't really get much either.

v. HDADTJ w/ dueling  TRY not to deploy Obi or
Luke unless you have It Could Be Worse and a bunch
of force active. Momaw , Wyron , and Jereon will
cancel Visage and as long as you don't have Luke
or Obi at a battleground site Insurrection will
lock Vader out of the Exe sites.

v. HDADTJ w/o dueling  Cancel Visage and play
normally.

miscellaneous notes  Try to save ICBW for when
they probe so Security Precautions doesn't hurt.
#s protection is in as well as a bit of SAC
protection. Pretty simple stuff but effective.'
