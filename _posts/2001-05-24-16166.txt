Strategy: '

I have noticed that AOBS are becoming very popular in my area and decided to look for a strategy to counter it. While I was looking through my binder, I noticed Coruscant Celebration and saw its potential. This deck has a lot of anti-bounty hunter tech. I decided on a scouts and spies base because of the versatility of its support cards and the characters abilities when combined. hile No Escape is a problem, Kensaric mostly makes up for it. 

I decided not to use Local Uprising/ Liberation for this deck because the upswing of flipping SYCFA as a result of AMVCO would make Coruscant vulnerable to a quick CPI.

Anti-bounty hunter tech 
No Disintegrations is tech against bounty hunters, as each battle you lose characters in, your opponent takes 3 direct damage (and loses a bounty hunter from the battle if Vader is on the table). 
The Scum interrupts provide bonuses when your opponents have bounty hunters in battle against you. 

Usual Signal order 
Strike Planning 
Insurrection 
DODN/WA 
Bacta Tank 
Coruscant Celebration or CAS (depending on if you have Tala 2 out yet) 
other of the two above 
No Disintegrations can fit in anywhere above, depending on what you are playing against. 

Counters 
AOBS- Take over Coruscant and use your anti-hunter tech well, pull No Disintegrations second. Keep after your opponent without letting up. 
ISB- Use Madine to pull Blount as fast as you can to make your opponent unable to get to the 7 side. Put him in Tala 2 or keep him well guarded. 
Hunt Down- If your opponent is dueling, keep Obi away from Vader, while risking Luke, since he reduces his chances of being crossed and improves your dueling. Otherwise, react to what your opponent does while canceling Visage ASAP. 
Space anything A tough matchup. Try to keep Coruscant Celebration out, but rely on drains at your Coruscant sites. Try to use Out of Nowhere combo with Tala 2 to get some big destiny draws. 
Any single-planet deck (TDIGWATT, COTVG, Endor Ops, etc.)- Keep scrubs on Coruscant to keep celebration retrieval going while using the rest of your characters to take the battle to your opponents planet. Your scouts have a lot of Endor-specific text, so if you are playing Endor Ops, take advantage of that text and leave Obi, Boushh, etc. for celebration retrieval.  '
