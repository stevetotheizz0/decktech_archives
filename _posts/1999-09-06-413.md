Strategy: '

Vicious Rumors takes advantage of the Endor Objective by starting with good activation.  It gets out the Endor System, which is just about the best dark system around, and a great place for dark space.  I pull out Ominous Rumors first turn and deploy it.  It will never be cancelled, since I do not play any more endor sites.  All I have to do is OCCUPY the two endor sites that are down and I can drain +2 at two other systems, which is HUGE  I have in many other systems to get dark space rolling.  I have in a lot of ground power so I can occupy those two ground sites.  I get so distracted by people doing things on other planets, so I included U3PO, J'Quille, and Fozec and two undercovers so that I can concentrate on my strategy, and not worry about their drains.  Starting with Surface Defense is awesome because it hurts SAC from the very beginning, helps against numbers, and slows their retreival.  The monnok/ghhhk/masterful move combo is awesome.  I have decided that every single dark deck can benefit from one ghhk, and MM helps me get it out, as well as cancel Savrip.  Also, the two Lateral Damages and two Gravity Shadows are not to be underestimated.  No one ever sees it coming, and it can end a game in one shot.  You Lateral Damage, they try to run away, and when they do, you hit them for a 20 force loss.	The two I Have You Now's are great, especially with Old School Vader.	I can easily pull off Decree, and Battle Order is a breeze.  Lots of ships and IAOrder to beef up the pilots is great, and I have in Sec Prec for HB, and a Hell to Pay to catch Organized Attack, On the Edge, or any other pesky interrupt.  This deck can take on anything in battle, and still get good drains, while stopping their drains with spies.    '
