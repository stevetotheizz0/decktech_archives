Strategy: 

This deck is pretty straight forward. Get out docking bays with IAO, activate shit loads with Mobilization Points, deploy for massive beat downs. I was also thinking about expand the empire on holotheatre(with palpy and vader out, i activate +2)what do you think? The four systems all give me 2 force and a drain of 2.

  vs. profit-start with dr. e and mara, first turn get mara's saber, kill lots of stuff, if you can get dannik down there, you should be able to hold it down quite well. This is were the death mark comes in handy, deploy it on Coruscant somewhere and target han or chewie. they lose force and if they decide to get him there, he goes to used pile. should be pretty interesting.

  vs. tigih- this match up may go in their favor, since without vader out, visage screws me over. i just have to pick and choose my battles well.

  vs. ebo- i can hold a few planets with my starships(especially with the ao's immunity) if i feel lucky ill go to the echo docking bay(still free since you can't add something to nothing) and go on a wild rampage through hoth. i should win this one.

that's about all the GOOD decks i've played against in awhile, so that's all i really need to go up against.
