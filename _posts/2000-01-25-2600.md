Strategy: '

this deck uses no objective (that may change-any suggestions?). It is balanced between ground and space, with counters for almost every deck, and good drain sites. Usually start IAO to get out the docking bays.  this deck has many different planets and very few drain modifiers, so my opponent can't cancel all my drains.

vs. hb start sec. precautions. probe, battle and drain. Your ships are better than anything they can throw at you. You should demolish hidden base.


vs.mwyhl star broken concentration, use he is not ready, and dagobah cave/failure at the cave. MWYHL is popular around here, so i packed a few extra counter-cards.

vs.ycepbt/obd-start iao or sec precautions. be careful who you put at the chamber. you dont need to stop them from rescuing han, just slow them down while you get your drains rolling.

vs.qmc-start IAO if you think beatdown, otherwise sec precautions for activation. go to bespin with a few hunters in ships, don't let them flip or set up cc celebration.
vs. choke-i can get out a 2/0 or 2/2 site to start with, depending on what they do.  this deck has a max activation of like 22 or somewhere close to that.

vs.ops start battle order to slow thier drains. monnok, undercovers, and beatdown thier operatives, while you drain-race in space.

vs. numbers start resistance. get your drains up and running while they scramble to insert stuff to make you lose 2 force
vs. anything else/weired decks start iao to prevent a beatdown. drain the for all thier worth in space.

I'll add better cards like maras saber and tarkin as soon as i get them.  '
