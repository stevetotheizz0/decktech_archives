Strategy: 

start out by deploying the east platform and lando fromr eserve deck. unless you get zuckuss in yer opening draw. he is the best for escorting. becaus eif someone wants to fight him he can move away for free. next start moving jabba’s prize to the audience chamber. you’re goal now is to get jabba and miiyoom onith to the audience chamber. basically draw tog et one. and use the game text of the audince chamber ot get the other one. once you have accomplkished that you can keep yer opponets characters out of his hand forevor. once you flip the objective you can set up dark deal. with the 4 starships in the deck. you only need to control bespin: cloud city long enough to play dark deal. so dont go anywhere else with them just leave them there you should be able to handle yerself. but if not dont worry about losing them. from this point drain from cloud city. and if yer opponet deploys people then play a bouty on them capture via
a: bounty huter weapons
b: hidden weapons
c: all wrapped up
with boba fett. bring them to the prison retieve a bunch of force. and then bring them to the interogation room to hurt you’re opponet really bad. i think this deck is pretty solid. any advice?
