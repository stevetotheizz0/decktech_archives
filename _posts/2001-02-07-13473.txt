Ok... I got this design off of this site, modified it to what I thought was a good deck and took it to a local.  I beat a Numbers Deck by 19, lost to a profit Deck by 7, and an EBO Deck by 8.  The Ebo Deck I lost to becaus I couldnt handle a drain of 6, the Profit deck I lost an endgame duel because I was stupid and should have just battled.  I am wondewring if it is a deck flaw or a player flaw.  I am thinking it’s a player falw.  In which case, please suggest the best way to play this deck.  Also, the *s beside the effects are optional 3rd starting effects.  Against most decks start crush.  Against Profit or MWYHL start Secret Plans. Against anything that could be a numbers deck start YCHF.  Definitely start YCHF against HB so you can get S&D or Precautions.  Get Vader down early and Make them come to you.  Duel When you can and make sure your Destinies are set up.  Thats why there is a Reactor Terminal and 2 Januses in there.  I am also trying to make room for Operational as Planned, Resistance, and No Escape so any advice on what to take out is appreciated (I was thinking Thrawn and the Chimaera could go, but they are SO cool)  Again advice on how to PLAY the deck is greatly appreciated.
