Strategy: '

This is based on Steven Lewis’ deck at Nashville
Grand Slam. Props go to him for helping me get
started building it.
Start All Wrapped Up and two other effects.
Against Mains, start There Is No Try and You
Cannot Hide Forever. Against EBO, start Resistance
and You Cannot Hide Forever. Against a non
interactive deck like Jedi Training start You
cannot Hide Forever and Secret Plans.
Fortify the Chamber is the first thing you need
to do. Then you need to see what your opponent
does. If he decides to fight, capture their mains
and feed them to the Rancor for some mad
retrieval. If they decide to leave ground alone,
ping them with the objective, Search and Destroy
and Ability x3. Scum and Villainy is such a
powerful effect. It gives you mad force retrieval
and cheap deploy. It lets your mains come back
for more.
Sorry about the short strategy section. I need to
go now and I’ll update it soon. Please give me
some constructive reviews.
