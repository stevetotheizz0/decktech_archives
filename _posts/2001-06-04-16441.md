Response to reviews


Okay, fine, its 61 cards. A simple miscount. Not enough to deck me several stars Growl. Take out YISYW. Not many people playing numbers anymore. And I am not a scrub.



Early Game


Using Strike Planning, if you get one of the generals, go get the other two. If not, grab Madine and let the flow of the game tell you whether you need Solo or Calrissian. Then I normally get Kensaric so your opponent has to pay out the wazoo to come and get you. Second turn I grab the Wookie to get Wuta, to grab those sites. Also use Madine to get Carlson, Midge, and Panno.Drop all your guys at the Landing Site, so Dark Side won’t have a chance. Also, if you get some ships keep them at Endor during the early game. Find Bunker and Deactivate the Sheild Generator and keep them in your hand. Get Close Air Support ASAP, then drop a Tala at Endor, and spread the scouts like butter on bread. =) Flip.


Post Flip


Fortify all your sites and build, if you have characters to spare, a small hit squad if the DS gets careless. Have the Bacta Tank out to minimize your losses. The flip side of the objective prevents your drains from being reduced and Midge makes sure your drains aren’t ignored. Retrieve the rebels you’ve lost in battle, then go get them again with Madine. “All too easy.” Also blow the bunker after flip if you can to get the +2 bonus.


End Game


End game? What end game? Your opponents inability to cancel or modify your drains, the tank, retreival, and the bunker being blown should have killed him by now. If not, cough*scrub*cough, you can afford to spread and drain even more. Have Fun


I don’t believe in posting deck matchups, because it depends on each individual player, game, and opponent. Wanna know how to beat decks? Read tourny reports. Then review them, boost your tech rating +3


Thanks for any reviews,

John.
