Strategy: '

SURPRISE, SURPRISE. If you know me then you know that I normally have REALLY long strategy sections. Well this one isn*t that long (at least for me), so enjoy not having to read a 1/2 hour strategy -)

OUT - IN
Take OUT - 1x Clash of Sabers FOR Gift of the Mentor

RESPONSE TO REVIEWS

Cheezwhiz- You are rather confused my friend. I just use Spaceport Docking Bay as another DB to place on Tatooine and drain at. It has nothing to do with OMDH. Also I DO HAVE STAGING AREAS IN MY DECK. I would be stupid if I didn*t. If you look in the Starting stuff you*ll see it.

Hayes - I like having a lot of starships because I really hate Ties. Only 4 starships doesn’t cut it at all vs Ties. As for getting lightsabers, that*s easy. I now have GOTM as well as 2 weapon levitations. Also Dagobah gives my opponent more force as well as making me take out another card (I’d take out Corulag and add Dag & Hutt). Corulag is a nice site and can be used to drain at if I play a ground deck.

   Okay here is another version of my favorite light-side deck, OMDH. This deck is very fun to play with and does very well.

STRATEGY
 This deck is a very simple deck to figure out since it is a mains & toys deck. With a little OMDH thrown in it makes this deck a force to be reckoned with. Now I know that since I use Dash all my OMDH are placed out of play (even if you make runs with the Falcon) but he is worth having since he is a monster in space. Even with Dash out you will still be able to retrieve 35+ force with your 4 OMDH*s.  Dash in Outrider along with Captain Han in the Falcon (and maybe one more pilot to combat Zuckess) can beat of almost anything (together they are power 12, draw 2 destiny, and subtract 6 from your opponent*s power).
   If you are being threatened in space (ties etc) then just add Leia to the mix and you have a unstoppable combo.

   On the ground you have Ben, Luke, Lando, Rimmy, Twass, Furball (chewie) and more. Leia and Corren can be used wherever you need them. Unless your opponent is draining you heavy from a different planet leave you guys on your two docking bays (both on Tatooine). Along with your Admiral*s order and lightsaber bonus* you really make your opponent lose a lot. Fallen Portal is a very nice card since I normally have good destinies in my reserve deck (I use all the low ones on the table and most of the R2 characters are destiny 3).
   If you are getting drained from afar deploy your spaceport docking bay onto their planet (if you can*t deploy it to their planet then chances are that they will have started a docking bay). Move Ben Over if possible and use Luke and your other beats to quench their fire. This deck is MADE for battling (look at the interrupts) so in most battles you will win. This deck also activates big amounts of force, so don*t worry about high deploy costs.

  This deck also have a cool cycle, that I think is worth mentioning. If you are battling at the Tatooine System and have Bacta Tank out as well as I*ll Take The Leader the you can keep cycling your pilots and ships. If you need to lose a lot for power then just lose the pilot of one ship to the bacta tank and then lose the ship. The Admiral*s order allows you to send the starship to a related docking bay so send the ship to the Tatooine docking bay. Then next turn grab the pilot from the tank, deploy him in his ship again, and get him back into the battle.

  In both space and ground you have big power which mixed with your retrieval and direct damage is a big power.

AGAINST BHBM It will kinda stink not having Luke. But fortunately you have many other beats. Get down to just the Tatooine docking bay (don*t use the spaceport) and use the rest of your guys to do dirty work off planet. You won*t have much problem with space. Along with your retrieval, beats, Fallen Portals, and drains you will win most games.

AGAINST COURT/SCUM Would be hard but I am very prepared for Scum decks. Fallen Portal is great for smoking bounty hunters or musicians and Weapon Levitation is to grab Snoova*s Vibro Ax from his hairy grasp. Their starships are no match for your space fleet combined with the AO, so you will have no trouble there (I play COURT all the time and have NEVER had trouble in space). Play right and you will win most every game.

AGAINST Hunt Down Against a batting HD deck you should be able to win almost every time. Get some spy to the Holotheatre and cancel Visage. From then it*s smooth sailing.  As you can see, I am very prepared for dueling hunt down (which may I add, doesn*t even exist where I play). But what the heck, I*ll prepare for it anyways. I have two anti-duel cards as well as weapon levatation (grab Vader*s LS) and Fallen Portal (I nail Tarkin a lot with this card). If you take your time and get set up dueling Hunt Down with be a walk in the park. Retrieve any early loses from Visage with OMDH.

AGAINST SPACE Unless it is Ties it should be rather simple. Until you try out these starships you don*t know how powerful they really are. Against Ties DON*T SPREAD. Keep your ships together (unless moving to Alderaan) and use your AO to it*s fullest potential. As long as you make no stupid mistakes you will win.
