Strategy: 

Well here is No Shelter back a bit with a few adjustments. Here's some more info on how to play it.

v. HDADTJ- Start Goo Nee Tay , Try to find Bothan Spies , dueling cards , and QAMercenary ASAP. Grimtaash might also catch key dueling cards the opponent has.

v. Ops- Get Obi to Toschi Station ASAP and then bring down beatdown for massive damage. I've not seen Main Course in a deck yet so Frozen Assets is still strong. Grimtaash hard also here.

v. Manip- Scrambled Transmission and 2 Shocks will put the hurt on the Drazin deck and those 2 Bothan Spies are keys to putting a hurt on the shy stormie. Battle Plan will slow this deck down if things get bad.

v. anything in JP - converting their JP will hurt them badly. Signal for Goo Nee Tay and then run with it.

v. Space Decree or something like that. These will usually be the best games because Space Decree seems to be the bane of like every deck I built. Use the Savrip to do all your work while you poke a Revolved Hut drain into them to win.
