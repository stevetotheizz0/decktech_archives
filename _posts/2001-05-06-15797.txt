Strategy: 

Using your starting interupts get the locations
out soon.  Most of the time you will have a
vader in your opening hand, and with enough force 
from your opponent you should be able to flip on 
the first or second turn.  Of course if you didn’t
draw up Vader, get him soon. Use the other 
characters in the Deck at your leisure. You may 
not want to keep Vader alone, but if he is on 
Cloud City, with Crush he is safe from big 
beatdowns, and is able to get the almighty "I Have 
You Now." Also, with the dueling cards and a 
lightsaber, Vader can sit back and chill. Never get
vader out of play (or I hunt you down and beat you :P) 
Keep Visage alive with HoloNet Transmission, and 
if it dies, deploy another one. Visage is God in 
this deck due to its destiny, the physical effects
on the opponents deck, and the physcological 
effect on the opponent when they have to lose the 
force.  There are a lot of cards and strategies 
in the deck to go against all types of Lightside 
decks. Suggested strategies against certain decks 
are:
Hidden Base- deploy ships and Security Precations
             and the base
TIGIH scouts- capture Luke with someone besides 
              vader, flip your objective, transfer 
              Luke to Vader and do the duel
Hidden Mains- Duel a lot, and cancel retrival
Jedi testing- Use Gall to invade Dagobah
WYS- cancel retrival and play off the stupidity 
     of their objective
any deck that is based on Tatooine- go there and 
                                    kill stuff
EBO- focus on you objective and try direct damage 
     space battles
any other decks- most other decks are stupid and I 
                 don’t want to explain the simplicity 
                 of beating them.

Cards you may be confused on:
Sense: your worst enemy is Glancing Blow
Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down: Cancel Stuff
This Is Some Rescue: Cancel Stuff
Point Man: Cancel Stuff 
Operational As Planned: Put Stuff Back
Masterful Move: Cancel Stuff
                Get Visage protection
                Get Visage
                Put a 6 destiny back when there are 
                   are no Holograms

Final words on deck:
It works for me tournaments. Just trie to keep the
small destinies out while keeping the big ones in.
Do not be afraid of the blind duel.
