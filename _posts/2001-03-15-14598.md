Strategy: '

I will explain right now.  I don’t play SAC protection.  I can’t start it and I don’t need a 1 destiny floating around in my deck.  Also, nobody plays more than 1 or 2 Sense/Alter in my meta.

This deck is an expert at direct damage.  ( I wan’t to add in an IHSAR)  Advantage whips when you kill a Vader/Mara/Jabba/Zuckuss, the like.  Civil Disorder really helps later game (It helps early but is better later). DTF is nice for retrieving and force loss.  (they won’t fight you too much)  Order To Engage is a killer when combined with Clash of Saber/Rebel Barrier. 

Okay, first turn pull a system and matching DB. Repeat on second turn.  Control your locations and go to the opponent when your ready. You should have all the 0’s out of your deck by third turn.  You mainly will hold your stuff and react to the opponent.  

Here are some reasons for the cards I use 


HB Obj.  Pulls systems.


Palace Raiders Forfiet fodder.  Awesome when in Patrol Craft.


Artoo 6 destiny, anti-Scum (A Gift)


Characters 2 of each Jedi/Skywalkers is plenty in this deck.  1 Han  because of the ’prize’.  Chewie cancel Dr. E’s game text.


Starship mix can easily hold 2 sytems.


ITTL Adds to drains.  Anti-TIEs


Starting stuff can pull everything I need except for Charcters (not including Interrupts/Effects)


Order To Engage Clash of Sabers and Rebel Barrier really enhance this card.


A Gift Anti-Scum


DTF Retrievel/force loss.  Makes ’em save force if they play interrupts such as Jabba’s Through with you, etc.


Civil Disorder Can hurry them into weakness.


Advantage Kill a >3 and it hurts.


Menace Fades+Bargaining Table Stuffs drains.


Traffic Control Helps your differential


WHAAAAAAAAAOOOOW Anti-Court, 7 destiny.


Rebel Barrier Works with Or. To En.


Clash of Sabers ditto.


Double Agent kills Mara, 6 destiny


x2 The signal pulls your damaging stuff.


Anakin Skywalker one of the more disputed cards in the deck.  I use it during duels and such.  I have turned two vaders. (one in a new age ROPS, one in Huntdown.)


On The Edge  Retrievel



Now for the matchups 


ROPS Go to Ralltiir sites and prevent them from flipping.  Try and turn/kill Vader.


Huntdown try and Disarm Vader if they flip.  Otherwise, go after him with Han/Chewie/PRs in Patrol Craft.  Can be tough.


BHBM Give ’em JK Luke and your destinies should win duels.  I Feel The Conflict makes ’em pay for losing.


Court/MKOS/CCT Use Artoo/A Gift to stuff their drains.  Go free Han.  Patrol crafts will wreak havoc. (they can react using DB Transit) 


AOBS Die Xixor   Heh heh


TIEsITTL will hold them down slightly.  Keep to one system or the other and try to out-drain them.


I can’t think of any other matchups, so have fun '
