Strategy: '

Use any methods to pull both fetts and the prison. Get Lando using the prison and put him down, gamble, retrieve, steal, repeat. If they want to fight, expand the port town to help you, if not, expand the casino and stick lando in the security room. Otherwise, go to them.

This deck does well against most decks. The only thing it has a real problem with is EBO. I'm taking suggestions on cards to put in to help out with the deck against it, because everybody's playing it over here. '
