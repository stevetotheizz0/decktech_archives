Strategy: 

Not much has changed since the last version...I removed the Ice Plains and DSSD in place of a third twilek to get my effects out faster and a ghhk for added protection. The loss of the Hoth site shouldnt hinder decree should I set it up because I still have 4 Reb base locations (Counting forest and swamp which can deploy to Y4). DSSD wasnt contributing much with its high deploy cost anyway and with 8 big ships and the high forfeit Imps to back it my space superiority shouldnt be threatened.
