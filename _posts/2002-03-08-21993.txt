Strategy: '

I am still new on the EP1 Closed Enviornment Tournaments. (I have ran more than I have played in.)So any advice will be helpful.

This is mainly a space deck
-Deploy Systems (Use First part of Mindful of the Future)
-Use Get to your ships to deploy matching pilots to ships.(If any systems are out)
-Start deploying a group of Jedi,  then use Odin to transfer to your opponets ground forces.
-(IN THIS DECK)The power is in the numbers not in the destiny.
-Pod-race to get some force back.
 This is a power-deck.
Easy for players like me.
