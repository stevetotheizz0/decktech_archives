Strategy: '

alright this is how I start this deck.


get my two sites before I activate, and

drop ychf for s&d. activate deploy locations,

get cc with objective. draw.


2nd turn deploy my characters. get the east

platform if I need it, or have the force to

deploy there. dark deal is now in play,as I

get that from my objective on this turn.

insert disturbance in the force.

and if the draw was really good maybe occupation

this turn, or the turn after,etc. deploy

s&d, deploy the AO if drawn, or if piett’s

on the table and I have a comm.or gen. deployed

as well.


Alright opponents 2nd turn

they activate 1, trooper sabacc

they activate 1, cc sabacc

they activate 1, uncertain is the future.


now by design through all that action the insert

popped and they have no force. because when

that happens essentially their turn is over.


and then on your next turn dd does its damage.


this deck is about damage, DD, occupation, s&d

and AO. it’s alot real fast.


and this deck worked at dpc(not every game.)

just like described above, sabacc, my opponent

activated his 2nd force and pop. his turn

ended, and on my turn I had free drain of 10


his turn he got 1 character on cc, I kissed the

other one, and then on my turn I beat down that

character with my extra characters in hand.


this version is not as fast as Hawkin’s version

but I like it a little better For being versatile

enough to battle and I have cc sabacc for a little

retrieval as well as trigger the disturbance. and I will probably do some

extra tweeking with it, more ships, and get

xizor in here, cause he’s BUFF


thanks. -Dan Kitsman ;)  '
