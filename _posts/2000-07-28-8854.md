Strategy: '

It came about after waking up one morning thinking about the dark side decks using docking bays with Mobilization Points for mad activation. So though it only has force activation of 2 to start, it jumps up superior to anything quite quickly. The speed with which this deck can work is comparable to an ANSB/Dagobah/Yoda's Hut/mains deck, but this doesn't give them the three force from Dagobah and the 4th Marker. You don't even need to give them ANY force if you don't want. Here's how the beginning usually goes (for this simulation, we will assume the opponent gives no force ever)

Turn 1
Activate 2
Search reserve for Home One DB
Deploy Home One DB
Deploy anonymous scrub for 2 to the DB
End turn

Turn 2
Activate 5
Search reserve for Echo Docking Bay
Deploy Echo DB
Deploy anonymous scrub for 2 to the Echo DB
End turn

Turn 3 against ROps
Activate 8
If they've deployed their DB to Ralltiir, deploy yours. Otherwise, deploy a different DB.
End turn unless you feel you have enough to deploy a big main and hold on to him.

Turn 3 against Court
Activate 8
Deploy Tatooine Docking Bay and track your Cantina for drains
Deploy someone strong to the DB

Someone told me, "It gets terrible activation to start." I say, "It's much more economical, and just try it out. You are an idiot." Heh, he didn't believe me till I beat his ROps by 32 with hammering mains all over the place. You really can get swift activation, and then the deploying of your DB + Hnemthe + Goo Nee Tay on top of that is really a kick in the balls.'
