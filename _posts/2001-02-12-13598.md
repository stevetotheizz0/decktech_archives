RESPONCE TO REVIEWS

Serpent - 2 Owen/Beru works fine since I can grab them so fast with tv. Also I always normally put them in a patrol craft if there is going to be a battle with blasters. Also I did pull 2 tv’s for the 2 of the tv/control combo.

 
Mr Cheese - great ideas...but please tell me if you EVER find any cards to take out for those 4 cards. This deck is packed. 
Jon Y - yes a grabber would be nice...please lmk of any cards u think i could pull for it -)

The Rattler err I can*t believe it...did u look at the deck? WHEN I FLIP S/A IS CANCELED & I basically have 4 TT so i don*t need another...golly read the cards man. 

dew dawg Hunt down is easy. I have never lost a game and I always cream it. They have no dueling and no Visage...so it*s just battling which I always win.

 lbmyers1  Actually...I have played an imp command and guri/jodo kast decks and still done really well. I don*t have I*ll take the leader in my deck because space really isn*t that importent to me. Even without ITTL I can still beat up on ties with Han & Dash. 
Darth Dan - Owen and Brew deploy FREE to lars MF so no they don*t cost a ton. 

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I NEED TO CLARIFY SOMETHING So many people have said *watch out for S/A* but I do not need anti s/a cards. My objective CANCELS S/A (cannot be played). Okay? thanks. 

This (as you can tell) is my WYS Harvest deck. At first I built this as a secondary deck to play with when I got bored with my OMDH (Return of the Jedi-New Age OMDH), but it has done so well that I am making it my primary deck. The power of Harvest combined with the WYS obj and the multiple high destiny in this deck really makes it a beast. First I would like to explain a few cards. 


TUNNEL VISION This is part of what makes this deck so powerful. With the WYS objective my three TV*s become 6 TV*s, thus allowing me to get almost any card I want. And if you don*t know how having 3 TV*s basically gives me 6 then read the flip side of the WYS objective (the part about interrupts). 


BACTA TANK This card is soooooo good in this deck because my guys are so cheap to deploy and so high forfeit. This is an auto card in my deck. 


I HOPE SHE*S OKAY To help cream ties as well as other space decks. 


The cycling in this deck is just incredible. With harvest and tunnel vision I can get any card from my lost pile within two turns. 

For example I played a deck recently that packed a ton of Star destroyers to drain up in space as well as many undercover spies (to stop drains on the ground). Right when he dropped his first undercover spy down I tunneled for Reveled and promptly toasted his undercover spy. On the same turn I played harvest and retrieved the Reveled. On my friend’s turn he again whipped out an undercover spy, which he thought would work. On my turn I activated, played tunnel vision, pulled Reveled out of my force pile, and again slaughtered his undercover spy. This cycle kept going on until he ran out of spies (he never blocked my drain). At the end of the game he said how amazed he was of all the cycling I did. I do this with almost my interrupts and it is nasty. 


The harvest/On the edge combo is soooo nasty. What you do is play harvest retrieve any 3 cards and a destiny 6 card. Then track the 6 until it*s on top and play On The Edge to retrieve 5. Then play harvest again retrieve the On The Edge, a destiny 6, and 2 other cards. Track the destiny 6, Tunnel for the On the Edge if you have to (if you don*t have another) and repeat the cycle. This is also nasty against grabbers b/c most people only play with 1 grabber (if they play with one). So when they grab harvest (they will since harvest is better then On the edge) get your cycle going and keep playing your On The Edges as well as your remaining harvests. If you do this right you could retrieve 56 cards And this is WITH HARVEST GRABBED. If neither of your cards get*s grabbed then you will retrieve even more. REMEMBER that you can pick which cards too retrieve when you play harvest so always grab the On The Edge*s and a 6. This cycle is VERY nasty.  

Along with the cycling you have the wicked high destinies as well as the ability to draw unbelievable amounts of these high destinies. Remember that harvest can also be played with Luke and Owen/Beru to add another two destinies. 

For example I played one game in witch I had Owen/Beru, Chewie, and a Palace Raider on a Patrol ship at the Lars Farm. I also had a Luke at an ajecent Tatooine site with a harvest in hand and my objective flipped. My opponent deployed Mara, Tempest 1, Blizzard 2, & Boba Fett to my Lars Farm and battled. I played *Run Luke, Run* on Luke and moved him over to the farm. I played harvest (destiny adder part) and drew 5 battle destinies, which equaled 24 together. Suffice to say I cleared out the whole site while only losing the Palace raider to bacta tank. 


Before I get into the deck strategies I would like to say 4 quick things. 

1. I do not have a hard time with force activation. With someone at my docking bay I activate 10 force every turn BY MY SELF. These smugglers decks are just like court decks because they both have wicked cheap guys. Along with the force I am given from my opponent I activate more then I can use. Activation is no problem. 


2. I have played an Imperial Command deck before and done quite well. Sure only drawing one destiny does hurt but I still did fine and even beat him off. 


3. IF MY HARVEST OR ON THE EDGE GET*S GRABBED THAT*S FINE. As I said I*ll still retrieve TONS of force.  

4. I only have 2 ships in this deck so that I can drain @ Kessel if I*m playing a weak space deck (like court) or to deliever some surprise attacks (I normally have howjix in my hand when I do this). These ships are monsters together. 


5. Secret Plans does not hurt me since I can get around it with the small increments of retrieval.  

This deck is a machine, play with it right and you will do quite well. 


AGAINST BHBM This will be a tougher match-up since you lose Luke. Use Luke to drain for at bit at cantina or to do some hit and run attacks (until Darth gets him). Don*t spread to thin and get set up fast. If you don*t do anything dumb you will win since you have very high forfeit and will be able to smoke everything that comes against you with destinies. 


AGAINST COURT WYS decks have a much easier time with COURT then mains do. The destinies really hurt their Bounty Hunters and my guys are so high forfeit. Get bacta tank out ASAP and keep recycling your wicked high forfeit guys. Playing interrupts from my lost pile really hurts court as well since I can keep playing stuff against them. Drain at Kessel and toast any ships that come against you (easy, I have never lost a space battle). Really shouldn*t be a hard game. Oh and BTW, grab Snoova*s axe from him with weapon levitation. 


AGAINST HD On my first version of this deck people kept telling me HD would kill me…Actually it is one of the EASIEST games  I have won every single game against hunt down easily. With 6 TV*s it is REAL easy to get a TT fast and cancel visage. Always cancel Vader*s Obsession with Run Luke, Run (you will never get dueled since you can play them from lost pile). Since dueling is dead that just leaves the battling which I always win. Really VERY easy. 


AGAINST OTHER BIG BLUE DECKS Same as hunt down….really quite simple. With the retrieval and multiple destinies they don*t stand a chance. 


AGAINST TIES Haven*t played much, but so far I am 3-0. I hope she is all-right really hurts tie decks as well as your drains and retrieval on ground. Believe it or not, but in the one game I played vs ties I actually beat up on my opponent’s ties with only by two ships and a few pilots (outrider was L.Damaged as well). I just kept losing my REALLY high forfeit guys to bacta tank, and then kpt bringing them back. My multiple destinies kept our power even as well as made him lose a ton of ties whenever he didn*t have an APTW. Space really isn*t very important for me but I like to have those two ships in there so that I can beat up on people. If you lose space then big deal. Not a hard game    '
