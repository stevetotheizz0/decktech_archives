Strategy: '

Always start 5th/3rd markers. Try to get out the locations when you get them. Pull holotable when u get a MM.

Against HB Establish a presence on the table, and drain at the 3rd marker. Use ships to cripple them. You can out last them in space. Monnok late game will help. Stack high destinies, use counter assaualt. This deck has uncanny destiny. Drain in space. Probe. This can be a tight game, HB is dead soon, so dont meta too much against it.

Against Testing Drain some, wait for them to come fight you. Usually they will give you a place to go to (CC). overtake them and drain.

Against Mains Out Fight them. You Can DO IT


This deck is in its prelim versions. I have tested it 2 times, and won both by 28 and 41. The first was against Testing, and the second was against a HB deck. They lost 20something to a CA. Ouch...

Requires play skill, tracking, reading your opponent. '
