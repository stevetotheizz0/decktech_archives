Strategy: '

This deck has a good opportunity of winning when played right. I know the destiny is low and I won’t hit that much but I just can’t find away to make it better. Tracking makes hitting easier also.

IAO and Mobs work great for me in the beginnig of the game for that extra activation. IAO also lets me get another site to Rops early. Mobs lets me pull Rendili if I need to go there or I know that my opponent has no space I can go there and drain for a good 1.

The ground power in this deck is great and can hold its own against any lightside ground deck. Tramples, Sniper, Hidden Weapoms and all the weapons make holding or taking sites easier.

My space is week, but I only go to space if I know I can hold a site or take one. If its late in the game and I know my opponent won’t play any space, I go to Rendili and drain.

If you have any ideas on to change this deck and make it better, let me know.

Card Choices
Hidden Weapons - Makes getting rid of those jedi that you can seem to kill easier.
Janus - Adds 1 to force drain when with the Emperor and makes tracking easier.
Imbalance - Pretty good destiny and is great when opponent retrieves force, which is a lot.
Rachalt Hyst - How often does an opponet draw an interupt for destiny?
Snoova - Easy to capture people with.
Arnet - Great pilot and a heck of a guy.
Xizor - Can hold a site by himself.
