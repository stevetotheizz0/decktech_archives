The Low Down This deck has the basci startegy of any other mains deck, but it just has a few twists for the better. Our most desperate hour is very solid with Dash, Home one, and OMDH x4 you could be retrieveing amounts in excess of 30 force. Dash and the Outrider can also battle great in space. Combined with the falcon and a punch it your almost invincible in space. Dont forget you can always add leia to the falcon or Outrider.


Defense You can keep saving your pilots in space with bacta tank and putting them back on there ships to battle, OMDH, or Drain in space. 


Matchups 


Hunt Down If you are playing a battling hunt down you shold be able to win almost everytime. Get Tat DB down and use the rest of your forces to go to them and battle. Use one of your spies to cancel visage and beatdown any character there. Make huge beatdown with Jedi Presense, Fallen Portal, and Wepon Levitation. Against dueling use Run, Luke Run or Courge. These are a great help agaianst duels. TMT & OCC is also great becaus eit slows them down and gives you more time to set up a beatdown. Retrieve with OMDH and battle in space if needed. Tough matchup, but if played right can be done. 


BHBM Use luke really early for a suuicide run then hand him over. Use your mains and Jedi Presense, Fallen Portal, and Weapon Levitation. To lay beatdwon all over the table. Use OMDH to retrieve and win if you played it right. 


Scum You can beatdown and drain at opponets sites and cancel S & V. Dont let them attack you. Levitate Snoovas Ax and Maras Saber. Make them lose tons of force with Jedi Presense. Retrieve with OMDH and if you play smart you can win easy. If they come to space foght them their with the falcon, Outrider, and Punch IT. 


Endor Ops Infiltrate the bunker and beat them down at the docking bay. Kill them at their weakest points in space and Drain on the ground. Retrieve with OMDH and Win. Simple. 


Ties Very tough matchup, dont spread to hin and use Punch It to battle in their weakest points. Your retrival is so high they won’t have a chance if you play right.
