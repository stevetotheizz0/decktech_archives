Objective:
Bring Him Before Me/Take Your Father's Place

Strategy: 

What I'm really looking for is what I should take out and what I should put in. I think I've got most of it covered, but I know there are some weaknesses.
Profit should be fairly easy, hurry and grab Luke and start dueling asap. Drop Mara and Jabba quick to kill of mains. If it gets bad move the emperor over and force lightning ahn and play young fool.
EBO shouldnt be too much of a problem, there space wont be overwhelmingly huge, and with the force you generate plus ships you have, you can go around doing damage.
Hidden Base is the same story, hurry and probe and if they dont have Luke, theyll be in trouble.
Mind What You Have Learned should be no problem, most test Leia, and if they dont want to lose to your destiny theyll drop their Luke so start dueling and make them lose.
Rescue the Princess should be no problem either. Once they rescue Leia, move over with Emperor and try to force lightning and young fool her, then game over.
There is Good in Him is the only deck I think will give you trouble. Try to grab Luke asap and begin dueling. Plan battles wisely because these decks have the potential for massive beat downs. It will be a good and close game.
Well I think I've covered it all, if there is anything i should add or delete just let me know and dont grade too harshly.
