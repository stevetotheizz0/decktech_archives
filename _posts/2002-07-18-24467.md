Strategy: '

Please actuall read the strat if u are going to review my deck.


First off, I have played this deck in four tournaments, making it 12-0.  Two locals (beating Nick Jones, 1930; and Keith Watabayashi, 1924 more than once each), the Endor Regionals (beating John Hawkins by 35), and RebelCon just last weekend.


The first thing that you should do is use your start to intimidate your opponent.  You should say something like, ’I have 6 more cards in my life force than you do.’  It doesn’t always work, but it is sometimes funny when they realize that you are right.


Card choices

Masterful Move, holotable

  I like to take the holotable into hand, then not deploy it. I somehow put it back in my deck, and track it for overload.  then i take it back out with masterful move, and either deploy it or pitch it.


P-59 x2 and wounded warrior

  He is one of my favorite characters, b/c he almost always hits with this sick destiny.  Then, when he hits, u say ’lose two’, and he says ’I don’t have to b/c of honor’, and u say I occupy three battlegrounds’, and he says ’o’ or ’@#$’.  Then u play wounded warrior, making his Jedi Luke with lightsaber prof. power 0, without a destiny draw.  Or pair him with Dr. E.


Always Tinking With Your Stomach

  High destiny makes their good character go under the location.


Omni Box & It’s Worse x2

  I hate It Could Be Worse, and it is a nice recyclable 5.


Circle

  Hyperdrive plays with about 4 obi’s, he gets placed out of play and they are hurting.


Maul Strikes x2

  Great Card.  Look for a saber, off a jedi, add one or two destinies.  What else could a card do?


Overload

  Kill a beefy character with a weapon.  Or that annoying x-wing with cannon.


Shut Him up or shut him down

  Cancels Bacta Tank.


Elis Helrot

  If u pull this card off, it is almost guaranteed to put a hurt on your opponent.


Furry Fury

  He puts down H,C, and the Falcon.  U play this and draw higher than he will for his two destinies.


Security Precautions

  HB flip has not yet died.  At RebelCon, i think that their were four people playing it.


Restraining Bolt

  Almost everyone has 3-PO with his parts showing.  It makes it easier for LS to track.  Now he doesn’t.  And it is a destiny 6.


Match-ups

 WYS

  Put out Mara and saber from reserve first turn, if possible.  Put Maul down at his site, and get his butt into the Cantina.  Beat his @$$ if he comes to the ground, be careful in space.  Save the overload for a cannon.  S and D will probably hurt him.  If he puts luke on ground, make him wish he hadn’t with an I Have You Now beatdown.  If he is paired with someone else, then remove him after playing it.  Not a problem, b/c u can drain harder on the ground than he can in space, and you want him to come to the ground.


 Hyperdrive

  Circle Obi.  Play Always thinking with your stomach to make qui-gon missing at the junkyard.  Maul strikes will be awesome this game. Let him stack scrubs at the junkyard, then counter assault it.  Take over the junkyard.  Overload qui.  whatever.  If you lose, then you suck, b/c u have superior ground.


 QMC

  Catch path.  Beat the sht out of them on ground.  be relentless.  u will most likely get to play elis, making the game far more fun for u.  Say for instance that he has qui with stick at a site, and pucimir at another.  drop P-59 at pucumir’s site.  He gets a big grin, thinking that he will kick your @$$.  u shoot at him, hit, wounded warrior, he paths qui over.  u play elis. now maul is there.  he swings, u forcefield.  u play maul strikes.  u swing twice.  u play u r beaten, the other maul strikes to duel or dark strike. he craps his pants.  game by 30 plus.


 HB flip

  I hate this matchup.  S&D will hurt them, and u have decent enough space.  if he puts something on the ground, kill it. make him pay for drains.  don’t go to space until he flips.  Hard to play, but not unwinnable.  The lateral damage should help.


 The pile

  u win.  the elis allows u to kill shmi in a very bloody battle.  if not, u can beat the crap out of his guys, b/c he will almost always throw luke at u, or qui to maul.  u should win.

 Throne Room

  if they play revo’s, u r screwed.  if not, trash his guys.  goo nee tay sux, but is not that big of a deal.  i have u now and maul strikes will win u this game.


 MWHL flip

  put on the pressure quick.  make him want to come fight before he flips, them make him regret it.  S&D will really help.  so will chybc shield when he flips.  should be easy, but i have not tested it.


Anything else should be close to one of the decks listed, and u should be able to handle it. Try the deck and have a blast.  If I missed something, or u don’t get something, then d-mail me. '
