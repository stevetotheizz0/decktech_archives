Strategy: '

1st turn-	You should have drawn a Lift Tube Escape or 2. Use Strike
Planning to pull General Calrissian.Pull a Lift Tube from reserve with LTE.
Deploy a DB with Insurrection. Also deploy Cloud City from reserve with
the objective. If you have any pilots use Squad Assignments and take over
Cloud City.

2nd turn- Same as last turn except flip your objective if possible. Get
Puccimir Thryss and DODNT/WA out ASAP. Also get out the Admirals
Order. If everything is done right you can drain for 12 with 4 sites. Drain of
3 a site and because of the objective my drains are uncancelable and can
not be modified. Rops and ISB can&#8217;t minus my drains now.

If they ever try and battle just use Lift Tube Escape to get away.

Now for the matchups-

JP- This includes MKOS and Court. Just stay on CC and drain drain drain
along with running around. Never ever get caught. This can be hard or
easy. It all depends on how you play.

Hunt Down- Same as JP

BHBM- Give them Luke. Drain drain drain.

ISB- Drain Drain Drain, Run Away

RalOps- Drain Drain Drain, Run Away

If you play smart you can get your drains going in 2 turns and flip in 1. Just
play smart and you should win.
