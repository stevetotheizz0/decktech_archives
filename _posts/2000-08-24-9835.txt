Strategy: 

The strat is relatively simple. Just start pulling out DBs (DS2 DB first, the other 1/0 DBs next unless it becomes strategically advantageous to get endor DB early) for sweet activation. If it appears they are gonna stay mainly with space, just drop guys with sabers and Emperor/Sim Aloo to the Endor DB/Back Door for some nice drains. Then send up your ships to take care of some of their space squads. If they stay on the ground, lure them to you and then drop a beatdown.

This deck doesnt really intend to go for the auto-win, or flip at all for that matter, but if you think you can pull it off (and it's quite possible) you should go for it. I just don't like wasting both the Emperor AND Vader at the Throne Room. If he forfeits Luke to you, just Elis Vader away. Luke goes to their used pile or he escapes to the light side. If he chooses to escape, just Always Thinking With Your Stomach him away next turn.

Have fun. D-mail me any Q's.
