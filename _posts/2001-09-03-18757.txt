Strategy: 

 I was over at a friends house and we made up this deck so I decided to post it.  Enjoy!

Starting:
The AC is your starting location, Use Podrace Prep to put out Boonta Eve, Your Racer, and the podrace arena.

First Turn:
 Your hand should have a Kabe and some fans, and some other random interrupts.  If you don’t have a kabe, use one of your Narshada Wind chimes to pull him or an extra fan.  Deploy Kabe, and two fans to the AC on your first or second turn the latest  (Force generation is low so you might have to wait another turn to deploy.  Right Away you need to pull bo Shuda from reserve, or deploy it from hand or you risk an early beatdown.  You Don’t want to battle at the AC.

Midgame:
The average destiny in this deck is about 5, so the podrace will be a breaze.  I added in some podrace interrupts to bring up destiny and in case I come up against a dedicated dark podrace deck.  You should have Bargaining Table out by now, either by drawing it or using The Signal.  Stack a lot of Fans there to cancel forcedrains.  Keep playing  Anger, Fear, Aggression because with Bo Shuda down  they have no where to battle you!  Each Time Anger Fear Aggresion comes to the top thats four force lost.  They will lose up to another 8 force When one of your Never Tell Me The Odds comes to the top (Kabe is destiny 3, Chadra is destiny 4.  Two chadras and kabe at the AC= 3+4+4 =11 to their three or four.). Use surprise assault (average destiny in deck is 5) to cancel another drain and do some massive damage as well.  on the third fourth or fifth turn you should have won the race (Your average destiny a turn should be around ten or nine so three turns in most cases unless they are playing podrace also.)  retreive  your 6 and play I Did It to really tick them off.  If you don’t finish them off quickly (i.e. they have lots of retrieval or have out “you cannot hide forever” etc to stop your numbers),  take all the Fans that are stacked on the Baraining table for a one turn beatdown  (works well if the opponent has spread out to drain like a fool).  If you really need it play Narshada Wind chimes to retrieve a bunch to boost differential and such.  I put in the R2 in ship to boost destiny, but he can be substituted with any other destiny 7 card.  This is not a battling deck.  It is only deploy three characters to the AC, win the podrace, kill them with inserts and surprise assault.  is it cheasy?!?!?! of course it is.  It must be cheasy if their are thirteen chadra fans in it.  The way I see it it is a cool deck with no objective that would just freak a bunch of people out at a tournament.  If you love it give it a good rating, if you hate it don’t rate it at all!

~~~~Added Section~~~~~~~
Match Ups:

Quick Deal/Dark Deal - This deck would own a quick deal.  I cancel with the bargaining table.  numbers wrecks them, Anger Fear Aggresion for 4 since they cant fight me.  And the coup de grace is Surprise Assault.  Most deal decks use low power characters (especially quick deal) and with an average destiny of 5, they get wrecks.  They force drain with three power two characters, thats a total of 6 to my 15 (3 destinies of 5) = they lose 9 for a forcedrain.  it would be foolish to try to drain.

Tie decks-  Surprise Assault wrecks this also.  Retrieve with Nar Shada, get the 12 differential with the podrace.  Just play smart and soncervatie it should be simple.

Mains-  Mains is a little harder.  high power characters makes Surprise Assault a risk.  These decks usually have low destiny, so the podrace will be a cinch.  Number will take this down cause they will have three and I will have 11 so they lose 10 force and again Anger Fear Aggresion will do 4 every time it pops since they can’t battle.

Senate- This is probably the toughest matchup since i won’t be able to pop Surprise Assault, and the Senators tend to be high destiny.  it doesn’t matter tho cause many Senate decks seem to have Maul and some other destinies ones to make Never Tell Me the Odds do 10, plus the 12 differential from the podrace, plus Anger Fear Aggresion for 4 every time it.

Watto Deck-  Yeah the objective is annoying, just save the force and pay for their card, they won’t be able to battle you (haha I can play Anger Fear Aggresion for 4 a pop).  Numbers will take them down, the podrace will be easily won, and Surprise assault will do massive damage if they have low power characters.  Oh yeah, And Nar Shada for huge retrieval!!!

You Cannot Hide Forever-  This is a semi common card to find in decks.  would it cause me problems?  Hell yes!  Am I worried?  No way.  With surprise assault, Nar shada retrieval, Anger Fear Aggresion, and Podrace retrieval/damage I have other ways to destroy my opponent.  Don’t give me a ”You Cannot Hide Forever would own you” comment since there are so many other ways to beat them down.  Anyways, thanks for reading and rate fairly!
