Strategy: 

this is retieving engine. it captures and uses sabacs to destroy destinys. watto’s gets back with sith probe droids when ever wattos gets whacked. it need sac protection.

first turn deploy wato to junk yard. grab and deploy bib to next site and flip. hit them for two. move bib to wato’s site. reflip then
second turn deploy bounty hunter to mos espe and hit them for two again. move the guy to junk yard. and so on

HB-echo base flipped:
get out search and destory in the first turn by YCHF and hit them for three. watos objective and search and destroy. grab jabbas cruiser and hutts influence and drain. 

senate deck:

Battle like hell and drain them out. Go after them. captured them.

WYS:
THis is fun. They have few characters that is hard to get power so they need to get destinies. Put guri at the cantina and make them suffer. 

Profit:
Load up on the audience chamber and capture them. Its going to be along game....

there is good in him:
this is tough battling game. Capture luke and watch for mass drops. keep ghkk ready

This is a thinking mans deck. It has everything it needs to win. Capturing jedis and use the forfeit to take them out. It wil drain in time. It is a nice deck with tropper sabacc.
i know it needs more watos and sac protection and even jabba but it does fine without it
