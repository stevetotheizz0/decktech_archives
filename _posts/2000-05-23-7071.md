Strategy: '

Start Death Star, Twilek for an effect depending on your opponent's start, and beat them down.

This deck absolutely hammers Throne Room, since it simply has too much power.

If in doubt about what to start, Crush Da Rebellion is good.

Your drains in space will finish off the LS, and will allow you to beat them down if they try to landing claw you (TRWEU).

Track destinies with Reactor Terminal '
