Strategy: '

PLEASE READ ALL OF THE STRATEGY BEFORE REVIEWING

Ok.  By starting with MWYHL, you get instant Sense and Alter protection.  Then, with Insurrection, you can pull the two docking bays from your reserve deck.  The Dagobah sites, are good activation.  Try to get some of the droids out, and start running inserts ASAP.  Play Death Star Plans, as many times as possible.  The Enhanced Characters are for quick beatdowns.	You can always retreive them later. Use the Hologameboard, and the two Projections for a loss of 2, every turn.  The Recoil In Fears, are for making sure the Inserts come up.	Well, good luck.

By the way.  I was thinking about adding a couple Don't Forget The Droids (the Lost part, your crackheads).  Does anyone think I should?  '
