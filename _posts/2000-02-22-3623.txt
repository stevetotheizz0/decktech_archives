OBJECTIVE

Alright, the main focus of this deck is a slow and painful death for your opponent. Quite a few cards to reduce damage done to you / avoid battles, allowing you to spread the mains some for maximum benefit from the flip.

PLAYING THE DECK
STARTING

Start with General Solo for the increased protection and immunity to Bubo. Use a Signal for Insurrection to protect from teleporting Vaders and provide a little extra force early on.

EARLY GAME

Use Insurrection to get out the Hoth DB before the Tatooine one if possible; that extra 1 force over the opponent can come in handy.
You can free the Hansicle in two ways; get Leia to the AC and play Someone Who Loves You, or just beat the living daylights out of the AC guards. The first method is simpler and quicker, but the second is much more satisfying.
I usually only assault the AC when they have a weak defensive force; I prefer to have Luke or Chewie waiting outside and free Han via Leia. The advantage there is that you still block the DS drain at the Audience Chamber, and Han has decent defense against a beatdown.

MID-GAME

Once Han's free, concentrate on getting him and a Profit buddy (Luke, Leia w/ cover broken, Chewie) to either the Cantina or Mos Eisley. Once you've done that, you have a major mobility advantage over the opponent, since they have to walk over the Docking Bay to get to you on the other side. Also, there's a trick you can with the Cantina Shuffle During your control phase, first use ME's LS text to move Han or his Profit buddy to the other site. Next, drain and make the opponent lose to the objective. Then finish the ME movement, fully protecting Han again. Neat, huh?
If the opponent drops Bottle Plan, you have 3 options you can (a) drop Roche and a ship (if you don't fear a space beatdown), (b) Landing Claw an opponent's ship and detach during your turn, or (c) concentrate at only a couple sites and pay to drain. Option (a) is riskiest, but nets you a drain if you can pull it off. Also, don't worry if the opponent takes over Roche; they can't drain there.

END GAME

Hopefully your multi-Visage effect will have taken its toll on the DS. If at some point they manage to off Han, use Someone Who Loves You to put him in the Used Pile. Alternatively, you could keep Ben with him for revival or use Bacta Tank, though the Tank's expensive with the General.

SPECIFIC CARD USAGE

Narrow Escape If you only have a few characters at a site, provides a realatively painless method of escape. Also, if used at a docking bay, you can DB Transit everyone for just 1 force

Fallen Portal A nasty surprise (or not so surprise) for someone who picks a fight at JP or either of the Docking Bays. Usually is best to target only 1 character unless you are tracking destiny.

Eject Eject Helps even out space a little by getting rid of the nasty BH pilots. Note that a ship cannot use any of its text if unpiloted.

Harc Seff Handy little permanent Could Be Worse. Plop him and some guards between 2 DS drains, and watch the opponent get really irritated.

SPECIFIC DECK STRATEGIES

against Hunt Down **One thing people fail to realise Once you flip, you can really care less about Visage with this deck. You have your own multi-Visage going and you can keep Luke and Obi at battlegrounds, making the DS lose to Visage as well. As long as they lose to Visage also, IT DOESN"T MATTER IF YOU DO. You have the advantage in long term damage over them.**
 If you can get them to commit Vader early, you stand a good chance of winning. The 2-3 force a turn from your objective combined with the seriously reduced / canceled drains from your undercover spies and drains reducers will wear them down amazingly fast. If they use dueling, don't be afraid to use Luke or Obi, just be a bit more cautious. It's fun to make Vader chase a shuffling Luke or Obi.

against Space chances are they won't have a strong ground force, so you might be able to spread out some more. When using Landing Claw, be careful of Homing Beacon (to cancel it) or Kiss a Wookie ?(to leave your ship stranded w/o a Claw). It's usually best to simply eat the space drains and work heavily on your turf.

against Ops Get Harc Seff to the Occupied world with backup ASAP. He'll do you a world of good. Also, A Gift ruins ops.

against CotVG protect those mains, especially Han. You REALLY don't want him going out of play. The upshot is, if they capture Han, Leia can free him using Someone Who Loves You ;-)

against #'s haven't seen any numbers in a while, so this is speculation. They likely won't deploy anything to the AC at start, so set up your drains on Tat and free Han after losing a couple force. Spread out all across the planet and stop activating afer they've inserted. The damage from the Objective will seriously hurt them.	'
