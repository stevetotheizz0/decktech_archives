Strategy: 

Start with IAO to get docking bays against everything but ops.  Against Ops
start with Battle Order.  Get Vader out as soon as possible to the Operative planet or to the East Platform.
After that let the 3 visages work on them.  Get Reactor Terminal out as soon as possible and recycle the high destinies and track them.
Use Vaders to beat down the opponent but save an EPP Vader to duel.  Use the others for the main battling.  The other characters are for support.
With the Counter Assaults, a large loss from a wieny drain should cause a 15+ force loss at least.  Use
this force loss to your advantage.  The Duels can turn the game into your favor also.
Don't forget that late game Vader's Obsession can be used to retrieve force if you can do it with
the tracked destinies.

Be patient with the Counter Assaults.  Let one drain go through before you cause the heavy damage so you can track.

Good Luck!
