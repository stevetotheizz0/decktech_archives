Strategy: '

I did forget the keyy cards take out an its a trap and 2 don't forget the driods and a landing claw and add in 4x Organized Attack.

This deck is pretty simple.

First you use the objecive on ralltiir then pull out the farm and use the signal to pull out yarna d'al' Gargan(to bo safe)or bargaining table/rebel fleet(don't use rebel fleet unless you want to give away the deck and not leave it for a suprise. I do not worry about the death star obective blowing up the planet because oe the space in the deck. Draw up the first turn and wait for the one turn flip. Deploy 3 opps to the sites and the y-wings to the system then land the ships but make sure to keep an its a trap in hand and 4 force saved(4 in case they play first strike). The cool thing is that if you have all the sites out you will probably draw a 3 for destiny.

And a bonus for using ralltiir your ships move their as a react so when you have enough ships on the ground go ahead and deploy a couple of ships in space and make sure to save force.

Be sure to use the retrival when you are dying. Dont be to happy about space battles because alternatives to figting is not immune to sense

Another Thing I would Like to give props to Kris Lavinge and his brother Jeff For helping me build this deck. And to the rest of you guys representing Las Vegas(We will when regionals)  '
