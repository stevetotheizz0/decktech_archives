Strategy: '

Well, here’s a plain ol’ ROPS deck.  Deploy Forest first, then the other 2 on both sides of it.  Use holonet transmission to fetch the Emperor out of your used pile.  Lose YCHF to get Overseeing It Personally.  Place Expand The Empire on the Forest and Mosep there.  Try to get WIAPN out and deploy Chimaera w/ Thrawn and Pallaeon to Ralltiir.  Get General Veers and Tagge to the sites, and Igar, with Igar and Veers in their respective vehicles.  Use SHUOSHD to get rid of that pesky Bacta Tank and How Did We Get Into This Mess?  and the sometimes used DS Plans.  Use overseeing it personally and mosep to drain them lots from reserve deck.  Get janus to Emp’s site to beef it up.  Make them lose 3 force from the generals and commanders at the sites.  Beatdown their biggest drain place.  You rule. '
