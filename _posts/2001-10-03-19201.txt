Strategy: 

This deck is very simple to play, like other big blue decks. The huge advantage to other big blue decks is that no card costs more than 5 to deploy.

Drain at the docking bays for two (with your admirals order), let the occupation doing damage and defend your system with the sabers.

First deploy to space and hold your system. Then deploy the atst`s to your docking bays. With the occupation, the admirals order and the docking bays you will damage your opponent for 10 each turn.


Take it easy,
