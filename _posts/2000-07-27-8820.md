Strategy: '

First off in your review, do you see a card I can take out to add Aim High?

Stay Sharp is a Sorry About The Mess for space, or adds a weapon's destiny # to power if you just fired it. Just so you know why it is there.

Yoor Insight is for Honor or Insurrection. Whatever you feel wil help more.

Ok. First turn deploy Aquaris. Count up your opponent's activation and if you feel safe deploy a ship there preferably via Squadron Assignments. Next System you deploy should be Chandrila and try to get a capital ship there as soon as possible.
Your generation will now be 10 assuming they have no one at Aquaris and give you no icons. Make sure you keep 1 weapon at every system. Rapid Fire will bring up weapons for battle too which is awesome coz the Frigates can fire X-wing cannons. Roche and the sooner you can get Slayn & Korpil out the better. From then on Space is your playground. Blue Squadron 5 with Ten Numb and an intruder missile under the appropriate circumstances and with interrupts can shoot the Executor with a draw of 2. Rops might be a problem, but I haven't lost to it so far.

Please send me a message if you have any questions.

Old Wedge is in the coz I haven't got the new one or his ship yet. I recommend switching them out if you do have them.
