Strategy: '

The main idea is to get obi+sabre to the tosche station.
Chances of a first turn of this actually aren't that bad,
and happens in probably a little less than half of my games.
This gives you a force advantage while pinging them for 2 every turn,
unless they come to fight.  All the better, luke + obi
combined with the put that downs and blaster deflections
make if VERY hard to kick them out of the station.

If they don't come to you, go to them.  Pick a spot,
deploy 2-3 guys, a destiny adder, high destinies+shots
combined with put that down makes for a hard time for the
dark side.  Or let them come to you.. drop Han, don't
battle.  When they battle you, life debt for chewie,
I know for leia, then play protector.  Yes it's card intensive,
but i've done it so many times it's worth mentioning.

Sense there reacts and interrupts, but use them
somewhat sparingly, as with only 4, you'll find you'll
run through them quite quickly.

Biggest problem this deck faces is a good dark side space...
which i have yet to test it against.  A good walker deck
with IAO can hurt too. '
