Strategy: 

    The main idea of this deck is to use Twelik advisor to deploy well guarded so they don’t beep you over and make you lose your 35 storm troopers.

Deploy a Vader and a comlink on him.  Then you can react by deploying a crap load of storm troopers.

Use The empires back to get out vader
