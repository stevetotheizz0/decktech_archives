Response to Reviews-

Luca- In Ep.1, the undercover spy rules were modified. Even is Keder is there, you can still initiate the force drain (which means they stack a card) and then Keder cancels the drain. Only in Episode 1. 

End

########



This is what Ive come up with for Ep.1 Closed Environment Tournaments. I want the

enhanced Maul. Remember, this is EPISODE 1 ONLY.



Strategy

With 27 characters, you should always have 2-3 in your opening hand. If Qui-Gon isn’t in

your hand, pull him out first turn with City Outskirts. You should be able to hold 3 sites,

and set up Secure Route, which IMO is broken. The Galactic Senate is thrown in there so

I can drop Valorum, Sei, Mas, and all of the other non-senators with politics. They do

some nifty things. By the time you flip you should have drawn the QRS and Ric Ollie.

They are good. They can beat almost anything in space, and they stay alive. It’s basically

just a battle deck which can kick @#$% if need be. 


Match-ups

NM, NP, ND Easy win. This deck was made for you to beat Watto. First and probably

most important, you convert their Junkyard. This means they have to draw for Watto.

Usually by the time they draw one, Qui-gon will be firmly in place. Next, this deck has the

staying power with over 20 characters. They just keep coming and coming and coming.


MLITL? This is the deck to beat in Episode 1. Podracing or not, this deck is trouble. You

should be able to take over the senate, with the help of the interrupts and such. Make sure

you grab Squabbling Delegates. Just play your game and set up at the Junkyard to do your

normal damage. Ric Olie in ship will take care of any space they have, and give you at

least a nice space drain at Tatooine. The steady retrieval of Yaura (if you can set up space)

or Amidala (if theyre running Naboo sites) really helps because of the lack of Might of the

Republic. This is winnable. 




Card choices


-No Might of the Republic? One simple reason, dont have it. Im hoping to get at least one

before my first Ep.1 tournament. 

-Non-senators with politics? Against a Watto deck, they sit in the Senate and do their

thing.

-2 Ric Olie/Queens Ship? They are really really good, especially combined with Palpy or

Valorum in the Senate.


The deck is undefeated in playtesting, even without Might of the Republic. And

remember, this is an EPISODE 1 ONLY deck, so review accordingly.  '
