Strategy: '

How to play versus 

 - Hidden Base  start Imperial Square and  Imperial Arrest Order. You get a Docking Bay for each planet they throw out and you can throw an ISB there to increase the drain. There is 5 ships if you wanna probe , note that since you'll be on multiple planets draining for an insane amount of force you don't really need to probe ( I'm also taking into account they are really tech and are guarding Dagobah with like an insane amount of X-Wings or something.

   - Mains and Toys - Spread out , Ghhhk , Don't draw destiny and Imperial Arrest Order will shaft them.

   - Ops - ABC2theuni , 5d6. Note that if they leave them selves open you can Sunsdown their planet and crush something that is alone.

   - Yavin 4 w/ and w/o Revos  Um 5 copies of Tatooine will basically guarentee you a copy. You can start with Imperial Arrest Order or Oppressive Enforcement in this situation. Imperial Supply will help v. Choke and you don't really need force.

That's basically all the good LS decks I can think of. You have MASSIVE regen and the deck is good all around. Grimtaash doesn't hurt as much as you think as everything is going on the table ASAP. Good luck.'
