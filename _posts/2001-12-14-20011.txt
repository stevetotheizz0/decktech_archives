Strategy: '

The deck works pretty smoothly. Key thing is to remember which Senators do what, and when to use them, and how to use them. 

For example, EVERY turn use Yeb Yeb. He is possibly the second best Senator. What he does is simple, he looks at the opponent&#8217;s top card, you can either replace it, or lose a force and the opponent loses a force. 

And Speaking of Lotti Doddi.... 
Back to the Senators.... 

Lott Dodd is the best Senator EVER. He is a Tunnel Vision every turn. Almost ALWAYS use him, the deck can activate a good amount of force, so you are destinied to get something good each time you use him, if you don&#8217;t get anything good, you always have the possibility of getting a The Point is Conceded, which allows you to activate a force {replacing the one you just drew}, then track it and use that 6 for good purposes. Lotti Doddi can be used in so many situations, hes great. 

Orn Free Ta is a great senator, for the fact that he deploys for 1, and though his game text is slightly limited, still useful. If you just drew the Emperor, and need him, take him into hand, or if you just drew the ONE ZERO in the deck {the Naboo site} then take it into hand, so you don&#8217;t have that zero floating around anymore. Also, the ability to use X force, where X equals the number of cards in opponent&#8217;s force pile during there deploy phase to take him back into hand is extremely versatile as well. If they save the one force to battle, and you fear a beat-down, at the very end of their deploy phase, use 1 force, {they must use 1 force}, and he goes back into hand, and then you can just deploy him next turn for 1 force. 

Aks Moe is a decent senator. 
Baskol is also good when you late game drop the Naboo Generator, and a roody-poo character there, she allows you to deal one additional damage. 

The Unsalvageable is decent, its a good way to cancel Out of Commission, and once I add the Starships in my next version, a good way to protect them from Power Pivot. 

I wish I had more Coruscant Mauls, but since I have none, I will do with the 3 Tatooine Mauls. 

As you can probably tell this first started out as an Episode 1 Deck, as it slightly leans towards the EP1 portion of SW rather then the normal Universe. 

Squabbling Delegates lets you go get a Senator {usually will be Lott Dodd unless you have him}. 

How your first turns should "progress"

*Turn 1 Hope to draw a Senator with Blockade {hopefully Lotti Doddi} or a Squabbling Delegates. If you draw the Delegates go grab one of the 3 Dodds. Then hopefully either drop Orn Free or Yeb Yeb. Then search for a Political Effect.

*Turn 2 Use Yeb Yeb if you deployed him. Use Lotti Doddi if you deployed him to check your force pile. If your able to, make em drop 2 random cards. Then, search for a Political Effect. Save alot of force.

*Turn 3 Yeb Yeb and Lotti Doddi again. If able to, use the obj. to drop 2 from their hand. Now you should be set to attempt to deliver a beat-down, and the opponent should have dropped something by now.

*Turn 4 Commence beatdown. First use Lotti Doddi to get another key card. Use Yeb Yeb to make sure they get no good destiny. Then if able to, make em drop 2. Then commence the beat down.

The deck basically runs that simply.

Ummm.... this deck did just recently beat Drew Scott&#8217;s Profit deck that went undefeated at Worlds, so the deck is decent.
