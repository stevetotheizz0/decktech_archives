Strategy: 

Use the Docking bays for LOTS fo force for you, and none for them. Use myoom onith and Kill all thier unique Males. Then Monnok the doubles or lower them to 8 cards. Beatdown whoever they manage tog et out, and force drain in space. You may have trouble against Hidden Base, but try to kill of unique pilots at least. Have fun with this one.
