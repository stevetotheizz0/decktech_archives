Strategy: 

A pretty straight-forward Jedi testing deck. We all know the trick to testing, so I won't go into that (obviously use Insight to get The Way Of Things).

Vs. Any DS Space Deck-
Get your mains with their special effects onto the Home One and just do a beatdown. With Jedi Test 4, It isn't hard to get the effects out. (plus using I Wonder Who They Found).

Vs. Any Ground Deck-
Use your mains for an easy beatdown then drain them to death wwith your lightsabers.
