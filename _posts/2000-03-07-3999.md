Strategy: '

Rather than going for an insane number of destiny draws, this deck knocks out carachters with weapons.

Usual starting effect is Scrambled Transmission. Pull Dag/Hut first turn. Search for Shockers to see what's active. Tunnel as needed.

This deck is played like most mains decks. Not a real elaborate strategy. Still, some of the cards are not terribly common in mains decks, and supply the element of surprise.

Drain potential is pretty good with Pucimer. Celebration and Off the Edge allow for some modest retrieval. I'll spare you the description of how to play this vs. specific deck types, as it should be pretty obvious.
