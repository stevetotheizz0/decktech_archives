UPDATES Some people think this deck is
meant to battle in space. This is not true
You just drain and complete the Runs If
you’re caught in a battle just forfeit ships
to satisfy. Also the Kessel Runs are staying
in. They’re an advantage over most decks
like BHBM in the sense they can retrieve
a lot and with my design they do work.
The activation problems you see (which
I assure you didn’t exist in the first place)
have been fixed below in my previous
update. Also I’ve been told going from a
docking bay to a system with a ship is free.
Now I can get both the Outrider, Red 10
and Pulsar Skate free with a <>Docking
Bay, and my YT-1300s and Millenium
Falcon -1. If the above information is true
please LMK if I haven’t corrected it myself
after looking it up.

Previous UPDATE Switch Ultimatum with
Menace Fades Drop Retort for another OOC/TT.
Also Secret Plans may seem like a problem but
I assure you it is not. I havent had a problem with
it yet, but just to be sure Ill switch Captive Pursuit
for Staging Areas and start with it in place of
Menace Fades. Talon and some scrubsll just
have to free Han en route to the AC the old
fashioned way. This should streamline the
deck and fix some bugs you guysll find.

Now what you do with this deck is setup docking
bay drains with Ill Take The Leader, while Kessel
Running to makeup for any losses youll take from
opponents drains and battles. Staging Areas sounds
good in this deck but I get along great without it.
The <> Docking Bays make my freighters deploy -2
so I deploy ships at them and move em up to the
system, for a real reduction of 1. This is
important since activation is usually low in decks
like this. I find its sufficient with this
 reduction combined with the mostly low deploy
characters of the deck.

Battle Plan gets bumped off the table by the
extra Ill Take The Leader, Imp. Command is only
really useful in space so its not a problem. Guri
is a bit of a bug but if the opponent deploys her
theyll likely be fighting with her so target her
first. Dont worry about the Cantina too much. If
its really getting bad use the Brawl to take out
as many characters as possible then recapture it
for your own drain use.

If you lose a ship itll either be retrieved or
go to a docking bay with the AO. If your opponent
beatdowns your lone character, Noble Sac. him if
possible. Otherwise use that card as you see fit.
The Kessel Runs in this deck always take 2 turns
to complete and retrieve 10 force if using RFCS.
Ive gotten 25-40 card wins with all the retrieval
so Im keeping it in The objective flips fast so
SAC is not a problem.

Against BHBM and Huntdown just take down Vader
using whatever you have. Even 2 RFCs can take
out Vader with minimal losses with the high
destiny of this deck. Once it flips thisll be
even easier. Scum can be handled with moderate
success with the retrieval and space drains.

Reasons why cards are in this deck
Red 10 This card adds one destiny to power, not
one battle destiny, so its immune to Imp. Command
and other such cards.

Insertion Planning RFCs and both Lukes are scouts
so why not take advantage of this with a used 6
destiny interrupt that reduces the opponents
battle destiny?

Hope you like this deck. Please tell me what to
add/take out in your review.
