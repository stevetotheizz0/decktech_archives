STRATEGY
the main startegy of this deck is to get your ebo up by turn 2 or 3 and lay an x wing to each system.  they will try to give you a beat down because you are so vunerable, but if they deploy a few isd’s, just hyper escape away.  after you run away.  deploy your other x-wings in your hand and a mon cal or two to go back and retake the system, then balance out again and continue.

this is how i usually start.  first, before you activate, search through your deck and take echo base garrison, and the war room(if you got the war room in opening hand take a different site).  then activate and deploy them.  one you deploy them, take one of your characters with the garrison, if they are playing hunt down or bhbm, take commander luke until you get your jedi. if you got another character in your opening hand(i.e. epp or jpsd) lay it to the north ridge along with commander luke as soon aspossible.  next turn take your other two sites and a character like hobbie, and the turn after ebo. after you get ebo on table, start taking your systems and dropping a wing to each of them.  and as i went over before, just hyper escape away from fleets.  when i play this deck, i dont put a single mon cal or another x-wing to a system until they make their first attack unless i dont have any hyper escapes in hand.  drain until they make the first move, then run away and come back with greater numbers(i.e. mon cals and x wing swarms) to take your draining system back.

MATCHUPS

hunt down in my opinion, this is the hardest matchup just because hunt down is such a great deck(its the dark i run at tournaments).  generally hunt downs dont run much space so you can give them a beatdown if they try to take it from you.  also, draw every now and then to get your jedi luke, but in the meantime, keep your commander well gaurded so vader thinks twice before epic dueling you(because he would have to face the after effects of your remaining force).  but take the commander out and deploy him with an epp or somthin right away. same applies to your epp obi about gaurding him, but he is a little better cause of his ability 6 and a lightsaber.

BHBM this deck is not popular in my area so i dont know too much about it.  but, try to gather your land force in your hand so when they deploy vader, you can come down to him and get him off the table.  the BHBM’s i know of are like the hunt downs i know of, they dont run too much space so you can drain them to death and give them beatdowns.  i would give my jedi luke(deploy from deck -2) to vader if i didnt have much land, but when you do, keep all your starships and characters in groups as to make sure not to lose a single battle, if you dont, their objective will hhurt themselves cause they cant turn luke without stacking at least 3 cards on insignifigant rebellion.  very easy if you make sure you dont lose your battles, which you can do by concentrating your ground forces and giving out beatdowns in space.

MKOS this deck is a good matchup cause it will most certainly be running hutt influence which will not let you stop a drain with rebel fleet, and their drains can get quite hefty.  put a group of 3 or 4 mains down to tantoonie and your combo’s of leia with han, han with luke, lando on tatoonie will kill them with your many draws, and also, jabba’s palace aliens are low ability so you can chop them and exclude them and shoot them easily.  also, like the above two decks, the MKOS’s i have run into dont run too much space, so the same applies, drain them and make them lose key cards, and if they dare put a hunk of junk in space, blow it away.  against this deck, it is imperative that you go to tatoonie and cut them down to size, literally.

COTVG in this deck you can bet they will be playing independent starships, but they are allowed only to deploy 1 at a time, so they generally cant give you beatdowns.  play your strategy normally with one change.  leave only 1-2 people to gaurd hoth(not lando, he’s broken on tatoonie), and deploy the rest to one tattoonie site and camp out so you dont have to lose 1 force for their objective.  easy game.

ROpsno one plays this by me anymore, cause it just doesnt work anymore with the new cards that have come out.	but just in case somone plays it by you, the few that i have seen do play space, so do your normal strategy and lay a wing at each system, and hyper escape away and come back with a beatdown.  you should kill them with the drains.	drop on group of mains to ralltiir and creat havoc.

endor opsmostly all endor ops these days are space with the drain +2 with ominous rumors.  some consider it the weak counterpart to ebo, but i dont even put them in the same sentence.  most of them play only enough land to get their sites for ominous rumors, so drop a group of mains to endor and beat them to dust so they dont get their drain bonus’.	since it is a space deck, they will play a good number of systems, which for ebo means, more draining.	i concentrate on my own systems, but who can resist a weakly gaurded system, go kick them out of space, and with minimul land you already killed, what are they going to do, the answer, watch you count how much you won by.

SYCFA tiesyou wont believe me but, i have only played a SYCFA ties deck once, and it was a fun game not tournament, it is so un-popular by me.  but i think i can manage a matchup.  try to give them an early beat down before they can play their all powers to weapons’.  and try to battle them when they have little force so they can shoot your wings out of the battle with those special edition tie cannons.  also, take control of their bays with your mains so they dont get a ton of avtivation, and they dont have enough to deploy a fleet per turn.  and try to get your draining up fast so they lose key cards such as those all powers to weapons and others.  not incredibly hard.

that is all the matchups i can think of, but if i missed one you would like to know about, send me a message.  and to tj holman, that description about the deck where i said piles was not talking about your ebghetto, i think it is a good deck, i was talking about other top rank players who could post a terrible carbon freezing deck and get 5 stars cause of their rank.  anywase, hope you like the deck and try it out, cause it does work.
