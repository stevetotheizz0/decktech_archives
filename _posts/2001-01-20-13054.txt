Strategy: '

It doesn’t really matter who your rep is, as long a it’s one of the Jawas, I only have one copy of each

Get Boshuda out and then deploy Kalit, Tessek, and Aved Luun to the Audiance Chamber.  Don’t start deploying Jawas until you get all of them down and a couple of Siestas.  Deploy any of the three if you have any of them or use YWTMTJN to get them out of the reserve deck.

Here’s a couple card explanations

Kalit-All your Jawas are power +2 and Siesta is non-unique and doubled

Tessek-Your force drains are +1, and your Jawas deploy for free

Aved Luun-You can search your reserve deck for a Jawa or a Utinni, if you have more than Jawas on table, Utinni can be played to cancel a force drain

Noble Sacrifice-With all your Siestas on the table your Jawas are forfeit 12

Sandwhirl-If they’re stupid enough to deploy characters to a desert

Nar Shadda-I usually don’t use it to pull Jawas, unless I have two on my hand, since Aved Luun can do that

On Tessek’s game text it says non-unique aliens deploy -1, a ruling on Jawas says that if their deploy cost is reduced it’s reduced to zero, that’s why I don’t have the Jawa Camp in here.
