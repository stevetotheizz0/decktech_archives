Strategy: '

1st turn-	You should have drawn a Lift Tube Escape or 2. Use Strike

Planning to pull General Calrissian.Pull a Lift Tube from reserve with LTE.

Deploy a DB with Insurrection. Also deploy Cloud City from reserve with

the objective. If you have any pilots use Squad Assignments and take over

Cloud City.


2nd turn- Same as last turn except flip your objective if possible. Get

Puccimir Thryss and DODNT/WA out ASAP. Also get out the Admirals

Order. If everything is done right you can drain for 12 with 4 sites. Drain of

3 a site and because of the objective my drains are uncancelable and can

not be modified. Rops and ISB can&#8217;t minus my drains now.


If they ever try and battle just use Lift Tube Escape to get away.


Now for the matchups-


JP- This includes MKOS and Court. Just stay on CC and drain drain drain

along with running around. Never ever get caught. This can be hard or

easy. It all depends on how you play.


Hunt Down- Same as JP


BHBM- Give them Luke. Drain drain drain.


ISB- Drain Drain Drain, Run Away


RalOps- Drain Drain Drain, Run Away


If you play smart you can get your drains going in 2 turns and flip in 1. Just

play smart and you should win.
