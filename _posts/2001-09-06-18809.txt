Strategy: 

Okay.  Everything should be sorta selfexplanatory (sp??).  

Locations-Tat system for the Tat. Occupation (got that idea from the other Watto deck in the top 10).  Use Neimoidian Advisor to get out your Jabba’s Palace, then use that to pull the Chamber.  Use Power Of The Hutt to get Jabba’s Sail Barge (it’s a TANK!) and the passenger deck.  The docking bay is there so you can move around a little and not be locked at Tat. 

Characters-Basically just deploy characters and lock locations.  Guri beats WYS and you can hold the Audience Chamber against Profit with Boelo and Ephant Mon.  I don’t feel Hidden Base cause of my air patrol, but you may want to through in a Hutt Influence to character your drains don’t get beaten/canceled.  Thrawn is badass in the Dag. Executor (which your obj can get you to deploy for free.

Vehicles-Your Sail Barge and AtAt’s become TANKS!  Especially with Trample.  You should own space, but look out for Power Pivot.  

Interrupts-You Are Beaten is gay, but wins games.  TwiLeks for the effects, Neimoidians for the system and for the Jabba’s Palace.  Sniper/Dark Strike is huge.  Weapon Levs to find your sticks.   I’ve seen people using It Could Be Worse to kill the damage from the obj., slaughter them with It’s Worse if they do, since you activate SOOO much.

Effects-Blast Doors is tech against barrier cause I’ve seen people letting you deploy things for free then just barriering it, might as well stop that:)  Bad Feeling just cause.  No Escape cause you need to cancel Honor; another way of making your obj. not work.  Two grabbers to fight the dumb stuff being played now, and especially to fight against WYS - keeps the interrupts outta their lost pile.

You don’t have to play for the Tat. Occupation.  Just do it if it comes along.  Basically, own  your two locations, drain a lot and then put down Occupation if they ignore you or something.  
Enjoy,
