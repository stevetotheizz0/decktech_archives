Strategy: '

strategy 


my first profit deck without podrace and i think it’s better to concentarte all your ability to free "Han" and to

battle or give damagethe strat is very easy to understand, i start with "Insurrection & Aim High" to pull out one more

battleground and with "Fallen Portal" i wil be able to hold the bay. then it’s very simple get out 3-PO with 

"Were You Looking For Me?" and deploy "A Gift" on him, to protect yourself from fast drains and high battle dests.

"The Camp" will help you to free "Han", try as fast as possible to get out the "Jedi Council Chamber" with "Yoda" and 

"Alter" to canacel bad feeling or something elsethen go out with your mains and battle,retrieve, give damage and so on.

It’s a battle deck, and if you free "Han" with some mains and their sabers you’ll give a direct damage of 6 and higher each

turn.some beast cards that must stay in the deck are "Goo Nee Tay", "Clash Of Sabers", "Double Agent" and finally "Gift Of The Mentor"


here are some cards explanations 



-why Rebel Artillery?


to track me a dest of 7 for "On The Edge" and with Leia’s Rifle give damage



-why Double Agent?


it’s easy, to kick all the spies like, jade, arica, U-3PO or Kedar also a nice dest



-why Were You Looking For Me?


3-PO must be fast on table to track and to stop drains on tat. for example against watto



-why Seeking An Audience and Underworld Contacts?


just to convert my jabba’s palace and to get out faster 3-PO


so i think they aren’t any strange cards in this deck, so plz tell me your ideas and opinion



thx all for reading/rating this deck, and keep improving DeckTech

i’m out (probs to my h-town underground crew)
