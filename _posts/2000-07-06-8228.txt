Strategy: 

Don't mark me off because of my strategy, it is basically the same against all decks and is very simple.
I will explain some things that my be questionable.

VS most decks(land based, eg mains, PROFIT, OPS, etc...)

Get down Vader to an opponet's location(since they are so nice to usually put one out). Get down various other characters, drain, battle, and use nifty interrupts to destroy in battle. Duel with Mara and Vader, use the Vader Tarkin combo for duels and Foccussed Attack.

Profit
Start Mara + Dannik in Audience Chamber, pull her saber 1st turn, get Vader down second turn(or 1st if Vaders Obsession was in opening hand)
Draw up 1st turn to get a Vaders Obsession, since there are 4 it is easy to get. Duel Luke ASAP and make them hurt, it's very easy to win duels with these destinies.

HB
Start Presence in Chamber, put vader there flip. Use the -2 on their battle destinies, and the text of Chamber to win battles in space.
Get down those ships and S. Precautions. Deploy other characters on the ships for attrition fodder.
-Beats em every time.

EBO
Same strategy as HB minus S.precautions.
Plus, get down Mara and Walker to Hoth.

Vs most other decks
Start Crush, put down lots of characters, Elis around kill people and duel. Garrison one large squad against Rescue Princess and operatives at one site and kill them that way.

Only one location because of Presence in chamber vs space, and can deploy to opponets locations otherwise.

Sorry, I know this is lacking, but you know how it works, the only things I really needed to explain was profit start, 1 location, and the presence in chamber start.
I hope that if you are reviewing decks, then you do have some common sense on the cards.
Rate the deck, not the strategy notes.thanks a lot, God Bless.
