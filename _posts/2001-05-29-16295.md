Strategy: '

This is a force drain and beadown deck, it is very capable in space and on the ground. It controls the game. it has many characters to keeps the beatdowns going, destiny and force drain adders, etc. Track your destinies and you can cause tons of battle damage, and maybe even cross luke. 


Starting I start Imperial Arrest Order, Mobilization Points, and Crush the Rebellion. So can get tons of early activation, get my sites I need out, and get Evader combo + IHYN


Playing Pull your sites, and get the emperor to the throne room with emperors power, get your drain sites set up, but keep beatdown characters in hand. When opportunity strikes 

use your destiny adders, to cause massive attrition and battle damage, dont let them control anything. Get battle order going to stop all of their drains if you can win a few 

battles you could always cross luke for an instant win. Your Destiny will help out if they dont deploy luke, and even if they do your removing the light sides most powerful 

character in the game 


Advantages No luke dueling vader when tatooine comes out. Three ways to win Drain,Battle, or cross. Or you can try a combination of the three.The ability to control the who table. 


Matchups 


WYS this deck destroys most WYS it controls tatooine on the ground with massive destinies, and drains at the cantina. if you can take rendili, Tatooine, or Kessel and keep the ground with battle order out they dont stand a chance vs. your massive drains. You can restrict their destinies with Guri. You destroy all of WYS main advantages. Slow their retrieval with Secret Plans, and control the game. usually an easy win. 


TIGIH scouts Send huge beatdown crews to endor, choke, shoot, operate, sniper, I Have you now, etc. Drain in space and use battle order to make them pay for their drains. Wear him down with your drains, and cross luke if you can. Difficult game if you dont play smart, but can be easily won if you play smart. 


Hidden Mains Destroy his mains on the ground, and drain in space. Guri will kill the super falcon, Secret plans will slow their retrieval. Drain for tons, and you can always cross luke. Not much they can do here, pretty easy win. 


QMC Sense their run away cards, and alter celebration, use secret plans vs their retrival,

cross luke, or just drain them out. 


Anything else just control the board, drain, cross luke, battle, add destines, the possibilities are endless 


Use Your S/A package to get rid of portal, Jedi Presence, Narrow Escape, Bacta Tank, Rebel Fleet, ETC. Use monnok to seewhats in their hand, then use Uncertain is the Future to get rid of their hand if it’s a good one Collateral damage is great Vs. A luke and Epp han combo, opps no more combo lukes dead


Still works after tatooine, just get a hold on rendili or sullust to satisfy Mob. Points killer.
