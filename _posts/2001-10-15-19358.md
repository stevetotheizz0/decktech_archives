Strategy: '

this deck is a fairly standard light side pile deck, teched heavily against podracing.  same situation as with most 3po/mess decks...start careful planning to begin the two sites.  use slave quarters text to get shmi.  use shmi text to get 3po.  use 3po’s text EVERY TURN if possible to cycle thru your deck.  this combined with the hwgitm’s should enable you to get the majority of the twixes out of your deck and into play.  if your opponent isn’t podracing, ALWAYS put the high-destiny podracing interrupts back in your deck to get another card via 3po.  drain at your sites and force the opponent to do something (usually with sabres to boost the drain) and pounce on them when they come to you or when they  begin to set up.  you can also jump on their sites from the get go to disrupt their strat.  this deck is lots of fun to play and has helped me learn how to track (3po + artoo in red 5 + on the edge = lots of retrieval).  please leave constructive feedback...thanks for your time    '
