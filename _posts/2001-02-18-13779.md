Strategy: '

Play as you would deadbolt. pull madine, then pull ketwol with madine, and get a signal to pull ANSB. after ebo is set up, pull endor, and plop wedge and the falcon, with general cal, on it.

get the CC sights and put your mains in thier and drain. Your opponent will have to do something or else they will be drained for a lot. Your oppnent will have a tough time killing off your space. it may not seem like much but the space doesnt die to easily. but while thier fighting your space, drain them at cloud city. (or vice versa) you have enough ground power to fight off any force they through at you. 

While this is going on start the retrieval with the on the edge and off the edge’s, and then get them back with ketwols ability.

i’m still playtesting this deck and tuning it, its pretty good though.

thanks to clint hays for posting deadbolt and givinfg this deck a skeleton.
