Strategy: '

PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU REVIEW- The VCSDs have been changed to Dreadnaughts.

___________________________________________________________

Your objective is to get That Thing Operation within the first three or four turns. First turn- deploy IAO to get DSII DB and deploy Jerjerrod there. Use Moff to get sectors and Superlaser, then use Reactor Core to get TTO. Once that's going, move to one of your systems and start draining, plus make 'em lose 2 for TTO. Try to get Merrejk to the bunker early to utilize his text and Endor Shield's text.

This is a strong anti-LS space deck. With the Superlaser, you can easily knock out their capitals while the SFS cannons can take down their fighters (often even the SUPERFALCON).

To combat ground decks, try to get Vader, Tarkin, and the Emperor on their planet and spread and drain in space. If you're falling behind, just use Short-range Fighters to pick up some easy retrieval.

Try to keep the DSII involved in all space battles for the additional Capacitors destiny.

Most of all, have fun Blowing stuff up.
