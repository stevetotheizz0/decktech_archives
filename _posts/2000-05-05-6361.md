CARDLIST UPDATE I pulled a Sniper & Added Bossk in Hounds Tooth.

Well this is a Mains & Toys deck that's strength is battling. Try and get your sites out fast so that you can activate a lot of force, and the pound down. There are multiple copies of mostly all the good beat down characters which is a big plus when playing with this kind of deck. Also, against any non-space deck, pretty much forget draining and just battle galore (U can use some cards to force drain but concentrate on battles). Sniper is very nice combined with First Skrike (play sniper then battle, retrieve sniper). This deck just POUNDS Mains. The only deck I'd say it might lose to a big space drain. Otherwise it ROCKS CRUSH THE REBELLION 

AGAINST Hidden Base Start Security Precautions and get your sites out ASAP. Drain at your sites and DON’T deploy your starships until they flip. Unless they flip you should be able to out drain them. If they flip get Zuckess & Dreadnaghts (with forfit pilots) up there probing (Zuckess can take care of himself & use pilots on the dreadnaghts for forfit). Shouldn't be hard.

AGAINST Yavin 4 No revolutions Well you are gonna start Crush the rebellion but try to get Bad Feeling Have I out ASAP. Even with their EPP mains they will be no match for Darth & company. Use sense/alter to hurt them. If they are playing that CC On The Edge/Off the edge deck then catch one of those pair with TBHTP and sense the other pair. Then just BEATDOWN

AGAINST Yavin 4 Revolver Start Crush The Rebellion & again get BFHI out ASAP. Alter/Evader their Revolutions and beat on their mains.

AGAINST Operatives Start Battle Order, and what can I say...CRUSH THEM Choke ops, use sniper, battle. Not to hard to beat.
