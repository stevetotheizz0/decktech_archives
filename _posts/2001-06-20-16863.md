Strategy: '

update again  I’m not playing Cap’n Solo’s because Han’s too much of a pimp on the ground.  Lando with any pilot is good enough.  1 destiny, 8 power, immune < 7 (with my ao)

I think the capability to od the one-turn on the ground is more important, for a couple of reasons.  Fisrt I don’t forsee too much air at the next tournement I go to.  (and all I need to hold is Kessel)

Second I have been able to beat ISB space with just the air I have (so I have enough)  Also, I don’t like the card inefficiency (two cards vs. one)

This deck isn’t made to do the (euro) one-turn in the air.


Ummm... update I wanted feedback, not people saying ’I need some tight puss.y.’  Thanks Brad, but I’m ignoring your feedback, because I like Lando in Falcon ’cuz I’m not playing Cap’n Solos.  I also can’t fit in an ’artoo and threepio’, but i wouldn’t mind one and a ’were you lookin’ for me.’

If someone can tell me why this loses to another deck I BUILT (AOBS) then i’ll be happy.  and if you wanna see the aobs, check out my page.

Oh yea, A Place for My Head is a Linkin Park song, but it’s not as well-known as some other jank by them...  It’s one of my favorites...


First off, there is a negative chance I’ll lose the race.  ’A Step Backwards’ is the most Godly card for the ls in podracing.  This is the reason Sebulba is good because ONE of his destiny is sometimes better than TWO of my destiny.  BUT if the top destiny is pulled from each side, the light side still has a destiny left  This can do many things Nullify Sebulba’s Cheating, And it can be played when you’ve got a low card on top (that’s less than 3) so then you lose trash, and Sebulba loses a (3+destiny)

NOT ONLY THAT but All that AND ’Too Close for Comfort’ can be played from lost pile.  Oh yea, and my favorite bit of juicy podracing teck is the bay.  You can pull the bay, track a six.  Then control it, and lose a high-destiny card as the last drain, and replace it with your top race destiny.  If they comedown, remember to play ’Entering the Area’ AGAIN to add a destiny, and you get one for smugglers, and that’s a lot of destiny, and if you can track... that’s good. (ie. 6-5-5)


In the beginning of the game, keep in mind that holding to locations will win you the game Cantina and Kessel.  That’s a drain of 5, no modifiers, they pay to drain, putting bottom card of lost pile on force pile, etc.

In the beginning i sometimes hold the bay, and move to the Cantina later.  Kessel is a must 1st or 2nd turn. (of course, you want to play the game, not always my strategy...)


Then you’ll retreive 6, and they will lose six.  Then you’ll retreive four, and they won’t want to save force.  If you set up quickly, you be ’retreiving’ one every control phase. (Celebration isn’t in here because i never hold tatooine, only Kessel, and Endor Occupation can bury it)


By now, you can drop places with remaining smugglers.  You can do that tripler/one turn thing if you want to.  You can usually play it 3 times 2wice from hand, and once from pile.  Life Debt is cool, Han+Chewie=4 destiny.  The destiny in this deck is pretty good, and easy to track...  Whenever you have less power than them use the tripler, cause you get multiple destinies, and also they’re good.


In my area people have stopped teching against WYS, so if they do in yours, don’t give a bad rating because of that.

I’ve found that I can beat lots of decks, but I consistantly lose to the deck I built for my little brother. (AOBS) It’s called Why I Can’t go to Big Tournements’


Oh yea, Matchups  Play your own game, then go after them when your set up and you can pull of two tracked destiny...


I’m thinking about playing this deck at the team tourney at Mirk in Mn, but I dunnno, and I need more feedback.  Oh yea, and Me and S. Banwell (IA States winner) need one more player, d-mail me if you wanna go. Or e-mail me (kjedi@juno.com)     '
