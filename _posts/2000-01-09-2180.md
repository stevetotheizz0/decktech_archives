Strategy: '

The purpose with this deck is to get as many X-wings to tatooine as posible, and asap. when you have a bunch (be careful so they wont get batteled away, if you fear a beatdown, keep them at rendezvous point until you feel secure). each x-wing will add to your power at tatooine sites, so when the time is right, drop some tatooine sites, and a few ability 4 characters, and celebration. You have a smaller hit squad consisting of Ben and a few epps, along with the X-wing power they have good chances to beat ds away. There are also barriers and houjuxes in case of emergency. If you get this going, you should win. Throw high-destiny cards to force drain, retrieve and track them. The biggest problem is hunt down decks with dueling. This deck is a type that always win to some kinds of decks, and always loose to other types, so I don't expect the highest raknings. If it winns, it winns big though

the X-wing gun is a new addition to get dengar in p. away.
