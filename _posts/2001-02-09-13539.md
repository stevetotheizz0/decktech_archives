Strategy: '

i dont think this has been done before...i may start with the emipres new order if i play vs wys....take crysh out of start line up......other than that.....straight forward......myoom gets rid of everyone if you can..but ont rely on her...cause with wys...you want to battle....you got the duel cards you got the ships.....find merrjk at one point & get systems you dont have out out.....damn i’m tired i made it for tomorow & it’s 2 am   so i am off to sleep i’l add more to this when i got time '
