Strategy: '

Since I am in a super-fast mode, I am trying to think of decks that take forever to set up and make them quicker.  Enter Echo Base Operations.  The drain potential is through the roof, but the setup is the down fall to the deck. Enter the Recycler, utilizing the droid/HDWGITM combo, you can sift through your deck in record time.  The added retreival of EG-4 and off the edge is just icing on the cake.'
