DECK EDIT--forgot to add in scum 2x and first strike(LOL) take out masterful move, myo and a elis)

Deck EDIT #2--when i typed up this deck i made it off the top of my head, thus missing a few key cards, chall becan and bubo are in the edeck i actually physically made...i dunno how i found room for them, i think only one grabber and 2x none shall pas...
Ok--Its mkos, doesnt drain to win, battles to win, against space search and destroy and 3 drains of 2 will win you the game...
Screws set up crazy beatings...wins by alot.

VS. anything ground based-set up the audience chamber early on, try to get a hand that has beatdwon potential. Eventually theyll try to fight you somewhere, example, say you have mara at JP itself, tey deploy obi, barrier him, they deploy luke, you none shall pass him, then you screw the rest of his dudes.  Next turn you eli over and knock the @#$% outta obi.  This ill happen in all most all the games you play against LS mains.
Any questions dmail me...it aint the best deck but is strong..  '
