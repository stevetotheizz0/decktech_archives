Strategy: '

And Stebbins what was your record at Mirk???

And crush-hawk (don’t remember how you spelled that)Although not everyone plays Goo, I’ve seen that my alters can usually take care of it, and the senses can back up the sac war.


I dunno if the title is screwed up, but it’s supposed to be he back...  And I guess I forgot Onith was Female.  May Catherene McKinnon damn me to hell.  


The strategy to this deck is very simple.  1st or 2nd turn deploy Onith to the Docking Control Room.  (you pull the site, and he’s immune to battle damage)


After that, you just podrace, and pick out their characters.  Initiate one or two battles before the race is over...  wait for you to lose 11 cards.  Then you should have lost 11 cards...


Now is when the game actually starts.  Your lost pile consists of Sebulba’s racer, and theirs has overflow from a battle, a SACed card or two, some Onithed characters, and 11 random cards.  The turn after this deploy, and beat down all their stuff and then play search and destroy (If it was in hand) At the Mirkwood team tournement, I’ve had people just quit and draw up here, cause of the Lockdown.  


ummm, i’ll talk about other dex now, so this may be considered matchups...


Keeping The Empire out Forever is annoying as hell, cause they pull out a character after your control phase, and one during their turn, so Onith just sits there and balls.  But you can still sense those paths and beat on them (’cause CC dex rely on path too much)


I’ve beaten lotsa decks, and the only other one that gave me trouble was a hardcore EBO-X.  I was at the 12 card lost pile at turn 5, so I had to hurry.  Losing 11, plus sabers draining, plus search and destroy, (and my retreival) ended up being enough for me to scrape away with a win.


Ummm... profit, rst, tigih... they all lose to this deck.


I should probably add these cards, but didn’t cause i’m a scrub

   grabber

   sspft

   decree


Ummm... tell me what you think.  And don’t tell me to blow up Alderraan.  Bail Organa shoulda survived.


(oh yea, and if you care, at the mirk team tournement i went 2-1)  wins of 33, 35, and a loss by around 15. (i had crap for luck that game, and Keeping the Empire out forever sucks)


my team still got 11th place (outta 12) cause we’re scrubs.
