Strategy: '


***Changes I changed a few card in the deck from its last posting, i added Tantive 4, and removed endor, i decided to reduce the anount of systems as I try not to flip the objective anyway.  I also added two The signals to get out my much needed effects.

 This deck is balanced space and ground. You grab dagobah and the hut first. This gives you good activation then you continue to pull systems. Your start of haven makes stuff deploy almost free, you then amaass your ships ata few systems using your spies to take out visage(if they have it)or to block drains. You use the eep squads for beatdown or do drain if they dont have much ground. You dont fip unless you are forced too. This deck wins almost all the time, only had troubl against an operative numbers deck because i didn't get ou the plant its farthest froma nd battle plan, it should win most games if played by a skilled player.
