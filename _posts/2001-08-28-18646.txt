Strategy: 

Basically the strategy works the same as the first version ( Marilyn Maul and the Spooky Kids ).  The Phantom Menace was added for the insane destiny 7, and the immunity bonuses for Darth Maul.  The Bounty Hunter starships were added to counter decks that have few starships as well, such as QMC and WYS.  You all know how it works, so I wont bore you with the details.  Use your characters to take over your opponents key locations, like the Audience Chamber for Profit, the Bunker for RST, etc.  Basically, set up your sites, delpoy smart, battle smart and dont get yourself killed.
