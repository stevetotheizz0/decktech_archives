Strategy: 

Ok this is a really cool deck, I have played with hidden base for about One year, and I really have come to love ralltiir freighter captains, and kessel run. With this deck you get out all the systems quickly, and you start draining quickly, you stop drains with rebel fleet, barganing table, tk422, boushh, and two with hidden base, and with control and with it could be worse so that is a total of eight drains you can cancel WOW I mean when you are draining for ten in space and I dont know how much on ground with tk422 if you need, and boushh, and with luke and obi, I use two gift of the mentors, because it is amazing how many times one big beat down with those guys has won me the game, anyway so you stay up in space do kessel run, make sure if by chance they are using secret plans to save up the force, and then if they come into space you can run away with hyper escape, or you can battle them you draw battle destiny any way with the cool game text of the captains, when ralltiir is on table, and then you just put all of your cards back on table and it is good, also at then end retreive with allwings report in , and nar shadda wind chimes, also use those in the game to get out the captains and the freighters that they pilot, this light side, or a close version of it went undefeated at the Regionals at Wizards of the Coast Game Center in the university district, in seattle washington.

Please Rate/and review honestly, oh and by the way dont have all the cards in your hand so you dont get monnoked bad and then if by chance they do wich happend to me at regionals retreive it back any way , and by the way I ended up winning the game even though he monnoked me for a total of 12 cards, I know dumb me
