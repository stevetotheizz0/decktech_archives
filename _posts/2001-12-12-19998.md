Strategy: '

STRATEGY Every card in the deck either affects Jar Jar in some way, helps the podrace, sets up a beatdown, or attempts to manipulate the opponent.


Jar Jar Helper Cards


Jar Jar x3

Gimme a Lift x2

his Electrople

His Tank x2


Gimme a Lift is t3ch for an Episode 1 jar Jar deck, and as I see it, its rather impressive in the open {full} format as well. You let Jar Jar blow-up, drop him on the munchen, and take him back into hand {and recyclying and tracking a 5}. 


GOOD COMBO Jar Jar/Electrople + Qui-Gon/Saber = Good size Beatdown


Ya have Jar Jar hit someone with the ’trople making them power -2, then have him blow up and kill a DIFFERENT character, and then have Qui-Gon chop up whoever’s left. 


Opee Sea Killer does several things, ONE, it stacks one of their cards, thus reducing their deck by 1, TWO, it messes up their tracking a little bit {an experienced player should be able to overcome this though}, THREE, it can make them lose force {which is always a bonus}. 


There is 4 A Step Backwards to help me win the podrace. 


Barriers/It Could Be Worse’s help limit the damage.


The Ref.3 Qui-Gon and Strike Blocked are my Combat protection.


Reason for Kirdo III It gives me a drain of 1, 1 force to activate, an option to search my deck {to varify whats in it for destiny, etc.}, and it gives the opponent no options of a drain.


There’s everything ya should know...    '
