Strategy: 

Start with Cantina and Mos Eisley.	The true power of this deck is in getting the Cantina shuffle going very quickly.  I don't use the Obi's Hut/Tosche start because I prefer to get big drains early.  Obi or Luke should be on the table 1st or 2nd turn.  This deck generates lots of force (start with five force + there are 2-0 sites + Tunnel Vision) so deploying all the big guys isn't a problem.  Even if Battle Order is out there's enough force to pay for drains (or use the attach/deattach Landing Claw strategy).

Try to cripple the opponent early with drains of 3-4 force.  Right now DS is deadly in space so avoid the temptation to fight them there.  Just use the Landing Claws instead.	Use Blaster Deflection, Rebel Barrier and Put That Down to protect the Light Side from the bounty hunters w/ guns.  Sense/Alter is unexpected so use them to disrupt reacts, Scum and Villainy, etc.  There are many recycling 4's and 5's, making it possible to shoot or kill just about anything.	The high destiny of this deck, coupled with Tunnel Vision/COAS/Glancing Blow/Ben Kenobi makes it easy for the Light Side to win any duels.
