GAH--  forgot two cards, test 1(duh) and aniakins racer(high destiny= good chance to wina  race).  End update


Gah # 2--gah, guess my deck was only 56 cards...there supposed to be 2x i knows in the deck.

This deck plays alot like the machine...everybody who knows how to play dagobah knows that this was the best deck period beofre no escpae came out.  Once no escpae came out huntdown and mkos were tough matchups for this deck...But with addition of qui gonn, this deck is back to dominance and rolls over almost everything.

It went 3-1 at the DPC and 3-1 at the open.  At the DPC it lost to a mains decks playing 7 sense, 4 aletr and 2 control.  It sensed everything and I could not find my grabbers.  I also had horrible luck in taht game.  at teh open, it lost to scott lingrells garrison deck because teh direct damage on hoth is just too hard to ignore plus qui gonn cant fight on teh land becasue of ice storm.  It beat Huntdown, bhbm, court, cct, oregon dark deal, and ties during its two days at ramapo.


When explaining some of teh card choices let me first tell you what i thought was going to be big at ramapo  Mauls hut mains(starts mauls hut and JP), Rops, and DS big blue.  I knew I could dominate all three of these matchups.  


Against maul mains maul gets missing because of lost in teh wilderness and you put down projections...drain in space.  Game over.


Rops  Qui and luek or obi take a site, superfalcon at ralitiir.  Flip them back and drain.  Lost in the wilderness and projections are hugely.


Big Blue.  Fight fast in space.  You win.


Other decks I didnt expect were dark deal, cct, and lost of huntdown but this deck handles them with ease.  In one of my games against oregon dark deal; i deployed test 1, farmboy, yoda and the training area 1st turn and tested 2nd turn...ummm dark deal eat my @#$% while i @#$% on your mom.


The deck plays diffrently against everythinbg and you gotta have a feel of how to play it and also play with slow style.  In all  my games I was down by 10 force early in the game.  

 The deck is a beats and it is very consistant.  Dmail if you got questions.  A TR will be up later in teh week and you will be able to see hwo the deck works better.  later all.  -Justin.     '
