Strategy: '

This is the deck that I found very effective early on in its inception after the release of death star II. It has had many overhauls as new sets are released, but none have affected it so powerfully as tatooine.

Turn 1-Starting setup deployed. Pull emperor palpatine, force lightning, emperors power, death star II docking bay, and Wakeelmui.

Turn 2-Deploy endor landing platform. Deploy any dark jedi and try to get thier weapons with them also. With coruscant this will be simple using maul strikes. Hold TIEs in hand early on. In order for them to be effective you must be able to support them with dreadnaughts or all power to weapons.

Turn 3- Begin draining as quickly as you can. Early force loss is important in the late game. If your opponent was not prepared to lose a card it could cause severe damage to thier win scenario. Try to battle before you move to capture luke. Always fight at least once before you move to take him. Rise, friend is an excellent way around insurrections limitation to movement and can drop vader in a very advantageous spot. Also it can keep you from getting stuck at the *** endor scout sites while holding luke and left to take damage from your own objective.

Turn 4- Be looking to get janus greejatus with the emperor. Use his text to put force lightning back in your deck and then go to draw it, use this as your main search/location technique in the deck until you have mauls e-binoculars on table. Or if opponent isnt using changing the odds dont worry about abusing this search technique.

Strategy side notes-
This deck plays very well on the ground but will have to be played very carefully in space to control any threats there. Hidden Base and other dedicated space themed decks will be dificult to keep up with, but still defeatable. Because space needs sites youll be given extra activation which is essential to your success with this deck type so dont worry too much. In order to hurt you they first have to help you, and that is very dangerous. U-3po is in to help deal with opponents ground drains in places you dont want to go.Ghaana Gleemort is also helpfull in this area. You will need to get maul on table with his e-binocs at some point, just be sure to fully utilize him in your battles and duels. He alone could break your opponents game plan.

Matchups-

Jedi Pile- Untested versus this archtype as of yet.

Watch Your Step- You get to add just as many additional destinies as your opponent in this matchup in many cases. 4-lom also deals with talons text nicely returning those other smugglers to scrub status until end of turn. If mauls around sniper them off the table while your opponent grits thier teeth. Wait to take space away from them. Youll truly need three to four ties and a dreadnaught or all power to weapons to come out of that fight well off. Surprise him with a lot of damage then just forfeit them if opponent tries to take back the system, your damage is done and opponent now expects all power to weapons. Dont forget about your sienar fleet systems retrieval loop. Battle, lose, deploy again and retreave what you just lost.

Echo Base Ops- Theyll start a drain race with you here so watch out. Again Drain early and often. The only direct damage this deck has is if luke isnt at a battle ground site, so play well.

Podracing- Youll lose the race. So? Drop six from hand and call it good. Move on and battle, theyll lose more than 6.

Rebel Strike Team- Unknown as of yet. Havent played it.

Profit- Flip it early on get rid of his heavy hitters and combo engine cards early as you can. After that remember to drain and damage your opponent often.

Mind What You Have Learned- This will work to your advantage if luke is testing or not. Its not an offense deck. It relies on being able to react to your movements and then bring you to dagobah. The only lame thing is that theyll retreave ten on you and then come out of the box for fun.Use characters other than Vader to deal with the new jedi want to be. Yoda at the hut will also mess with your attrition so be careful when you battle and what order if you have multiple battles you can wage.

Quiet Mining Colony- Get there and do some serious damage to them fast. Dont let them set that mess up on you. It can get deadly very fast if you dont pay attention.

Rescue the princess- Dont let them have her. If she doesnt go free you dont have to worry and they cant really retreave a whole lot. Space variants can be bothersome but if you play cautiously youll overcome your opponents space module.

Hidden Base- Ive already mentioned some things about this deck.

Well thats all Ive got for now so let me know what you think. Thanks.   '
