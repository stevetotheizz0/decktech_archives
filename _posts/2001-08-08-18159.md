Strategy: '

Changes- Switch Darth Vader for Lord Vader, switch IAO and Secret Plans to the combo card and Security Precations, switch 1 Masterful Move to the new combo.


The deck almost plays itself. Your first objective

is to win the race. This is done with the help of

Sebulba (who always wins), 2x Hit Racer, and 3x

Podracer Collision. This deck has never lost a race,

especially because 33 of the cards are destiny 3 or

higher (after starting the game). You win the race in 

4-5 turns usually, and retrieve your lost pile. The next

thing to do, is to set up nubmers. Palpy and Tech Mo’r 

go to the throne room, while Vader (EPP usually) goes

and kills all your opponents high-destiny characters.

Insight is no problem, because the deck can win without

using numbers. The TIEs are huge especially against EBO,

Hidden Base, and Watch Your Step. Against any non-space 

deck (Harvest Mains, RST) and Quiet Mining Colony, you

own space. Plus, in those decks especially, most of the 

characters you see are mains. Tht means low destiny for 

the race, and a low total for numbers. Also, this is not

a flipping deck, BHBM is just a platofrm. This is why there

are EPP Vaders and not Lord Vader and DVDLOTS.


Match-ups


Watch Your Step You own space. All Power to Weapons, 4 

Interceptors, cannon = win for you. Most of these start

Insight, so EPP Vader does suicide runs in key spots, and

Emperor and Tech Mo’r give you a recycleable 5 in Force

Lightning.

Rebel Strike Team (non racing) Rebel Strike Team has very

little space, so you can take that pretty easily. A well 

timed EPP Vader beatdown in the Bunker is key, especially 

if they’re about to blow up the Bunker. Numbers will work

here because General Solo, Crix, and Blount gives them a

total of 4 to your 12. Lose 8 please.

Any racing deck This is your toughest match-up. They will

give you a run for your money, but most likely you will come

out on top. Depending on the objective they use, you may need

to ditch Watto’s Box for Imperial Arrest Order. If it is WYS

racing, then you must do this. Your interrupts are very 

valuable yo you during the race, as well as Sebulba’s cheating

ability. After teh race make sure you play smart, especilly if

you lost it (which shouldn’t happen).

Quiet Mining Colony This is a decent mtch-up. Alot of these

decks start Insight as well, but alot of people will ditch it

for Battle Plan, Menace Fades, or Honor of the Jedi. This is 

when you strike with odds. Also, in space, and early presence

at Bespin can be game-altering. If you can get Bossk and/or

Dengar there with some TIEs by 2nd turn, you should be good.


Thats about it, if you have any questions, please D-MAIL me 

BEFORE reviewing the deck so I can clear stuff up. Thanks.  '
