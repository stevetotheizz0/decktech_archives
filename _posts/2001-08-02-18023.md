Do, Or Do Not & Wise Advice

Strategy: '

Turn 1- Depending on what your opponent plays, you might immediately drop your insight... to get honor out on the table quickly. Either try to get Mirax or Dash in space with ship and pull Corellia or Kessel for the run later in the game. Hold your ground characters in your hand until you can deploy two at the same time.


Turn 2- Deploy your second system and another smuggler to a system if you can and flip to stop sense and alter. By now they should see the necessity of controlling the cantina and deploy as much as they can there. Try to have Threepio on the table, if not get he and Artoo down before you battle.Theyll greatly hamper your opponents attrition. 


Turn 3- This is when you should be ready to deal out some damage in battle. Use Threepio to get a sorry.. & blaster prof. If you can, try to have either Han or Chewie and Talon to deploy then, by all means do so. Even better is Han or Chewie with mercenary armor and a blaster. If you have to, just deploy Talon and then play out of somewhere to get either Han or Chewie to the battle, this is my favorite way to do it, because I choose which one I want to use. When you battle and use a blaster youll more than likely draw a three for weapon destiny and then be able to use the blaster prof. to remove even dark jedi from your path of opposition. Then add you additional destinies. Next, if you can play its not my fault from hand and then from lost pile to give your smugglers immunity to attrition. 


The rest of the game will be a cat and mouse  match depending on your opponents deck, but you have the ability to cancel battles and remove thier characters and problem opposition outside of the battle phase. And to me that is a huge plus with a deck like this. Mobility will be what wins you the game as well as your destiny draw average of three.


I havent had a chance to test this deck yet so the matchup section is all going to be theoretically speaking. Keeping that in mind please judge accordingly. 


Matchups-


Hunt Down- Theres no one for them to duel, and honor will give them all sorts of head aches. This would still be a tough match based solely  on the decks sheer power,  but your destinies will aid in ridding the table of dark jedi when combined with your blaster prof.s. If podracing is popular in your area, try  subbing in it could be worse to take care of the damage.


BHBFM- This is a problem since Luke isnt in the deck. Itd become a drain race depending upon how soon they get Vader on the table. You may want to think about control, and it could be worse to minimize your losses. Or just put in a Luke rebel scout. Then when opponent deploys Vader to capture Luke and then battles, use out of somewhere to get another character and add them to the battle. Then use Lukes text to take Vader out of the fight, almost totally ensuring that the opponent will lose badly.


Carbon Chamber Testing- Can be a big problem. This and court decks are very challenging, but this one more than any other because it can effectively neutralizes Han with Jabbas prize before the game even begins. Since this deck isnt widely played any longer you shouldnt have to worry. If you do come up against it, just try to free Han as quickly as you can. You might even go as far as to put in Luke, jedi knight and jedi mind trick.


Speed Deal- This is a tough matchup. Just try not to let them control the required sites to set up the deal. If they get it youll definitely lose the game before too long. Get your offense down fast and dig in for a hard fought game.


Start Your Landing/ISB OPS- Im not exactly sure how these decks would do matched up with each other. I havent seen anyone play it yet to know.


SYCFA/TIEs- This is almost impossible to beat unless you try really hard and play very well. Almost always sub in it could be worse  and anything else you can think of to block drains. Drain as heavily on the ground as you can, and let your opponent spread out in space so you may have a chance to beat him down in space later in the game. The kessel run becomes valuable in this matchup. The retrieval of this deck can be difficult to deal with unless you sub in aim high. 


Raltiir OPS- This deck could give you some headaches if youre not careful. Youll need to get to Raltiir to keep them from flipping and adding to thier battle destinies and enhancing thier drains (?). Maybe sub in menace fades? Other than that, drain at your own sites heavily to draw him to you so you can set him up for the fall. Like I said earlier, this is all theory.


Is That Legal?- This deck will cause problems in all sorts of fashions. It alters destinies and the opponents reacting. Senators will cause mayhem with this and most other decks in the near future. And to top it off, you wont be able to kill the buggers easily either. (Picture this; Is That Legal, Galactic Senate, Desert Landing Site, Start Your Engines, Sebulbas Podracer, I Will Find Them Quickly, Master, Boonta Eve Podrace, and the Podrace Arena) Smells like trouble doesnt it?


Okay thats all I can think of for now, so as either more comes to me or I respond to my reviewers, Ill consider updating the strategy. Thanks.    '
