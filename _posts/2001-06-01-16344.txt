Strategy:
_______________UPDATE #1_________________________
To Tim- The walkers are a main part of the deck! The AT-ATs need to be in there to get the bonus from walker garrison. Honor won’t be a problem. From the start, you get 2 battlegrounds (3rd marker and the docking bay) and there are 2 presence of the force to make battlegrounds AND there are 2 Hoths and a Rendili.
______________End Update_________________________

Basically the point of this deck is to spread out on Hoth and drain them to death with the walker garrisons,and control the Hoth system and have them loose force form rebel base occupation, YMSYL and We’re in attack position now. Every turn they loose force from YMSYL as long as you control a marker site with a AT-AT they loose force, which can add up to a lot of force lost early on. Also towards the end of the game when you have all of your generals and commanders out, the Admiral’s orders cards can add up making them loose force in addition to the force lost because of YMSYL. They can be loosing upwards from about 6 force towards the end of the game when you have all three of the cards out. You must control Hoth to make this work though. The Chimarea with Grand Admiral Thrawn and Captain Pellaeon is devastating. A power 14, immune to less than 8 (with the admiral’s orders), 2 destiny and enough forfeit to make anyone happy, all for 13 force. Add on Admiral Chiraneau for an extra drain bonus and make the light side loose 2 force from a drain on Hoth. 

First turn: Start with the 5th marker and the other effects. Immediately pull out Rendili with Mob points and also pull out a walker garrison and 3rd marker from the reserve deck with YMSYL. Pull the docking bay with IAO also. Your real generation will come on turn 2. You might want to deploy a character, or if your opponent lets you activate enough, a walker to the docking bay for the extra generation. If you suspect that they might come down to battle though, hold back until turn 2.

If the light side does decide to come down to battle though, trample them to death. Go for the smaller characters like Han and Wedge because the overall destiny in the deck is pretty low, but don’t worry because even if you miss a trample, the hulking mass-of-steel behemoth of an AT-AT will crush all opposition. 

Nevar Yalnal- There are three spies in this deck. Not only are they good and have a high forfeit, but you can play this great card with them. If the opponent has had enough of your walker garrison drains, and decides to deploy an undercover spy, hammer them with this. It is almost guaranteed to work. Just have your spy sit inside a walker and there will be no chance of them getting hit. If they deploy a corren horn or a general cracken just use this card and it might turn the tide of a battle. Also it is a destiny 6 so you can’ t go wrong. 

You might want to make a few changes such as putting in another Commander Igar and take out a General Veers or Officer Evax. If you do this you might also want to put in another Tempest 1 and take out a Blizzard 2.  

Have fun with this one.
