Strategy: '

Ok, I start Bespin with CC North Corridor for good activation and so nI can cancel their drains if they plan on coming down on my turf.  Battle Plan is a must to get out if they're playing Ops, since I will be on ground and in space with CC Celebration anyways.  Major 'SAC' going on in this deck  My mains should have no problem whoopin the dark side on CC or draining.  Hunt Down, just Nabrun someone to the Holotheatre to cancel Visage  The deck is pretty smoothrunning and not too difficult to play  Enjoy '
