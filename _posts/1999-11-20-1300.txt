Strategy: '

The deck is basically about draining, but can battle a lot too.
With the movement restriction on the bunker, its an almost certain +2 for a drain. After a while some spy will come down, most of the time with an Epp squad, so there is a ghhhk. In case you lose force from that battle, doesn't matter, go in space and drain. Obviously, this deck has its weaknesses, but its great fun to play. Against MWYHL you'll drain him out on Endor and Kiffex, and with a good-timed failure you'll make his testing disappear. Against m&T, just go in space and drain. I think (speeder)ops are gonna be a problem, but i haven't encountered one so far. With Raithal you can pump up your destiny.
Basic idea is to have fun, battle a lot and hopefully win something too. Good luck and if you have specific questions, mail me at pietkaboutermuts@hotmail.com.'
