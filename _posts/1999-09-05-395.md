Strategy: '

This deck uses HB to get a good amount of force going. It then will set up in space, and use EPP hit squads to kill oponnents guys. Once you know where high destinies are, feel free to put out Obi/Luke against Epic Duel. Cancel Visage with a bothan, and give him some back up. Fights well in space and ground. beats ops, ISB, black and blue, and more. Requires high playskill to use effectively.'
