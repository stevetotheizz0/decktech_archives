Strategy: '

The starting effect for this deck is usually
Yarna d'al' Gargan so you are protected from
Monnok. Try to occupy two battlegrounds as
quickly as possible so Yarna is immune to Alter.

The force generation for this deck is excellent,
so you should be able to deploy a fearsome force
in a short space of time.

Now, depending on your opponent, you decide to
spread out and drain or overpower the dark side
in battles.If you decide to do the latter, try
to get organized attack, S-foils,and Draw Their Fire.
Keep Houjix in your hand if you decide to spread.

This deck cancels force drains efficiently by
the objective and It's a Hit and ICBW. Also
if you decide to flip, make sure you have enough
force so you can use ICBW to prevent the damage
from Security Precautions.

The characters in this deck are very useful if your
opponent spreads out too much. If they do this,
beat them down with EPPs.

This deck has ways of going against the main dark
strategies. There is transmission terminated for
HDADTJ. Battle Plan is very useful against ISB and
Operatives, as are EPPs. You may consider starting
Battle Plan against ISB and Ops. Ultimatum is
useful against insert decks by minimising damage from
inserts. Also there is Do, Or Do Not to make your
opponent lose force for their Sense and Alters.

Also remember to get All Wings Report In so you
can get a bigger force differntial.

NB Flip the objective when you have depleted their
space fleet or you have ICBW to prevent the damage
from Security Precautions.   '
