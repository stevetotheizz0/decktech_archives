Ok first off, if there are any problems in the deck like typos, thats because i used deckmaker to do this, and it's not my fault, i tried to find all the mistakes.

This deck uses heading for the medical frigate to bring out 3 effects including a very important one, 'Squadron Assignments'. this cards allows you to reveil any unpiloted starship, and take its matching pilot from the reserve deck and deploy both simutaniously or vice versa. and since the bulk of the ships are red/gold squadrons, and all the matching pilots are in the deck, that becomes very useful. the millenium falcon and the b-wings are just there to help a little bit, but they can be substituted for anything else that may prove useful. Rendezvous Point allows starships to deploy -2, so that the starting location. i put in one location from each sector, so that you can forcedrain if the opponent wont battle you.

this deck has not been tested, so please let me know what you think of it....'
