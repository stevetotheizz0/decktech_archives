Strategy: 

Play like a normal mains deck. But you should always have huge activation by turn 2. I usually generate 12-15 on my third turn, and what can’t you do with that much force?

If you don’t have 5 emperors, you could probably just use more walkers. I dont really use the garrisons, I’d much rather just play huge beats.

Specifics:
Scanning Crew- After all their sheilds are pulled, use Khurgee to loop this over and over. I didn’t use this in the tournament, but it has huge potential.

Emperor Palpatine- Destiny 6. Searchs for an easily trackable 5. Gives you an extra force. Flips the LSCombat objective at the Naboo DBay. What else do you want?

Naboo DBay- Drop Palpatine and another DJedi there. They gotta fight, or they cant drain. Instead of going for the beatdown, make them come to you.

Walker Garrison- Use 2 so that it doesnt matter if you get one in your opening hand, so you can still pull the Defensive Perimeter. I actually got one off in the tournament, but it’s definitly not neccessary.

He Hasn’t Come Back Yet- Make someone missing? works for me.

Tournament report coming later this week, i hope.

As always, contact me if you have any admirals orders available. im almost over 900.
