Strategy: '

This isn’t a drain deck, its a battle deck.  In
fact, the drains are weak in this deck.  But
everyone eventually deploys to Tatooine (cuz they
don’t wanna lose a force to Court), and that’s
when I capture and feed.  Plus, most people come
to Tatooine *expecting* me to eventually get some 
big drains going, so like I said, I eventually get
them to come.

If not, I setup drains at Sullust and Tatooine,
setup Occupation and Search & Destroy, and hope I
win.  Its pretty easy to get my systems w/Merrijk,
then I put him in Zuckuss’ ship so he doesn’t 
suspend Scum.  My aliens deploy dirt cheap when
Jabba, Chall, Scum, and the Sail Barge are out.
If all 4 are out (and at the same site), my aliens
deploy -4  Usually Jabba and Chall are at the 
Chamber, while the Barge is at the Pit, so my 
aliens deploy -3 to either site.  Barge can be 
pulled, Scum can be drawn or Twi’leked for, and
the Chamber can pull an alien once per game to
help me setup those 4 for cheap deploy.

common matchups

vs. WYS

Let them have Tatooine, just build up at the
sites.  Then deploy ships to the docking bay, 
using the barge w/aliens to defend the ships.  
When you’re ready, move the ships up to greet Dash
and Mirix, and battle ’em the hell outta there
If they move away to Kessel, just follow.  The 
Admiral’s Order works great since they only get 1 
destiny on Tatooine.  Just hope they don’t
replace it.  If they do, obviously track that 6

vs. HB, Y4, EBO, or Tatooine mains

Build up at your 2 BG sites, Jabba will be the 
alien you almost always pull (maybe Chall if you
want the Merc Pilot w/him).  Twi’lek or draw for
Scum, deploy aliens for cheap.  Don’t capture 
unless you can hold on to that captive.  there’s
nothing worse than having captives escape.  You
want to feed them to Sarlacc.  So capture guys 
like lando, Solo, chewie, and scrubs for easy
meals.  Leave the ability 4 guys alone unless 
that’s all you have to feed.

vs. EBO, HB space decks

You should be able to occupy a BG system 
(preferably Tatooine w/Occupation).  Put forfeit
fodder on Bossk’s ship and Jabba’s Cruiser.
Watch for xwing cannons (in any deck).  Setup
Search & destroy to hurt the light side, hopefully
they deploy to Tatooine so you can get a meal for
Sarlacc.  Hutt Influence protects your drains.

vs. Rebel Strike Team

Kill Crix.  He is key.  If not, they’ll pull Cpl.
Midge who adds 1 to force drains at Endor sites.
That will finish you.  U-3PO can block a drain, 
but S&D will be useless.  Tat Occupation can help,
and buildup at Tatooine sites, looking for Elis.
Then Elis to Endor (whether Insurrection is out
or not), and battle ’em up.  Don’t capture cuz
you’ve got nowhere to take the captives to.

vs. TIGIH

Tough matchup (in my experience).  You’ve got the
power to take Luke out though, especially if you
buildup at Tatooine and Elis over.  Typically this
decktype plays Fallen Portal, which stings.  But
if they deploy to Tatooine, capture and feed.  It
can be a 10-12 force swing, even more in some 
cases.

vs. Profit/Agents in the Court

Don’t like having the Chamber converted.  Use CC
Engineer to reconvert.  If they use Underworld
Contacts, the site will be converting constantly.
Hopefully you outactivate them and since your guys
deploy cheap, you’ll have force to convert more 
than they can.  At least you’re almost certain to
have them deploy to tatooine so you can get 
captives.  I start Jabba & Chall (w/CC Enginner) 
against Profit.

vs. MWYHL

Lock down your 2 sites, play S&D.  Try to setup
Tat Occupation too, and lock down the system.
They’ll probably play Honor, but you can get 3 BGs
pretty quick.  Plus that 2 extra force Dagobah 
gives you can go a long way.  Heck, I’ve even
invaded Dagobah w/Bossk’s ship carrying a hit
squad on like the 5th or 6th turn

FAQs

Xizor?  Snoova?  Don’t have much Reflections 2 
yet, but those 2 aliens will definetely go in once
I get them (which will be soon).

More Tatooine sites?  With more sites, it becomes
too easy to occupy a Tatooine BG, making my Court
damage useless.  By limiting where they can 
deploy, they play right into my hand.  If they 
deploy to the pit, what if I have Sarlacc in hand?
It’ll eat their guys right up.

Small drains?  Hey, I can handle big drains.  With
Occupation, its like an extra drain, plus Court
damage is another drain.  When they deploy to 
Tatooine, the damage Sarlacc causes is huge.  I
try not to rely on Sarlacc, but I guess its a 
pretty big part of my deck.  But I have won
several games without feeding.

This deck is 5-7 in tournament play, and has 
played virtually every decktype (except RST).  
TIGIH seems to give this deck the most trouble.
