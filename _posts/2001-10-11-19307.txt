Strategy: '

 
Training always beats me, so I thought that I would make a training deck...hey, why not, since I never get to play this f.ucking game anymore anyway.


why it works... 

well first you only have a six card start which is pretty good considering some of the massive starts some have. The fact that you give your opponent 2 force and you only get 3 sucks, but you only need 3 to bust out yoda so that works out fine. Another reason it works is the destiny 7 in everything once you flip, plus massive retrival, when you flip allyour peeps are immune to attrition less then 4(test three subtracts one from destiny and yoda lops two off the attrition) o yea, and don&#8217;t let anyone tell you you need battle grounds, if your opponent has none, just kill em with test 6, if they have some, take em over, is this so hard? 
so first turn you wanna go through and pull the hut, if its in there, if not you have some @#$% luck, that has never happened to me, same with yoda, who you drop to the hut this turn, he doesn&#8217;t move the rest of the game. 
second turn assuming you don&#8217;t get @#$% luck and put daughter in your massive 6 card forcepile go ahead and drop her, if in hand drop her, just get her out. get the training area, get test one, play test one(on opponents turn get test two) 
turn three 
well you should complete test one, you need a four, and the destinys in here are decent to say the least, pull the jungle, drop test two there and pull test three, move to test two(opponents trun pull test 4) 
turn 4 
complete your test, you need a four again, drop test three, it&#8217;s immeadiatly done(this is all assuming your opponent is smart and doesn&#8217;t move test two to the hut), pull the swamp drop test 4 , go there, get test 5 
turn 5 
complete test 4 grab the bog clearing, drop that, drop test 5 at the hut( that is beyond key, otherwise bubo might make an appearance, and remember leia has 2 landspeed) 
turn 6 
flip leia, i&#8217;m hoping by this point you tracked your 7, if not, you have another 2 turns thats more then enough time, and btw you want as few cards in reserve as possible in case they pull the omni box, which nobody is smart enough to play with 
turn 7 
chill, draw your 7, get 10 force, this is assuming secret plans isn&#8217;t out, and if it is, m&#8217;eh you got alot of force activated 

well thats the jist of it anyway, this whole thing i just wrote assumes they do nothing these 7 turns, well you got stuff to keep em from doing stuff, let&#8217;s look 

battle plan slows most drain decks, and if they foolishly go to an exterior planet site drop a projection, or lose them in the wilderness, plus you got it could be worse to stop some damage 

a gift this will help soooo much vs mykos or court, this is why there are 2 artoos, which btw they can pull a gift 

honor, get it some how, YISYW gets it, so does signal 

the beatdown crew 
now i&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re saying, god damn that is the worst character selection i&#8217;ve ever seen, well maybe it is, but nobody plays huntdown dueling around here, so i don&#8217;t have to worry about luke or obi going out of play, and the luke han combo is awesome, 9 force for 9 power, two weapons and two destinys, when you flip that is just insane, and before the flip that&#8217;s usually enough to clear a site, vs court if you think they&#8217;re gonna be eaten, thats what strangle/whaaaaaoooow are for, read em if you don&#8217;t know what they do. 

as far as test 6 goes, it&#8217;s mainly just direct damage if they don&#8217;t play with vader, and if they do, feel free to take leia there.


That’s all for now, catcha on the flip side.  Later
