Reasons for some cards over others.

Hidden Base I like the flip side, plus it’s a good fake.
Kirdo III Having a parsec of only 1, it is separated from the other systems by 5 parsecs, meaning only Zuckuss and Dengar can get to and from it.  It’s also a drain zero system for the dark side.
Characters are all scouts who can be pulled by Madine, or scouts who add to FD with Midge, or Obi, or Luke.  I don’t have any Jedi Lukes or he would be in instead.
Ships all have matches, thus pulled with Squassin and helped by the AO.
Locations are good systems and good sites
Interrupts are anti-Hunt Down (which I am deathly afraid of) or keep my generals safe, or pull effects.
Effects are self-explanatory

How to play the deck

First turn pull Crix and Cal with Strike, pull GS1 with Squassin, put Cal aboard at RP and move to Endor.  Get Crix down, protected by scouts.	Pull Wuta for sites and Midge for help with the drains.  Get one of the Talas at Endor with back-up for Close Air support.  Drain like mad.

Certain decks.

HD Trans. Term. ASAP, or spy to holotheatre.  Keep Obi and Luke off ground, try and stay in space as they will not have much.

BHBM See above, just without the cancelling Visage part.  Give them Luke.  That’s why I want a Jedi.

Pure space TIE’s and Big Blue are troublesome.  Forget the flip and go for holding Endor and draining on the ground.  This is a tough match.

This deck can beat most ground decks but falters against heavy space decks.  Good Luck. '
